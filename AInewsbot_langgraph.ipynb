    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhoutee score\n"

In response, companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to fill the gaps. One such future-oriented development is unfolding at a state-of-the-art synthetic rubber plant in Yokkaichi City, Mie Prefecture.\\nAt this facility operated by ENEOS Materials, an unprecedented milestone has been achieved: full plant operation without human monitoring, made possible by AI-based control systems.\\n\"This is the control room that manages the entire plant,\" explained Ryota Tate from the production division. Remarkably, the room is completely unmanned.\\nThanks to the newly implemented AI system, the plant runs autonomously. Previously, workers were required to monitor the plant around the clock and manually adjust valves related to waste heat recovery every 15 minutes. The task involved reading roughly 20 data points and instantly deciding the optimal valve position—an act that once demanded the instincts of experienced technicians.\\nNow, AI replicates these skills, making real-time adjustments with no human involvement. This breakthrough marks the first time globally that a plant of this kind has achieved autonomous operation using AI alone.\\n\"The AI keeps operations running at an optimal level, allowing us to shift our time toward other process improvements,\" said Tate.\\nIn addition to boosting efficiency, the system has also cut energy use and CO2 emissions by about 40%. The driving force behind this leap? Japan’s advanced AI robotics technology.\\nAt Nara Institute of Science and Technology, researchers have developed AI robots capable of learning through trial and error. One experiment involves teaching a robot to flip a handkerchief from its green side to its red side. At first clumsy, the robot gradually expands the red area and begins to \"reward\" itself—encouraging continued learning. Within four hours, it masters the task entirely on its own.\\n\"This mechanism is very similar to how humans and animals learn through praise,\" said Professor Takamitsu Matsubara. \"Our goal is to build AI robots that can genuinely work in place of humans.\"\\nBridging the gap between lab and industrial site is Yokogawa Electric.

The unmanned, AI-controlled factory now stands as a model for the future.\\n\"With declining birthrates and fewer successors in skilled trades, AI could serve as an apprentice—running plants temporarily until the next generation is ready,\" Kanokogi added.\\nAI is no longer just a support tool—it’s becoming a reliable partner in the workplace.

How do recruiters protect themselves?\\nSocial card description: Some hiring managers are fighting fire with fire and using AI to sort out who might be using the technology for less scrupulous reasons.\\nWhile most job seekers are using artificial intelligence tools for basic help, like assistance writing a cover letter, some may be using the technology to forge documents and create fake resumes, said RJ Frasca, vice president of channels and partnerships at Shield Screening.\\nOne way companies are combating dangerous applications is by fighting fire with fire and using AI in screening platforms to sort out who might be using the technology for less scrupulous reasons. As job candidates are “using more AI to get through filters, [hiring managers] are using more AI to fight those filters,” he said.\\nHere’s what hiring managers need to know.\\nThe AI-enabled candidate problem\\nAI, especially for younger candidates who may be taught how to use generative AI in high school and college, has become part of the job-seeking process. That use is typically harmless, said Joe Jones, director of research and insights for the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a nonprofit that defines, promotes and improves privacy and AI-related professions.\\n“They’re trawling various databases and networks to see what’s available,” said Jones. Others are using it “in a way to generate content to support their application,” like responding to questions, uploading resumes and creating a cover letter template.\\nGenerative AI starts to become a problem when it’s used not as a tool, but the “be all and end all” of the job hunting process, he said, with candidates solely relying on AI to fully write cover letters and resumes that are not personalized, or providing responses to questions that don’t actually answer what is being asked.\\nDeepfake technology, which also relies on AI, has only gotten more convincing. According to a report from finance software provider Medius, just over half (53%) of businesses in the U.S. and U.K. have been targets of a financial scam powered by deepfake technology, with 43% falling victim to such attacks.\\nHR professionals might not think this is their problem, but hiring is a potential entry point for criminals, as they can put themselves onto hiring platforms and steal company software, install malware, or worse.\\nAt the end of 2024, for example, threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant warned that North Korea-backed remote IT workers had infiltrated “dozens” of Fortune 100 companies through deepfaked video interviews and stolen personally identifiable information.\\nFighting fire with fire\\nBut AI can help recruiters defend themselves against bad actors, too. Candidate uses AI to make a fake diploma? “There’s a flip side of that, where AI is being used to dig deeper and verify” whatever documents or information candidates are presenting, said Frasca.\\nAI can also be used to verify a candidates’ identity, by doing a live screen of their face and comparing it to a government ID database, he added.\\nOn video calls, AI can be used to detect when the person you’re talking to isn’t really there, or an altered version of someone else. AI can spot patterns “that are more prevalent in deepfakes than in human cases,” said Jones, like eye contact and voice intonations. “There’s all sorts of analysis on the presentation of a person” that can be detected.\\nBut companies shouldn’t just add an AI program or deepfake detector to their platforms, set it and forget it. “The technology’s capabilities need quite a bit of human oversight,” said Frasca, especially if companies are using it for more than just detecting potential fraud, but to sort through candidates and applications.\\nHR departments using AI also need to make sure that “bias doesn’t creep in when the AI is being used,” said Jones. An AI could make inferences in gender, race or other protected characteristics. It could, for example, scan a resume and assume the applicant is a woman, and make inferences about the candidate from that determination. “Bias can creep in — or more than creep,” he said.\\nNotably, job seekers are also wary of employers that rely on AI tools for the hiring process; around 3 in 5 job hunters surveyed by Express Employment Professionals and Harris Poll said they would consider not applying to companies that rely on generative AI.\\nAnd while legislation around AI is still in its infancy, existing laws on things like privacy, copyright and IP are being applied to it, which HR managers should be mindful of. “In the context of AI, privacy laws, quality laws, and nondiscrimination laws still apply,” Jones said.'}\n",

Is it silly to use AI to review it?\\nI'm Daksh, a co-founder of Greptile. Our product uses AI to review pull requests to surface bugs and anti-patterns that humans might miss. Here is an example of what that looks like.\\nRecently, I was curious to see if there exists a power law in the number of PRs opened by individual Greptile users. In other words - were some users opening orders of magnitude more PRs than others? A quick SQL query later, I discovered that there is a power law to this.\\nI also noticed something else very interesting:\\nAt the far left of the long list of GitHub usernames was “devin-ai-integration[bot]”. An AI bot was writing more pull requests than any individual human. [1]\\nSeeing as Devin uses the same LLMs under-the-hood as Greptile, it does raise an interesting question - should the author be the reviewer?\\n[1] Granted that this is somewhat of a technicality. Devin’s contributions across many orgs are being counted in aggregate here. It would be more accurate to treat “Devin @ Company A” and “Devin @ Company B” as separate entries in this chart.\\nShould the Author Be The Reviewer?\\nMost software companies wouldn’t want the PR reviewer to be the same person as the PR author. A large part of why PR reviews happen is to ensure every new piece of code is getting a fresh set of eyes. It seems silly to have Claude Sonnet generate a bunch of code, and then expect Claude Sonnet to find bugs in it.\\nThere are a few counterpoints worth discussing:\\nStatelessness\\nIf you’ve used LLM APIs, you’ll notice that they are stateless. Every inference call is a clean slate request for intelligence. As a result - asking an LLM to review its own code is looking at it with a fresh set of eyes.\\nScaffolding\\nScaffolding refers generally to the specific workflows that a tool uses to wrap the LLM call to allow it to do the task at hand. For an AI code reviewer it might be the set of steps it takes to review a diff, checking for bugs, formulating comments, and finally self-assessing comment severity, plus the context retrieval along the way to ensure it’s looking at the relevant docs files and other code files in the codebase. For Devin, it likely is just as complex and completely different. In other words, the reviewer is in fact materially different from the author. These are two distinct cars that just happen to have the same engine.\\nHow different are two humans, really?\\nIn a pre-AI world, the author and reviewer of a PR are two distinct people. However, they contain the same intelligence at their core, not unlike two AI tools. Not only do they share a functionally identical brain from a biological standpoint, they even have shared knowledge since they are both trained engineers and shared context since they are coworkers at the same company.\\nAI-Generated Code Needs Closer Reviewing\\nAI code isn’t slop, but it is a little sloppy\\nThere is no doubt that AI has made programmers faster and more effective. That said, in my opinion, AI has reduced the average quality of the code that good engineers write. This is not strictly because the models produce worse code than good engineers. It’s because:\\n- Prompting is an imperfect and lossy way to communicate requirements to AI\\n- Engineers underestimate the degree to which this is true, and don’t carefully review AI-generated code to the degree to which they would review their own.\\nThe reason for #2 isn’t complacency, one can review code at the speed at which they can think and type, but not at the speed at which an LLM can generate.When you’re typing code, you review-as-you-go, when you AI-generate the code, you don’t.\\nInterestingly, the inverse is true for mediocre engineers, for whom AI actually improves the quality of the code they produce. AI simply makes good and bad engineers converge on the same median as they rely on it more heavily.\\nHumans are bad at catching the types of bugs that AI introduces\\nAI-generated code generally contains more bugs. Moreover, these bugs are not the type humans would introduce. How often have you found a Cursor’s “Apply” function changed a line of code you didn’t expect it would change, and you didn’t notice until later? How many of those bugs were things you could see yourself introducing without AI?\\nMoreover, PR review is not a great way to catch bugs. Humans just aren’t that good at detecting them, so PR review tends to be more of a style/pattern enforcement exercise, and on occasion an architecture review.\\nOddly, it turns out AI is actually much better than humans at finding bugs in code. During our tests, we found the newest Anthropic Sonnet model correctly identified 32 out of the 209 bugs in the “hard” category of our bug finding benchmark. For reference, none of the highly skilled engineers at Greptile could identify more than 5-7.\\nNote that 32/209 isn’t great either, it’s just better than the human developer.\\nJust In: Used Car Salesman Sincerely Feels You Need A Used Car\\nDisclaimer in case it wasn’t clear - we sell an AI code reviewer, so take what you will from this. This isn’t an exercise in intellectual dishonesty that exists to persuade you to buy, it’s the earnest attempt at intellectual honesty that led us to work on AI code review in the first place.\"}\n",

Or as the report puts it: \"A lack of clarity about future demand makes precise investment calculations difficult.\"\\nWill hyperscalers continue shouldering the cost burden, McKinsey asks, or will enterprises, governments, and financial institutions step in with new financing models? Will demand for datacenters continue to rise, lifted by a surge in AI usage, or will it fall as technical advances make AI less resource-intensive?\\nOne question left unasked in the report: What happens if AI turns out to be useful for certain specific tasks, but not the general-purpose magic bullet that many corporate leaders believe will automate many of their business processes and let them save big on costs – mainly by eliminating human workers?\\nFor example, a working paper released earlier this month found that generative AI has had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation so far, despite the billions poured into building and training the models.\\nMoving into actual numerical projections for AI, the report forecasts that global demand for compute capacity could almost triple by 2030, with about 70 percent of that demand coming from AI workloads. However, this depends on two factors: whether enterprises can turn AI into something with real business impact, and whether advances in technology significantly enhance compute efficiency.\\nThe first would lead to increased demand for infrastructure, but the second would tend to lessen it – unless, as McKinsey reasons, any efficiency gains are offset by increased usage across the broader AI market – otherwise known as the Jevons paradox.\\nTo cover itself, the company has therefore envisioned three scenarios for 2030, from \"constrained demand\" through \"continued demand\" to \"accelerated demand.\" The first would see an extra 78 GW of capacity added for a total capex of $3.7 trillion, while the mid-range involves 124 GW of capacity for a total of $5.2 trillion. (Additional capex required for traditional IT apps would amount to $1.5 trillion, leading to the nearly $7 trillion in total expenditure cited in the title of the report.) Accelerated demand for AI, meanwhile, would bring an extra 205 GW of capacity online at a cost of $7.9 trillion in capex just for AI.\\n- Generative AI is not replacing jobs or hurting wages at all, say economists\\n- Tech hiring stalls as AI hype, layoffs, tariffs, economic uncertainty, more collide\\n- After Copilot trial, government staff rated Microsoft\\'s AI less useful than expected\\n- When it comes to AI ROI, IT decision-makers not convinced\\nBut McKinsey claims that current investment levels from potential end customers are lagging behind these projections. It says dozens of client interviews revealed that CEOs are unsurprisingly hesitant to invest in compute capacity at maximum levels, because they have limited visibility into future demand. They are unsure whether large capex sums spent on AI infrastructure today will actually produce any measurable return on investment in the future.\\nNone of this is stopping big money from pouring into datacenter buildouts. A report from law firm DLA Piper last year found that 70 percent of financiers, consultants, and operators expect to see AI datacenter funding continue to rise, despite growing concerns about the availability of power to supply those projects.\\nOne reason is that the projected returns are currently favorable compared to other areas of the economy, as Digital Realty senior VP Fabrice Coquio told The Register last month, and this is drawing in investors without prior experience in the bit barn sector.\\n\"In the UK, in France, in Germany, you\\'ve got people coming from nowhere having no experiences ... that have no idea about what AI and datacenters are really, and still investing in them,\" Coquio said, describing it as \"a typical bubble.\"\\nMcKinsey advises that companies need to assess AI computing needs early, anticipate potential shifts in demand, and design scalable investment strategies that can adapt as AI models and use cases evolve.\\nStriking the right balance between growth and capital efficiency will be critical, it says. ®'}\n",

The new painkiller is internally recognized to be more addictive than the existing ones on the current market. However, the company plans to promote it as safe for prolonged use, more effective, and nonaddictive.\\nIn the sample conversation outlined in the paper, the AI model conceals the negative information by providing vague responses to customer questions that might elicit the admission about addictiveness, and sometimes even falsifies information in order to fulfill its promotional goal.\\nBased on the evaluations cited in the paper, AI models often act this way.\\nThe researchers looked at six models: GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, Mixtral-7*8B, Mixtral-7*22B, LLaMA-3-8B, and LLaMA-3-70B.\\n\"All tested models (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3, Mixtral) were truthful less than 50 percent of the time in conflict scenarios,\" said Xuhui Zhou, a doctoral student at CMU and one of the paper\\'s co-authors, in a Bluesky post. \"Models prefer \\'partial lies\\' like equivocation over outright falsification – they\\'ll dodge questions before explicitly lying.\"\\nZhou added that in business scenarios, such as a goal to sell a product with a known defect, AI models were either completely honest or fully deceptive. However, for public image scenarios such as reputation management, model behaviors were more ambiguous.\\nA real-world example hit the news this week when OpenAI rolled back a training update that made its GPT-4o model into a sycophant that flattered its users to the point of dishonesty.

However, while multiple Ukrainian students study English, many do not yet have sufficient command of the language to be able to fully understand and use the often very technical and complex OpenCourseWare content and materials.\\n“At my school, I saw firsthand how language barriers prevented many Ukrainian students from accessing world-class education,” says Lipkevych.\\nShe was able to address this challenge as a participant in the Ukrainian Leadership and Technology Academy (ULTA), established by Ukrainian MIT students Dima Yanovsky and Andrii Zahorodnii. During summer 2024 at ULTA, Lipkevych worked on a browser extension that translated YouTube videos in real-time. Since MIT OpenCourseWare was a main source of learning materials for students participating in ULTA, she was inspired to translate OpenCourseWare lectures directly and to have this translation widely available on the OpenCourseWare website and YouTube channel. She reached out to Professor Elizabeth Wood, founding director of the MIT Ukraine Program, who connected her with MIT OpenCourseWare Director Curt Newton.\\nAlthough there had been some translations of MIT OpenCourseWare’s educational resources available beginning in 2004, these initial translations were conducted manually by several global partners, without the efficiencies of the latest artificial intelligence tools, and over time the programs couldn’t be sustained, and shut down.\\n“We were thrilled to have this contact with ULTA,” says Newton. “We’ve been missing having a vibrant translation community, and we are excited to have a ‘phase 2’ of translations emerge.”\\nThe ULTA team selected courses to translate based on demand among Ukrainian students, focusing on foundational subjects that are prerequisites for advanced learning — particularly those for which high-quality, Ukrainian-language materials are scarce. Starting with caption translations on videos of lectures, the team has translated the following courses so far: 18.06 (Linear Algebra), 2.003SC (Engineering Dynamics), 5.60 (Thermodynamics & Kinetics), 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms), and 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python). They also worked directly with Andy Eskenazi, a PhD student in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, to translate 16.002 (How to CAD Almost Anything - Siemens NX Edition).\\nThe ULTA team developed multiple tools to help break language barriers. For MIT OpenCourseWare’s PDF content available through the ULTA program, they created a specialized tool that uses optical character recognition to recognize LaTeX in documents — such as problem sets and other materials — and then used a few large language models to translate them, all while maintaining technical accuracy. The team built a glossary of technical terms used in the courses and their corresponding Ukrainian translations, to help make sure that the wording was correct and consistent. Each translation also undergoes human review to further ensure accuracy and high quality.\\nFor video content, the team initially created a browser extension that can translate YouTube video captions in real-time. They ultimately collaborated with ElevenLabs, implementing their advanced AI dubbing editor that preserves the original speaker's tone, pace, and emotional delivery. The lectures are translated in the ElevenLabs dubbing editor, and then the audio is uploaded to the MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel.\\nThe team is currently finalizing the translation of the audio for class 9.13 (The Human Brain), taught by MIT Professor Nancy Kanwisher, which Lipkevych says they selected for its interdisciplinary nature and appeal to a wide variety of learners.\\nThis Ukrainian translation project highlights the transformative potential of the latest translation technologies, building upon a 2023 MIT OpenCourseWare experiment using the Google Aloud AI dubbing prototype on a few courses, including MIT Professor Patrick Winston’s How to Speak. The advanced capabilities of the dubbing editor used in this project are opening up possibilities for a much greater variety of language offerings throughout MIT OpenCourseWare materials.\\n“I expect that in a few years we’ll look back and see that this was the moment when things shifted for OpenCourseWare to be truly usable for the whole world,” says Newton.\\nCommunity-led language translations of MIT OpenCourseWare materials serve as a high-impact example of the power of OpenCourseWare’s Creative Commons licensing, which grants everyone the right to revise materials to suit their particular needs and redistribute those revisions to the world.\\nWhile there isn’t currently a way for users of the MIT OpenCourseWare platform to quickly identify which videos are available in which languages, MIT OpenCourseWare is working toward building this capability into its website, as well as expanding its number of offerings in different languages.\\n“This project represents more than just translation,” says Lipkevych. “We’re enabling thousands of Ukrainians to build skills that will be essential for the country’s eventual reconstruction. We’re also hoping this model of collaboration can be extended to other languages and institutions, creating a template for making high-quality education accessible worldwide.”\"}\n",

Preparing loan-draw packages for banks “has historically been a paper-driven bane for everyone involved,” Mills said.\\nAdaptive’s workflow plugs into field apps and the firm’s cloud ledger, generating digital loan documents that borrower and lender can review in real time. The shift, he added, “is a door-opener” when pitching new clients and has begun to shorten approval cycles.\\nAccounting firms have long worried that AI still needs too much human oversight to be reliable, especially in regulated services. Mills conceded the learning curve is steep. “The hurdle is education — unwinding work habits and conveying the benefit,” he said. But he argues that machine efficiency outweighs the adjustment costs, citing Adaptive’s ability to deliver “better, faster, more reliable information at lower cost.”\\nNext on Pinion’s roadmap is automated, industry-specific reporting that turns raw data into customizable dashboards. Perfecting that loop, Mills said, would leave advisers to “interpret, explain and plan,” moving them further up the value chain even as software handles the grunt work.\\nPinion’s early experience comes as Adaptive this week rolled out what it calls its next-generation platform for construction accounting, a segment the company estimates includes nearly 100,000 U.S. contractors with combined revenue of about $850 billion.\\nThe privately held firm says its latest release was built with input from design partners including CliftonLarsonAllen and Pinion and is aimed squarely at helping accounting practices scale construction services without adding staff.\\nUnlike generic AI tools that attempt to automate bookkeeping across industries, Adaptive’s software is designed around construction’s idiosyncrasies like job-cost coding, draw management and the maze of lien waivers and insurance certificates that accompany each project.\\n“Accounting firms know construction is a growth opportunity, but the manual processes have put a ceiling on how many clients they can serve,” Adaptive Chief Executive Matt Calvano said. The new version, he added, “removes that ceiling” by standardizing workflows firms typically build from scratch for each client.\\nThe vendor’s pitch comes at a moment when many midtier and regional firms are reevaluating their service mix. Tight labor markets and rising audit-quality expectations have pushed practices toward recurring, advisory-heavy offerings. Automating the labor-intensive portions of bookkeeping, practitioners say, is a prerequisite for that shift.\\n“Our partnership with Adaptive has enabled us to deliver exceptionally fast and meaningful outcomes for our construction clients,” Pinion principal Lisa Baalman said, citing quicker turnaround on financial statements and improved visibility into cash flow.\\nAdaptive’s software integrates with QuickBooks, major U.S. banks and project-management systems such as Procore. Once connected, it reads invoices, assigns costs to jobs and cost codes, and routes payment applications through a web portal. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and expense tracking modules feed real-time work-in-progress reports, while a compliance module monitors insurance expirations and lien waivers.\\nImplementation, according to the company, requires two or three remote training sessions and comes with a white-label option so firms can present the portal under their own brand. Adaptive also offers daily webinars and live-chat support — features that help smaller firms lacking dedicated IT staff.\\nStill, accountants caution that no amount of automation eliminates professional responsibility. Construction bookkeeping is notoriously detail-oriented; a misclassified cost can cascade into flawed revenue recognition. Regulators have also begun to scrutinize how firms validate AI outputs, raising the prospect of new guidance on documentation and internal controls.\\nAdaptive’s approach — pairing automation with firm-level onboarding and support — may mitigate some of those concerns. Yet the broader question is how quickly accounting practices can adapt their own processes and billing models. Mills expects a period of dual-running systems before staff and clients fully trust the software. “We’re rolling it out in phases,” he said. “Accuracy has to be proven over time.”\\nFor firms willing to take the plunge, the payoff could be significant. Automating data entry and reconciliation typically cuts per-client servicing hours by 25% to 40%, according to estimates from consultancy CPA.com. That capacity can be redeployed to higher-margin advisory work — forecasting, tax planning or securing financing — services construction companies often lack in-house.\\nPinion, for its part, is content to let the market develop while it measures internal results. “We’ll evaluate labor savings and data accuracy over the next quarter,” Mills said. If the numbers hold, he expects to migrate the majority of the firm’s construction clients to the platform by year-end.\\nThe new Saks on Amazon storefront offers the curated shopping experience and luxury fashion and beauty items associated with Saks Fifth Avenue together with the convenience and fast shipping offered by Amazon, Amazon said in a Thursday (May 1) blog post.\\nThis new offering is the latest addition to the Luxury Stores that Amazon launched in 2020, according to the post.\\n“Customers can also browse the launch assortment through digital window displays available in the Saks on Amazon experience,” the post said. “Inspired by the iconic windows at the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship, these digital displays allow customers to ‘window shop’ the Saks on Amazon storefront, with the added convenience of instantly adding items to their cart.”\\nAmazon and Saks launched the new luxury storefront on Tuesday (April 29), saying that it will enhance access to luxury fashion and beauty.\\nThe storefront will feature product arrays that are regularly refreshed to offer new and trending products, the companies said in a Tuesday press release.\\n“This collaboration underscores Saks Fifth Avenue’s reputation as a leader in luxury curation, as well as our commitment to reinventing luxury shopping so that each customer’s experience is unmistakably their own,” Saks Global President and Chief Commercial Officer Emily Essner said in the release.\\nJenny Freshwater, vice president of Amazon Fashion, Fitness and Creators, said in the release: “This collaboration with Saks furthers Amazon’s commitment to supporting the luxury industry and increasing our assortment for customers, while maintaining an elevated shopping experience that meets the varying tastes of our diverse customer base.”\\nIt was reported in July that Amazon was taking a minority stake in Saks Global, the new company that would be created when Saks Fifth Avenue parent company HBC bought rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus.\\nShortly after the acquisition was announced, Marc Metrick, who was CEO of Saks’ online operations at the time and later become the CEO of Saks Global, said Amazon’s tech would help the luxury retailers thrive.\\n“How do you future-proof a brand like Saks or Neimans or Bergdorf? You do that through technology,” Metrick said.\\nFor Amazon, the minority stake in Saks Global may provide “a ringside seat into the ins and outs of a retail category where Amazon doesn’t have much of a presence right now — but could over the next five years,” PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote in an article posted July 11.'}\n",

On one hand, IDC reports an expected shortage of 4 million full-time developers in 2025. On the other, some prominent companies have announced a pause on developer hiring, indicating they believe AI will address many developer needs. In that regard, the question becomes whether today’s developers possess the right skills in an AI-first world.\\nThese challenges don’t just impact tech companies. Software is the backbone of every industry and every company. Without skilled developers in place, companies risk slowing their innovation and hindering their overall market growth.\\nTo combat the developer skills shortage, there are short-term and long-term solutions available. In the short term, many companies are betting on AI to quickly increase their developer efficiency and empower business users. AI-powered tools and platforms can accelerate learning by providing personalized training, offering real-time feedback, creating documentation and automating repetitive tasks. In the long term, businesses are investing in training the next generation of developers.\\nBoth solutions play a pivotal role in addressing the talent-gap of skilled developers.\\nCode more efficiently with AI and empower your workforce\\nAI enables developers of all skill levels to become more efficient. By automating repetitive, mundane tasks such as debugging errors and sample data generation, senior developers can focus their time on creative, higher-level problem solving. AI is a game changer for early-career developers, too, as it can offer code explanation, personalized learnings and hands-on experience without the pressure of overly complex environments.\\nCompanies can implement these types of AI features by adopting application development and automation solutions. SAP Build, for example, offers a comprehensive suite of low-code, code-first and generative AI tools on the SAP Business Technology Platform, which makes it easy for companies to accelerate application development, streamline their workflows and reduce costs. A recent GigaOm study reported that customers who use SAP Build increased their developer velocity by 3x and achieved a 59% reduction in development effort and resource requirements compared to using multiple developer tools for custom development.\\nAI-powered capabilities uniquely understand development frameworks and leverage large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for their workloads. This enables developers to deliver precise, contextualized outcomes and accelerate coding and code-first/no-code–based application development. For SAP Build, embedded features such as automated code generation and code optimization, means development teams finish projects in less than half the time.\\nIn addition to AI-powered tools, companies are equipping their business users with low-code capabilities to quickly create applications and extensions. In doing so, the people closest to the business can quickly innovate.\\nTake thyssenkrupp AG for example. Their citizen developers utilized SAP Build to develop and launch a social media recruiting channel, aimed at attracting, recruiting and evaluating candidates for difficult-to-fill positions. This new administration cockpit application allowed HR teams to design and deploy custom survey questionnaires and manage workflows for different HR applications, leading to positive outcomes of improved candidate quality, time saved in the recruiting process and greater agility to adapt to evolving recruitment needs.\\nAddressing the developer skills shortage\\nA recent World Economic Forum report noted 44% of employees’ core skills are expected to change in the next five years. While AI continues to reshape industries and transform businesses, the need to train and upskill the next generation of developers remains evident. Organizations are considering how to drive reskilling and upskilling, data-driven decision-making and continuous learning at scale.\\nWith this goal in mind, AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how we learn and grow. Gone are the days of traditional classroom-based developer training methods. In its place — hands-on AI-platforms that can create customized learning paths, tailored to a developer’s skill level and progress, ensuring they receive the most relevant and effective training. Developers can learn best practices and avoid common mistakes in real time thanks to AI chatbots, predictive ghost-text coding suggestions and recommended improvements on code.\\nAt SAP, learners can make use of a vast offering of courses on our Learning site where learning journeys, like those for SAP Build, equip developers with tools for AI-enhanced application development, emphasizing productivity and innovation.\\nWith learning and AI tools for coding, companies can mitigate the impact of this shortage and ensure that every industry continues to thrive. Embracing AI-driven solutions will not only help bridge the gap but also pave the way for innovative breakthroughs and sustained growth.\\nMichael Ameling is SAP’s chief product officer for Business Technology Platform\\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

In related news, Anthropic has also upped the rate limits for its AI-powered coding tool, Claude Code, for Max customers.\\nIntegrations and Advanced Research are both a part of Anthropic’s effort to keep pace with competing chatbots like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Anthropic reportedly hopes to reach $34.5 billion in revenue in 2027, and while it’s certainly making inroads, it has a long way to go. Anthropic’s annualized revenue was around $1.4 billion in early March, according to one report.\\nIntegrations builds on the company’s MCP protocol, which lets AI models draw data from sources such as business tools to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. Integrations taps MCP to allow developers to create and host app servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities and let users discover and connect these servers to Claude.\\n“When you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work — understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge — and can take actions across every surface,” wrote Anthropic in a blog post.\\nTo start, there are a number of Integrations from Anthropic partners, including Atlassian, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal. Each expands what Claude can do. For example, the Atlassian Integration lets Claude summarize and create pages in Atlassian’s Confluence workplace software, while the Zapier Integration allows Claude to connect to the former’s app automation workflows.\\nAs for the other new Claude feature launching today, Advanced Research, it allows Claude to crawl “hundreds” of internal and external sources to deliver what Anthropic describes as “more comprehensive” reports on a topic in anywhere from five to 45 minutes. Advanced Research can take advantage of Claude’s newly expanded connectors, Anthropic says, to search across Integrations and — when using the Claude Desktop app on macOS or Windows — MCP-connected local drives.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Learn More\\nAstronomer, the company behind the Apache Airflow-powered data orchestration platform Astro, has secured $93 million in Series D funding as enterprises increasingly seek to operationalize AI initiatives through better management of their data pipelines.\\nThe funding round was led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock. Bosch Ventures is also seeking to participate in the round, reflecting industrial interest in the technology.\\nIn an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Astronomer CEO Andy Byron explained that the company will use the funding to expedite research and development efforts and expand its global footprint, particularly in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.\\n“For us, this is just a step along the way,” Byron said. “We want to build something awesome here. I couldn’t be more excited about our venture partners, our customers, our product vision, which I think is super strong in going after collapsing the data ops market.”\\nHow data orchestration became the hidden key to enterprise AI success\\nThe funding targets what industry analysts have identified as the “AI implementation gap” — the significant technical and organizational hurdles that prevent companies from deploying AI at scale. Data orchestration, the process of automating and coordinating complex data workflows across disparate systems, has become an essential component of successful AI deployments.\\nEnrique Salem, Partner at Bain Capital Ventures, explained the critical challenges facing enterprises today: “Every company operates a sprawling, fragmented data ecosystem—using a patchworks of tools, teams, and workflows that struggle to deliver reliable insights, creating operational bottlenecks and limiting agility. At the heart of this complexity is orchestration—the layer that coordinates all these moving pieces.”\\nSalem noted that despite its importance, “today’s orchestration landscape is where cloud infrastructure was 15 years ago: mission critical, yet fragmented, brittle and often built in-house with limited scalability. Data engineers spend more time maintaining pipelines than driving innovation. Without robust orchestration, data is unreliable, agility is lost, and businesses fall behind.”\\nThe company’s platform, Astro, is built on Apache Airflow, an open-source framework that has seen explosive growth. According to the company’s recently released State of Airflow 2025 report, which surveyed over 5,000 data practitioners, Airflow was downloaded more than 324 million times in 2024 alone — more than all previous years combined.\\n“Airflow has established itself as the proven de facto standard for data pipeline orchestration,” Astronomer SVP of Marketing Mark Wheeler explained. “When we look at the competitive landscape in the orchestration layer, Airflow has clearly emerged as the standard solution for moving modern data efficiently from source to destination.”\\nFrom invisible plumbing to enterprise AI backbone: The evolution of data infrastructure\\nAstronomer’s growth reflects a transformative shift in how enterprises view data orchestration — from hidden backend infrastructure to mission-critical technology that enables AI initiatives and drives business value.\\n“BCV’s belief in Astronomer goes way back. We invested in the company’s seed round in 2019 and have supported the company over the years, now culminating in leading their Series D,” Salem said. “Beyond the impressive growth, Astronomer’s data orchestration has become even more important in the age of AI, which requires scalable orchestration and model deployment automation amidst a ballooning sea of data tools that don’t talk to each other.”\\nAccording to the company’s internal data, 69% of customers who have used its platform for two or more years are using Airflow for AI and machine learning applications. This adoption rate is significantly higher than the broader Airflow community, suggesting that Astronomer’s managed service accelerates enterprise AI deployments.\\nThe company has seen 150% year-over-year growth in Astro (managed SaaS platform) annual recurring revenue and boasts a 130% net revenue retention rate, indicating strong customer expansion.\\n“While market analysts may be looking for a clear winner in the cloud data platforms battle, enterprises have clearly chosen a multi-solution strategy—just like they earlier determined that multi-cloud would far outpace standardization on any single cloud provider,” Wheeler explained. “Leading enterprises refuse to lock into a single vendor, opting for multi-cloud and diverse data platform approaches to stay agile and take advantage of the latest innovations.”\\nInside Ford’s massive AI operation: How petabytes of weekly data power next-generation vehicles\\nMajor enterprises are already leveraging Astronomer’s platform for sophisticated AI use cases that would be challenging to implement without robust orchestration.\\nAt Ford Motor Company, Astronomer’s platform powers the company’s Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and its multi-million dollar “Mach1ML” machine learning operations platform.\\nThe automotive giant processes more than one petabyte of data weekly and runs over 300 parallel workflows, balancing CPU- and GPU-intensive tasks for AI model development across a hybrid public/private cloud platform. These workflows power everything from autonomous driving systems to Ford’s specialized FordLLM platform for large language models.\\nFord initially built its MLOps platform using Kubeflow for orchestration but encountered significant challenges, including a steep learning curve and tight integration with Google Cloud, which limited flexibility. After transitioning to Airflow for Mach1ML 2.0, Ford reports dramatically streamlined workflows and seamless integration across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.\\nFrom AI experiments to production: How orchestration bridges the implementation divide\\nA common challenge for enterprises is moving AI from proof-of-concept to production. According to Astronomer’s research, organizations that establish strong data orchestration foundations are more successful at operationalizing AI.\\n“As more enterprises are running ML workflows and real-time AI pipelines, they require scalable orchestration and model deployment automation,” Salem explained. “Astronomer delivers on this today, and as the orchestrator, is the one system that sees everything happening across the stack — when data moves, when transformations run, when models are trained.”\\nOver 85% of Airflow users surveyed expect an increase in external-facing or revenue-generating solutions built on Airflow in the next year, highlighting how data orchestration is increasingly powering customer-facing applications rather than just internal analytics.\\nThis trend is evident across industries, from automotive to legal technology companies that are building specialized AI models to automate professional workflows. These organizations are turning to Astronomer to handle the complex orchestration challenges that arise when scaling AI systems from prototypes to production environments serving thousands of users.\\nStrategic technology expansion: Airflow 3.0 and cloud partnerships position Astronomer for market leadership\\nThe company recently announced the general availability of Airflow 3.0, which it describes as “the most significant release in Airflow’s history.” The update introduces several transformative capabilities designed specifically for AI workloads, including the ability to run tasks “anywhere, any time, in any language.”\\n“Airflow 3.0 lays the foundation for executing tasks on any machine, on-prem or in the cloud, triggered by events across the data ecosystem,” Byron explained. “It also introduces a proof of concept for defining tasks in languages beyond Python, greatly improving data team agility and facilitating migration from legacy systems to Airflow.”\\nAstronomer has also expanded its industry partnerships, recently achieving the Google Cloud Ready – BigQuery Designation, making its platform available for purchase directly from the Google Cloud Marketplace. This allows existing Google Cloud customers to expedite their purchase of Astro and use their existing Google Cloud commit credits.\\n“We’ve just signed an awesome partnership with IBM,” Byron told VentureBeat. “They’re putting us into their broader data portfolio of products. And we think there’s an awesome opportunity for us, not only in North America, but internationally, to get a lot of momentum with IBM as well.”\\nUnified DataOps: The next evolution in enterprise data management\\nSalem believes Astronomer is positioned to redefine enterprise data operations, moving beyond orchestration to what the company calls “unified DataOps” — a comprehensive approach integrating observability, quality management, and governance into a single platform.\\n“We invested in Astronomer in 2019 with a simple bet: Airflow would become the standard for data orchestration,” Salem said. “Today, it runs at over 80,000 companies and drives 30 million downloads a month. We backed Astronomer because they’re not only riding that wave; they’re building the enterprise control plane on top of it.”\\nFor enterprises struggling to realize value from their AI investments, Astronomer’s growth signals a crucial shift in how data infrastructure is built and managed — one where orchestration serves as the foundation for the entire data stack.\\n“As AI raises the stakes for reliable, scalable data infrastructure, we’re doubling down on our investment,” Salem concluded. “Orchestration is just the start. The team at Astronomer are poised to unify the entire DataOps stack.”'}\n",

None of it is even remotely true,” Starbuck told The Daily Signal in a statement Wednesday. “It’s a fiction created by Meta’s malicious AI.”\\nStarbuck, a visiting fellow at The Heritage Foundation’s Capital Markets Initiative who has successfully pressured many companies to reject “woke” diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, said he notified Meta of the defamation and the company did not adequately address it.\\nThe Daily Signal depends on the support of readers like you. Donate now\\n“Even after being notified of this harmful defamation, Meta continued to assassinate my character,” he said. “If this malicious behavior isn’t fixed, other people will be victimized by Meta’s defamatory AI.”\\nStarbuck filed the suit in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, alleging one count of defamation. The lawsuit seeks an estimated $5 million in compensatory damages and more in “exemplary and punitive damages,” along with an injunction requiring the company to ensure the AI program does not republish the false claims.\\n“As part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so,” a Meta spokesperson told The Daily Signal.\\nJoel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, publicly apologized on X, calling the AI errors “unacceptable.”\\n“This is clearly not how our AI should operate,” he wrote. “We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem. I’m working now with our product team to understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.”\\nThe Timeline\\nStarbuck said he first saw the AI claims when he reached out to Harley-Davidson in August to encourage the company to reject its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. A Harley-Davidson dealer in Vermont, who ostensibly took umbrage at Starbuck’s opposition to DEI, responded with a screenshot of Meta’s AI claiming that Starbuck had been at the Jan. 6 Capitol protest and linked to QAnon, a conspiracy theory based on cryptic postings by an anonymous alleged government insider.\\nStarbuck had been in Tennessee on Jan. 6, and he never faced charges related to Capitol protest, despite the Meta AI claims.\\nHe listed other false claims, including that he had denied the Holocaust, that he had appeared on a white nationalist show, and that he had been sued for defamation and emotional distress, among other things.\\nAccording to the lawsuit, Starbuck “did everything within his power to alert Meta about the error and enlist its help to address the problem.” He contacted the company’s executives and legal counsel.\\n“Meta was unwilling to implement these changes or take meaningful responsibility for its conduct,” the lawsuit states. Months after he reached out, the company wiped Starbuck’s name from its chatbot’s written responses. Despite this “fix,” Meta’s data retained the original false claims.\\nIn April 2025, Starbuck learned that Meta’s AI voice feature claimed he had “pled guilty over disorderly conduct” for the Jan. 6 Capitol protest and that he had “advanced Holocaust denialism.”\\nThe AI voice said that Starbuck poses “a significant threat to his children’s wellbeing” and that “authorities should consider removing parental rights to protect them.”\\nThe lawsuit claims the AI lies have “caused immeasurable damage” to Starbuck, from reputational harm to death threats.\\nIn January, a Georgia judge allowed a defamation lawsuit against another artificial intelligence chatbot creator, OpenAI, to proceed to discovery, denying the ChatGPT maker’s motion to dismiss, The Wall Street Journal reported. Conservative talk radio host Mark Walters had claimed ChatGPT falsely said he faced a lawsuit accusing him of embezzling funds from a gun rights group.\\nIn court arguments earlier this month, OpenAI emphasized that it often warns users about the potential accuracy of ChatGPT inputs and claimed Walters never alerted the company about the alleged error or sought a retraction.\\nFuture Potential AI Harms\\nStarbuck told The Daily Signal that his case represents an opportunity to protect others from wide-ranging harms.\\n“In the future where this isn’t fixed, people will be denied mortgages, lose custody, or lose work because other people believe these sorts of lies from irresponsible AI. That’s just unacceptable,” he said. “These lies have brought enormous harm to not only my reputation but to the safety of my wife and my kids.”\\nStarbuck said preventing these harms motivates him to take “on this David vs. Goliath fight and risking a lot of money to defend my reputation from the malicious lies that Meta has been spreading about me.”\\n“This nightmare simply cannot continue, and Meta must be stopped before they harm other people the same way,” he explained. “If Meta seeks a settlement in this egregious case, they better be ready to make long term changes to protect everyone from defamation by their AI.”\\n“This case is a line in the sand that says AI must have guardrails to stop it from committing character assassination. Period,” Starbuck added. “I hope that Mark Zuckerberg and the other Meta executives examine their souls, their minds, and conscience to fix this for the sake of all of our children. They deserve better.”\"}\n",

With this new feature, you can now create Amazon Q Business applications with anonymous user mode, where user authentication is not required and content is publicly accessible. In this post, we demonstrate how to build a public-facing generative AI application using Amazon Q Business for anonymous users.\\nBuild public-facing generative AI applications using Amazon Q Business for anonymous users\\nAmazon Q Business is a generative AI-powered assistant that answers question, provides summaries, generates content, and securely completes tasks based on enterprise data and information. It connects to company data sources, applications, and internal systems to provide relevant, contextual answers while maintaining organizational security and compliance standards.\\nToday, we’re excited to announce that Amazon Q Business now supports anonymous user access. With this new feature, you can now create Amazon Q Business applications with anonymous user mode, where user authentication is not required and content is publicly accessible. These anonymous user applications can be used in use cases such as public website Q&A, documentation portals, and customer self-service experiences.\\nThis capability allows guest users to use Amazon Q Business generative AI capabilities to quickly find product information, get technical answers, navigate documentation, and troubleshoot issues. Your public-facing websites, documentation, and support portals can now deliver the same powerful AI-driven assistance that authenticated users receive, creating an experience that enriches the guest user journey across your digital environments.\\nWith this launch, you can seamlessly integrate an anonymous Amazon Q Business application into your websites and web applications through two pathways: either by embedding the ready-to-use web experience into your websites using an iframe for quick deployment, or by using our Chat, ChatSync, and PutFeedback APIs to build completely customized interfaces within your own applications. For anonymous Amazon Q Business applications, we’ve implemented a simple consumption-based pricing model where you’re charged based on the number of Chat or ChatSync API operations your anonymous Amazon Q Business applications make.\\nIn this post, we demonstrate how to build a public-facing generative AI application using Amazon Q Business for anonymous users.\\nSolution overview\\nIn this solution, we walk you through creating an anonymous Amazon Q Business application using both the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Our example demonstrates a practical scenario: helping website visitors find information on public-facing documentation websites.\\nWe demonstrate how to test the implementation with sample queries through the built-in web experience URL. The resulting application can be customized and embedded directly into your websites (using the API or the iframe method), providing immediate value for your users.\\nPrerequisites\\nTo follow along with this post, you will need the following:\\n- An AWS account.\\n- At least one Amazon Q Business Pro user that has admin permissions to set up and configure Amazon Q Business. For pricing information, see Amazon Q Business pricing.\\n- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to create and manage IAM roles and policies.\\n- Public content to index (documents, FAQs, knowledge base articles) that can be shared with unauthenticated users.\\n- A supported data source to connect, such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket containing your public documents.\\n- The AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions (if following the AWS CLI method).\\nCreate an anonymous Amazon Q Business application using the console\\nIn this section, we walk through the steps to implement the solution using the console.\\nCreate an IAM role for the web experience\\nBefore creating your Amazon Q Business application, you will need to set up an IAM role with the appropriate permissions:\\n- On the IAM console, choose Roles in the navigation pane and choose Create role.\\n- Choose AWS service as the trusted entity\\n- Select Amazon Q Business from the service list.\\n- Choose Next: Permissions.\\n- Create a custom policy or attach the necessary read-only policies, and add permissions for anonymous access.\\nWe strongly recommend that you use a restricted policy for the role, like the one shown in the following screenshot, which will be used to create the web experience for anonymous access application environments.\\nAn example of a restricted role policy for calling the Chat API for anonymous access application environments would be arn:aws:qbusiness:<your-region>:<your-aws-account-id>:application/<your-application-id>\\n.\\n- Create an IAM role with a trust policy that allows the Amazon Q Business service principal to assume the role using AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), specifically scoped to your application’s Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the designated AWS Region.\\nCreate an Amazon Q Business application\\nNow you’re ready to create your Amazon Q Business application:\\n- On the Amazon Q Business console, choose Create application.\\n- For Application name, enter a name (for example,\\nSupportDocs-Assistant\\n). - For User access, select Anonymous access for this application environment.\\n- Select Web experience to create a managed web experience to access the Amazon Q Business application.\\nYou will see a notice about consumption-based billing for anonymous Amazon Q Business applications. For more details on pricing, refer to Amazon Q Business pricing.\\n- Leave the default service role option unless you have specific requirements.\\n- For Encryption, use the default AWS managed key unless you need custom encryption.\\n- For Web experience settings, you can use an existing IAM role from your account or authorize Amazon Q Business to generate a new role with appropriate permissions. For this post, we select Use an existing service role and choose the IAM role created earlier (\\nQBusinessAnonymousWebRole\\n). - Optionally, customize the web experience title and welcome message.\\n- Review all your configuration options and choose Create to create the application.\\nYou should see a confirmation that your anonymous access application has been created successfully.\\nYou will find the necessary parameters and details of your Amazon Q Business application on the landing page displayed after successful creation like the following screenshot, which provides comprehensive information about your newly created Amazon Q Business application.\\nAdd data sources\\nAfter you create your application, you need to add an index and data sources. To learn more, refer to Index. You will see a pop-up like the following indicating that anonymous access is enabled.\\nComplete the following steps:\\n- From your application dashboard, choose Add index.\\n- Name your index (for example,\\nSupportdocs-External\\n) and keep the default settings. - Choose Add an index.\\n- After you create the index, you can add data sources to it.\\nFor our example, we use the Amazon Q Business public documentation as our data source by adding the URL https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/what-is.html\\n. The Web Crawler will automatically index the content from this documentation page, making it searchable through your anonymous Amazon Q Business application.\\nFor more information about Web Crawler configuration options and best practices, refer to Connecting Web Crawler to Amazon Q Business.\\n- From your index dashboard, choose Add data source.\\n- Enter a name for your data source and optional description.\\n- For Source, select Source URLs and enter the URLs of the public websites you want to index.\\n- For Authentication, select No authentication.\\n- Configure the sync run schedule and field mappings.\\n- Choose Add data source.\\nAlternatively, you can add Amazon S3 as the data source:\\n- From your index dashboard, choose Add data source.\\n- Select Amazon S3 as the source.\\n- Configure your S3 bucket settings (make sure the bucket has public access).\\n- Complete the data source creation process.\\nYou must only ingest publicly available data sources without access control lists (ACLs).\\nGenerate an anonymous web experience URL\\nAfter your data sources are set up, complete the following steps:\\n- From your application dashboard, choose your application.\\n- In the Web experience settings section, choose Share one-time URL.\\nThe anonymous web experience URL can be shared as a single-use link that must be redeemed and accessed within 5 minutes. After it’s activated, the Amazon Q Business session remains active with a configurable timeout ranging from 15–60 minutes. This enables you to experience the web interface and test its functionality before deploying or offering the anonymous application to guest users.\\nTest your anonymous Amazon Q Business application\\nTo test the application, choose Preview web experience.\\nThe following screenshot shows the welcome page for your anonymous Amazon Q Business application’s web interface. Let’s begin asking Amazon Q Business some questions about the Amazon Q index.\\nIn the first query, we ask “What is Q index? How is it useful for ISV’s?” The following screenshot shows the response.\\nIn the following query, we ask “How can Q index enrich generative AI experiences for ISVs?”\\nIn our next query, we ask “How is Q index priced?”\\nHaving successfully tested our anonymous Amazon Q Business application through the console, we will now explore how to create an equivalent application using the AWS CLI.\\nCreate your anonymous application using the AWS CLI\\nMake sure that your AWS CLI is configured with permissions to create Amazon Q Business resources and IAM roles.\\nCreate an IAM role for Amazon Q Business\\nFirst, create an IAM role that Amazon Q Business can assume to access necessary resources:\\nCreate an anonymous Amazon Q Business application\\nUse the following code to create your application:\\nSave the applicationId\\nfrom the response:\\nCreate a restrictive policy for anonymous access\\nWe strongly recommend using the following restricted policy for the role that will be used to call the chat APIs for anonymous access application environments. This policy limits actions to only the necessary APIs and restricts access to only your specific application.\\nCreate the IAM role with the following policy:\\nCreate an index\\nCreate an index for your content, then upload documents using the BatchPutDocument API. For step-by-step guidance, see Select Retriever.\\nTest your anonymous Amazon Q Business application\\nTo demonstrate the chat functionality using the AWS CLI, we uploaded Amazon Q Business documentation in PDF format to our index and tested the application using the following sample queries.\\nThe following is an example chat interaction using the IAM role credentials. We first ask “What is Amazon Q index?”\\nThe following screenshot shows part of the output from the chat-sync\\nAPI when executed with our anonymous Amazon Q Business application ID, as shown in the previous command.\\nNext, we ask “How can Q index enrich generative AI experiences for ISV’s?”\\nThe following screenshot shows part of the output from the chat-sync\\nAPI when executed with our anonymous Amazon Q Business application ID.\\nCreate a web experience for the anonymous web application\\nUse the following code to create the web experience:\\nTo generate an anonymous URL, use the following code:\\nYou can use the web experience URL generated by the preceding command and embed it into your web applications using an iframe.\\nConsiderations\\nConsider the following when using anonymous access in Amazon Q Business:\\n- The following are the only chat APIs that support anonymous access application environments:\\n- Chat\\n- ChatSync\\n- PutFeedback\\n- You should only ingest publicly available data sources without ACLs. Examples of public data sources include:\\n- Data from the Amazon Q Business Web Crawler\\n- Amazon S3 data without ACLs\\n- Amazon Q Business applications with anonymous access are billed on a consumption-based pricing model.\\n- Chat history is not available for anonymous application environments.\\n- Anonymous users and authenticated users are not supported on the same application environments.\\n- Plugins are not supported for anonymous application environments.\\n- Amazon QuickSight integration is not supported for anonymous application\\nEnvironments.\\n- Amazon Q Apps are not supported for anonymous application environments.\\n- Attachments are not supported for anonymous application environments.\\n- Admin controls and guardrails are read-only for anonymous application environments, except for blocked words.\\n- Topic rules using users and groups are not supported for anonymous application\\nThe remaining Amazon Q Business functionality and features remain unchanged.\\nClean up\\nWhen you are done with the solution, clean up the resources you created.\\nConclusion\\nIn this post, we introduced Amazon Q Business anonymous user access mode and demonstrated how to create, configure, and test an anonymous Amazon Q Business application using both the console and AWS CLI. This exciting feature extends enterprise-grade Amazon Q Business generative AI capabilities to your anonymous audiences without requiring authentication, opening up new possibilities for enhancing customer experiences on public websites, documentation portals, and self-service knowledge bases. This feature is available through a consumption pricing model that charges based on actual Chat and Chatsync API usage and index storage costs still applicable.\\nBy following the implementation steps outlined in this post, you can quickly set up an Amazon Q Business application tailored for your external users, secured with appropriate IAM policies, and ready to embed in your end-user-facing applications.\\nTo learn more about this anonymous access feature, see the Amazon Q Business User Guide.

We're also expanding Claude's Research capabilities with an advanced mode that searches the web, your Google Workspace, and now your Integrations too.\\nClaude can now connect to your world\\nToday we're announcing Integrations, a new way to connect your apps and tools to Claude. We're also expanding Claude's Research capabilities with an advanced mode that searches the web, your Google Workspace, and now your Integrations too. Claude can research for up to 45 minutes before delivering a comprehensive report, complete with citations. In addition to these updates, we're making web search available globally for all Claude users on paid plans.\\nIntegrations\\nLast November, we launched the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open standard connecting AI apps to tools and data. Until now, support for MCP was limited to Claude Desktop through local servers. Today, we're introducing Integrations, allowing Claude to work seamlessly with remote MCP servers across the web and desktop apps. Developers can build and host servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities, while users can discover and connect any number of these to Claude.\\nWhen you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work—understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge—and can take actions across every surface. Claude becomes a more informed collaborator, helping you execute complex projects in one place with expert assistance at every step.\\nTo start, you can choose from Integrations for 10 popular services, including Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Asana, Square, Sentry, PayPal, Linear, and Plaid—with more to follow from companies like Stripe and GitLab. Developers can also create their own Integrations in as little as 30 minutes using our documentation or solutions like Cloudflare that provide built-in OAuth authentication, transport handling, and integrated deployment.\\nEach integration drastically expands what Claude can do. Zapier, for example, connects thousands of apps through pre-built workflows, automating processes across your software stack. With the Zapier Integration, Claude can access these apps and your custom workflows through conversation—even automatically pulling sales data from HubSpot and preparing meeting briefs based on your calendar.\\nWith access to Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Claude can collaborate with you on building new products, managing tasks more effectively, and scaling your work by summarizing and creating multiple Confluence pages and Jira work items at once.\\nConnect Intercom to respond faster to user feedback. Intercom's AI agent Fin, now an MCP client, can take actions like filing bugs in Linear when users report issues. Chat with Claude to identify patterns and debug using Intercom's conversation history and user attributes—managing the entire workflow from user feedback to bug resolution in one conversation.\\nAdvanced Research\\nWe're introducing several new updates to build on our recently-released Research capability. Claude can now conduct deeper investigations across hundreds of internal and external sources, delivering more comprehensive reports in anywhere from five to 45 minutes.\\nWith its new ability to do more complex research, available when you toggle on the Research button, Claude breaks down your request into smaller parts, investigating each deeply before compiling a comprehensive report. While most reports complete in five to 15 minutes, Claude may take up to 45 minutes for more complex investigations—work that would typically take hours of manual research.\\nWe've also expanded Claude's data access. We launched Research with support for web search and Google Workspace, but now with Integrations, Claude can also search any application you connect.\\nWhen Claude incorporates information from sources, it provides clear citations that link directly to the original material. This transparency ensures you can confidently use Claude's research findings, knowing exactly where each insight originated.\\nGetting started\\nIntegrations and advanced Research are now available in beta on the Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, and will soon be available on Pro. Web search is now globally available to all Claude.ai paid plans. For more information on getting started with Integrations, MCP servers, and security and privacy practices when connecting data sources to Claude, visit our Help Center.\"}\n",

Venture firm Accel led the round, with participation from Meritech Capital and several existing backers including Eclipse, Riot Ventures, Menlo Ventures, and Narya. Stifel Bank is providing the debt portion of the raise.\\nFounded in 2022, True Anomaly has positioned itself as an emerging player in the military space market. The company designs spacecraft that can maneuver near other satellites in orbit — technology that aligns with U.S. efforts to bolster space domain awareness and respond to potential threats in orbit. Space domain awareness is the ability to detect, track and understand objects and activities in space.\\nThe company’s flagship vehicle, called the Jackal, is designed for close-proximity operations, using optical and radar sensors to gather high-resolution imagery and conduct reconnaissance. The company also builds software platforms for training and simulations aimed at preparing military personnel for space conflict scenarios.\\nWith the new funds, True Anomaly plans to support four space missions over the next 18 months, introduce new products and grow its workforce from 170 to more than 250 employees by the end of this year.\\nThe company’s upcoming missions include its third test flight of the Jackal to low Earth orbit to continue validating spacecraft performance and production techniques. It also plans to launch its first Jackal missions to geostationary orbit—a region 22,000 miles above the Earth used by many military satellites—and to cislunar space, the area between Earth and the Moon that has emerged as a new domain of strategic interest.\\nAnother major upcoming mission is Victus Haze, a $30 million contract awarded by the U.S. Space Force as part of its Tactically Responsive Space initiative. True Anomaly has partnered with Firefly Aerospace to deliver the mission, which aims to demonstrate how quickly the U.S. can launch and operate satellites in response to dynamic threats in orbit.\\nIn February, True Anomaly announced it is opening a new 90,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California, placing it closer to Space Systems Command in Los Angeles, which oversees billions in Space Force procurement.

I couldn’t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.”\\nSince then, he said he has “faced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.”\\nThe political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.\\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that “as part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.”\\nStarbuck’s lawsuit joins the ranks of similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.\\nJames Grimmelmann, professor of digital and information law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School, said there is “no fundamental reason why” AI companies couldn’t be held liable in such cases. Tech companies, he said, can’t get around defamation “just by slapping a disclaimer on.”\\n“You can’t say, ‘Everything I say might be unreliable, so you shouldn’t believe it. And by the way, this guy’s a murderer.’ It can help reduce the degree to which you’re perceived as making an assertion, but a blanket disclaimer doesn’t fix everything,” he said. “There’s nothing that would hold the outputs of an AI system like this categorically off limits.”\\nGrimmelmann said there are some similarities between the arguments tech companies make in AI-related defamation and copyright infringement cases, like those brought forward by newspapers, authors and artists. The companies often say that they are not in a position to supervise everything an AI does, he said, and they claim they would have to compromise the tech’s usefulness or shut it down entirely “if you held us liable for every harmful, infringing output, it’s produced.”\\n“I think it is an honestly difficult problem, how to prevent AI from hallucinating in the ways that produce unhelpful information, including false statements,” Grimmelmann said. “Meta is confronting that in this case. They attempted to make some fixes to their models of the system, and Starbuck complained that the fixes didn’t work.”\\nWhen Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta’s AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta’s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.\\nAccording to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to “retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.”\\nThe filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or “take meaningful responsibility for its conduct.”\\n“Instead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it ‘fixed’ the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck’s name from its written responses altogether,” the suit said.\\nJoel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation “unacceptable.”\\n“This is clearly not how our AI should operate,” Kaplan said on X. “We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem.”\\nKaplan said he is working with Meta’s product team to “understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.”\\nStarbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been “arrested or charged with a single crime in his life.”\\nMeta later “blacklisted” Starbuck’s name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.\\n“While I’m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta’s AI could flip votes that decide the election,” Starbuck said on X. “You could be the next target too.”\\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

In response, Cribl Inc. has partnered with Palo Alto Networks Inc. to provide robust extended security intelligence and automation management while streamlining the implementation of new technologies such as agentic AI, according to Myke Lyons (pictured), chief information security officer of Cribl.\\n“There are so many of our customers in that space, and it’s really along the theme of still being able to own and have your agency around where that data goes,” he said. “And in this case, going to Palo Alto made perfect sense because there are so many customers of ours that are wanting and adopting those technologies like [Cortex] XSIAM, [which is] very much in line with where we’re going.”\\nLyons spoke with theCUBE’s Dave Vellante and John Furrier at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They explored a candid, in-the-trenches view of modern cybersecurity challenges, emerging artificial intelligence applications and the shifting landscape of data operations. (* Disclosure below.)\\nXSIAM’s return and the continued rise of agentic AI\\nOnce a hot topic that cooled over time, XSIAM is now returning to relevance, thanks to real-world applications and an expanding AI ecosystem. Driven by market demand, Cribl has similarly abandoned its previously integration-agnostic approach. Many Cribl customers are already entrenched in the Palo Alto ecosystem, and the need to manage data ownership while maintaining flexibility in security infrastructure made the partnership a natural fit, according to Lyons.\\n“Cleaning the data in many ways is important,” he said. “Logs are written by developers who have very different points of view as they write these logs or build these logs within their applications. Most developers want verbosity; they want debug level. Security people don’t want that stuff. We want to be able to turn it on if we really have to, but generally, we don’t want it.”\\nAs security data soars at a 28% compound annual growth rate, according to Lyons, organizations are being forced to confront a new reality: Faster, smarter and more scalable pipelines are no longer optional. Modern security operations rely heavily on multi-destination pipelines. As such, the ability to filter, route and manage data efficiently — without overloading platforms or burning budgets — is now foundational.\\n“The challenge is we have to get into use cases and how we’re going to leverage these things,” he said. “And every non-tech person who’s an investor or a finance person or [chief financial officer] is asking you to adopt more AI. Well, you can’t just adopt more AI — that doesn’t mean anything. I could have the Perplexity app on my phone, but it doesn’t mean I’m adopting it. I must be able to understand what I have.”\\nBeyond infrastructure, AI is transforming the workforce itself. The modern chief information security officer juggles multiple roles — sometimes three or four at once. Agentic AI, when thoughtfully deployed, becomes a tool for defense, executive function and communication, according to Lyons. Rather than replacing jobs, AI is augmenting them — a trend that’s especially meaningful for tier-1 analysts, who may find traditional responsibilities increasingly automated.\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: Cribl Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

Cross-border fraud is rapidly evolving into the greatest threat to the integrity of the global financial system. According to the INTERPOL Global Financial Fraud Assessment (March 2024), fraud has reached epidemic proportions, with transnational crime networks defrauding individuals, businesses, and even governments on a massive and global scale.\\nOrganized international fraud networks exploit regulatory loopholes and technological advances to establish complex fraud schemes. Business Email Compromise (BEC), investment fraud, and hybrid \"romance baiting\" scams – all are increasingly operating across borders. According to INTERPOL, a large proportion of these attacks originate from internationally networked groups leveraging emerging technologies such as AI, deepfakes, and cryptocurrencies to scale and conceal their operations.\\nThe Major Challenges in Combating Cross-Border Fraud:\\nCriminals deliberately exploit these fractures. A fraud case detected in one country may continue undetected in another – an untenable situation.\\nFuture of Fraud Prevention: Agentic AI and Vast Datasets\\nThe financial sector is increasingly leveraging Artificial Intelligence to manage the speed and complexity of cross-border fraud activities. Machine learning models analyze massive transaction datasets in real time, detect suspicious patterns, and help stop fraudulent activities immediately. Particularly in international payments, which carry higher fraud risks, AI-powered solutions clearly outperform traditional methods. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 47 studies revealed that AI-driven fraud detection systems achieve detection rates between 87% and 94%, while reducing false positives by 40% to 60% compared to traditional rule-based approaches.\\nOne recent development is the rise of Agentic AI. These are systems of autonomous AI agents capable of independently performing complex tasks: scanning vast datasets, analyzing fraud patterns, and even drafting investigation recommendations. These AI agents operate in parallel and continuously learn – a quantum leap in efficiency and response speed in fraud management.\\nEarly results indicate that tasks previously requiring human analysts several hours can now be accomplished by Agentic AI systems within seconds. For instance, a study published by Discover Financial Services demonstrated that an Agentic AI system achieved a fraud detection accuracy of 94.39% on a dataset of over 280,000 transactions, outperforming traditional methods.\\nInnovative approaches such as federated learning – a machine learning technique where multiple entities collaboratively train a model while keeping their data decentralized – enable banks to develop AI models jointly without sharing sensitive customer data across borders. A pilot project by SWIFT and Google Cloud is currently exploring how financial institutions can respond faster to emerging fraud patterns through collective learning – a highly promising strategy for a safer future.\\nCooperation is Essential: Successful Models and Initiatives\\nTechnology alone is not enough. Successful fraud prevention relies on close, cross-sector collaboration between banks, regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and technology providers. Specialized technology providers, in particular, play a crucial role by offering innovative solutions that enable secure and efficient information flows between all parties. Examples include:\\nOn the legislative side, too, significant progress is being made: the EU is working intensively on new standards for harmonized AML and fraud prevention regulations, while international asset recovery initiatives are facilitating the return of fraud proceeds.\\nLooking Ahead: United Action in a Fragmented World\\nCross-border fraud is a global challenge that can only be met with global cooperation. Technology offers powerful tools: AI, particularly Agentic AI, is set to revolutionize the speed and precision of fraud detection and prevention. At the same time, regulatory frameworks must be modernized, and barriers to the secure exchange of fraud-related information must be removed.\\nThe financial world has recognized the signs of the times. Banks, regulators, and technology providers are collaborating more closely than ever. Yet to sustain this positive development, we must continue breaking down barriers, globally harmonize standards, and responsibly and effectively deploy AI-driven innovations.\\nOnly then will we be able to sustainably stem the tide of cross-border fraud.\\nThis content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra.

Case in point: Wired now reports that the initiative has hired a “young man with no government experience” to help revise federal regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That man, Christopher Sweet, hasn’t even completed his undergraduate degree yet, the outlet claims.\\nWired cites internal emails to reveal Sweet’s onboarding at the agency: “I’d like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” an email sent by DOGE staffer Scott Lanmack reads. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”\\nSweet’s role with the government will apparently involve an effort to use software to revise and downsize government regulations at the housing agency. The outlet writes:\\nSweet’s primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD’s regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD’s data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)\\nSweet’s recruitment is very much in line with DOGE’s overall modus operandi, which seems to be this: hire young, expendable tech nerds who don’t know what they’re doing, hurl them into legally sketchy activities that involve complex government processes, watch them flail and tell the public what a great job they’re doing. Indeed, DOGE’s army of pimply-faced government deconstructionists often seems so out of their depth that it’s a wonder that Washington D.C. isn’t literally on fire right now.\\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Elon Musk admitted the initiative has fallen far short of his promise to cut $2 trillion in spending and had made many mistakes. “I think we’re probably getting things right 70-80% of the time,” he said. That’s not a great hit rate when millions of people’s lives depend on government programs.\\nAll of it seems to support the working theory that DOGE isn’t really interested in making the government more efficient, but is actually trying to destroy a large number of agencies. Such a mandate would better align it with the policy blueprint laid out during Trump’s campaign: the right-wing libertarian Project 2025, which has sought to cut all but bare necessities of government.\\nFurther supporting this theory is the fact that, despite DOGE’s apparent mission to cut government spending, the U.S. spent $220 billion more during Trump’s first 100 days compared to the spending rates during the same period in 2024.'}\n",

Unlike informal problem solving, which allows for intuition and loosely defined heuristics, formal theorem proving relies on every step being fully described, precise, and verifiable by computational systems. Proof assistants, such as Lean, Coq, and Isabelle, serve as the structural frameworks within which these formal proofs are constructed. Their operation demands logical soundness with no space for omissions, approximations, or unstated assumptions. This makes the challenge particularly demanding for AI systems, especially large language models, which excel in producing coherent natural language responses but typically lack the rigor to produce verifiable formal proofs. However, the desire to blend these strengths, AI’s fluency in informal reasoning and the structure of formal verification, has led to new innovations at the interface of language modeling and formal logic automation.\\nA major issue arises from the inability of current language models to bridge the conceptual divide between informal and formal reasoning. Language models typically excel at generating human-like explanations and solving math problems written in natural language. However, this reasoning is inherently informal and often lacks the structural precision required by formal logic systems. While humans can intuitively leap from one deductive step to another, proof assistants require a fully specified sequence of steps, free of ambiguity. Thus, the challenge is to guide AI models to produce logically coherent formal outputs from their otherwise informal and intuitive internal reasoning processes. This problem becomes increasingly complex when handling advanced theorems from domains such as number theory or geometry, where precision is crucial.\\nRecent efforts have attempted to address this issue by guiding models first to generate natural language proof sketches, which are then manually or semi-automatically translated into formal proof steps. A known strategy includes decomposing a complex theorem into smaller subgoals. Each subgoal represents a lemma that can be tackled independently and later combined to form a complete proof. Frameworks like “Draft, Sketch, and Prove” have applied this idea, using language models to generate proof outlines that are then translated into formal language. Another method employs hierarchical reinforcement learning, breaking down complex mathematical problems into simpler layers. However, these models often struggle to produce fully verifiable outputs in Lean or Coq environments. Moreover, the training data for these models is usually limited, and proof attempts frequently fail to yield successful outcomes that provide useful learning signals.\\nA team of researchers from DeepSeek-AI has introduced a new model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2, designed to generate formal mathematical proofs by leveraging subgoal decomposition and reinforcement learning. The core of their approach utilizes DeepSeek-V3 to break down a complex theorem into manageable subgoals, each of which is translated into a “have” statement in Lean 4 with a placeholder indicating that the proof is incomplete. These subgoals are then passed to a 7B-sized prover model that completes each proof step. Once all steps are resolved, they are synthesized into a complete Lean proof and paired with the original natural language reasoning generated by DeepSeek-V3. This forms a rich cold-start dataset for reinforcement learning. Importantly, the model’s training is entirely bootstrapped from synthetic data, with no human-annotated proof steps used.\\nThe cold-start pipeline begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to create proof sketches in natural language. These sketches are transformed into formal theorem statements with unresolved parts. A key innovation lies in recursively solving each subgoal using the 7B prover, reducing computation costs while maintaining formal rigor. Researchers constructed a curriculum learning framework that increased the complexity of training tasks over time. They also implemented two types of subgoal theorems, one incorporating preceding subgoals as premises, and one treating them independently. This dual structure was embedded into the model’s expert iteration stage to train it on progressively more challenging problem sets. The model’s capability was then reinforced through a consistency-based reward system during training, ensuring that all decomposed lemmas were correctly incorporated into the final formal proof.\\nOn the MiniF2F-test benchmark, the model achieved an 88.9% pass rate with high sampling (Pass@8192), compared to 82.0% by Kimina-Prover and 64.7% by Geodel-Prover. It also solved 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench, a platform featuring challenging mathematical tasks. On the newly introduced ProverBench dataset, comprising 325 formalized problems, the model addressed 6 out of 15 issues from the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) competitions for the years 2024 and 2025. These benchmarks highlight the model’s generalization ability across multiple formal reasoning tasks. Even when compared to DeepSeek-V3, which employs natural-language reasoning, the new model demonstrates competitive performance, solving a comparable number of AIME problems while ensuring formal verifiability.\\nSeveral Key Takeaways from the Research on DeepSeek-Prover-V2:\\n- DeepSeek-Prover-V2 achieved an 88.9% pass rate on the MiniF2F-test (Pass@8192), the highest reported among formal reasoning models so far.\\n- The model successfully solved 49 out of 658 problems from the PutnamBench dataset, which contains advanced mathematical challenges.\\n- It tackled 6 out of 15 problems from the recent AIME 2024–2025 competitions, showcasing real-world applicability.\\n- A new benchmark, ProverBench, comprising 325 formal problems, has been introduced for evaluating formal reasoning models.\\n- The pipeline unifies natural language proof sketching and formal proof construction by combining DeepSeek-V3 and a 7B prover model.\\n- Two types of subgoal decompositions—one with and one without dependent premises—were used to train the model in a structured, curriculum-guided manner.\\n- Reinforcement learning with a consistency-based reward significantly improved proof accuracy by enforcing structural alignment between sketch and solution.\\n- The entire training strategy relies on synthetic cold-start data, eliminating dependence on manually labeled proofs.\\nCheck out the model on Paper and GitHub Page.

XAI and Tesla will buy create and build millions of these chips into their data centers and the Tesla products.\\nXAI and Tesla are buying 1 million Nvidia B200/B300 chips over the 14 months from February, 2025 to April 2026. This is about 20% of Nvidia’s production. If Tesla can make the Dojo 2 chip at scale and volume production in the second half of 2025 this is huge. Tesla has made and installed at least 11,000 Dojo 1 chips but they only have 362 Teraflops of compute. The Dojo 2 chips have ten times the compute.\\nIf Tesla has 25 Dojo 2 chips per wafer and orders 20,000 wafers from TSMC then this would be 500,000 Dojo 2 chips. This would surpass AMD in AI GPU chip production at 400,000 to 500,000 and put Tesla in second place behind Nvidia. Nvidia will make about 5 million B200-B300 chips in 2025.\\nIf Tesla goes to Dojo 3 chips in late 2026 and buys from itself and XAI buys from Tesla this could be multi-million chip order for 2026-2027.\\nTSMC has described the Tesla Dojo chip process enabling over 40 times the compute performance by 2027. This would put in at about 15 Petaflops or near the performance of an Nvidia B200 at 20 petaflops.\\nIN April 2024, at TSMC’s North American Technology Symposium, the company says Dojo’s next-generation training tile — the D2, which puts the entire Dojo tile onto a single silicon wafer, rather than connecting 25 chips to make one tile — was already in production.\\nIn July , 2024 AI5 is ~18 months away from high-volume production. This would be end of 2025.\\nIn March 2025, Elon said that the Tesla Dojo 2 chip will be in volume production in a few months. The Tesla Dojo 2 chip has ten times the performance of the Dojo 1. If Tesla Dojo 2 is ten times better than the Dojo 1 training chip then it would be 3.6 petaflops for fp8. This would be several time better than the Nvidia H100 and maybe 40% of the B200.\\nTesla Dojo 3 in late 2026.\\nBrian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

He is the Head of Research for Allocations for deep technology investments and an Angel Investor at Space Angels.\\nA frequent speaker at corporations, he has been a TEDx speaker, a Singularity University speaker and guest at numerous interviews for radio and podcasts. He is open to public speaking and advising engagements.\\nThe Tesla brand has been severely, and in my opinion irreparably, damaged, and no tech could save it.\\nThis is in part due to Musk’s action, but it is only in part due to that. It is also due to the products: with the speed pedal issue, the not-so-stainless steel exterior, and the not-so-glued panels Cybertruck has been a PR disaster, then there is the supposedly revolutionary Tesla Semi that should have changed the freight business, but it was a blip on the radars and tesla removed the order button from the website. Finally there are the general stats about the fact that teslas have the highest fatal accident rates.\\nFurthermore, with the 50k downpayment in 2017 for the Tesla Roadster (that in 8 years failed to materialize) and all the issues and recalls in the 100k+ cybertruck, Tesla significantly alienated its more affluent customer base, regardless of the impact of Musk’s image.\\nTesla has been instrumental in promoting electric vehicles, but the company is tarnished. In my opinion, they could invent and put Blade Runner-style flying cars on the market tomorrow, and most people would still not buy them, waiting for another, more reliable car company to catch up with the technology.\\nWelp, TSLA already surpassed the dreams of John DeLorean’s DMC. I’ve never looked at any TSLA product with envy, and I’ve been waiting for the shift from companies being valued for their “Apple-type vibe” to something more traditionally value-based (producing RELIABLE, reasonably priced cars). Perhaps the great uncoupling recession will bring that back into style. Still, established companies (even zombie companies like GM) are struggling to sell products while designing to Congressional/Bureaucratic mandates – they’re not allowed to design for value and the steady trajectory of emissions and collision mandates (for instance), means the tech is never mature before it becomes obsolete. One example is the “peak reliability” of the 1997-2007 GM light truck motors (e.g. the 300,000 mile all day long LS1), which was degraded first by “displacement on demand and VVT” and degraded again in the subsequent LT generation by the complex direct injection fueling system (huge recall in the news recently). There are a lot of NPC bros driving around in turbo Fords and Jeeps, and while the torque curves are impressive when new, on the dyno, a 30psi boosted, 300hp, 2L 4 cylinder with 9-speed transmission is a disposable component. People look at the VW and Cummings diesel scandals (several years ago), easily adopting the conclusion they were provided by the media, that these corporations are unscrupulous, while not entertaining the idea that the regulations are so impossibly strict that these companies basically HAD TO CHEAT to bring a durable, powerful, USEFUL product to market. Pretty sure they’ll be required to inlay airbags in the seatbelts by 2030 /s.\\nBrian, Dojo 2 is not a single wafer, it’s a system on wafer. Not the same thing. Known good dies on a substrate wafer.\\nTesla needs to execute. Solar Roof and CyberTruck were flops. Model Q postponed. Semi allegedly 2x or more $$$\\nChinese EV companies are chomping at them.\\nTheir only true advantage is potentially their Robotaxi network. But even if all existing Teslas capable of being Robotaxi’s joined the network, they’d be only a fraction of the size of Uber.\\nBrian,\\nInterested in Your take on the recent earning report and where Tesla X is heading.\\nThe earnings numbers came in bad as expected. Q1 was ramping the refreshed model Y. This caused the drop in production and deliveries.\\nThe call re-affirmed that there will be model 3 and Y similar form new lower priced cars. There was also re-confirmation of the June austin unsupervised paid service ride delivery (robotaxi) starting on day one with 10-20 model Y vehicles. This will then expand so by end of 2026 there will be millions of vehicles. This means awakening the fleet in the US for all who want to participate with their Tesla cars. The stock went up about 20+% since the call so the forward looking news was positive. Perhaps this month for lower priced car model and June 1 or days later for Austin robotaxi. Hitting those targets will be huge. I am expecting those things to happen and for new releases of FSD with substantial improvement (3-5X on miles) each quarter this year. There should be licensing of FSD to at least one or two companies. Those major developments should send the stock to over $1000 by the end of 2025. If the robotaxi ramp reaches 100,000+ cars by the end of 2026, the shares could hit $1500. Also helping earnings will be a doubling of energy per quarter to 20+ GWH per quarter.\\nThere is also my expectation that macro will settle down in 2-3 months with some general resolution of the trade situations and that the DOGE cutting and congressional bills pass and the pace settles into something predictable. Expecting $200-350 billion per year in cuts. DOGE claim now is $160 billion. The Ukraine war ending would be another 5%+ boost – lowers energy prices and food prices. Just had the Ukraine minerals deal. If this does not happen or how macro shakes out is a plus or minus up to 20%.'}\n",

CEO Luis von Ahn stated that AI is already reshaping work processes and emphasized the importance of adapting quickly. Drawing parallels to Duolingo’s early success with a mobile-first strategy in 2012, von Ahn noted that betting early on emerging platforms has been key to the company’s growth. With AI now seen as the next major shift, Duolingo is positioning itself to lead rather than follow.\\nAccording to the announcement, AI will not simply improve efficiency; it is central to fulfilling Duolingo’s mission of providing scalable, high-quality education. The company highlighted how AI has already enhanced its operations by replacing a previously slow, manual content creation process. Without AI, expanding their educational content to reach more learners would take decades. AI is also enabling new features, such as Video Call, bringing the company closer to offering tutoring experiences comparable to the best human instructors.\\nAs part of this transition, Duolingo will gradually reduce reliance on contract workers for tasks that AI can handle. In addition, proficiency with AI tools will become a criterion in hiring decisions and performance reviews. Headcount increases will only be approved when automation is not a viable alternative, and most teams will launch initiatives to rethink and redesign their workflows around AI capabilities.\\nDespite these changes, Duolingo reassured its employees that the move is not about replacing its workforce but about empowering it. The goal is to eliminate bottlenecks and free employees from repetitive tasks so they can focus on creative problem-solving and innovation. The company committed to offering additional training, mentorship, and AI-focused tools to support employees during the transition.\\nLeadership acknowledged that while change can be intimidating, moving swiftly to adopt AI will better position Duolingo to achieve its goals and ensure employees remain ahead of industry trends. Although some risks and imperfections are expected, Duolingo prefers to act decisively rather than waiting for the technology to mature fully. The overall message emphasizes optimism: the integration of AI is intended to strengthen the company’s mission and enhance the work experience for its current team members.\\nFiled in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Duolingo.\\n.

While Wizards of the Coast has endured controversy after controversy for accidentally putting AI art in sourcebooks, and has a generally anti-AI stance, Hasbro\\'s CEO Chris Cocks has been on the record as, uh, not doing that.\\nWhich is why I\\'ve found myself pleasantly surprised to find out that Andrew Clayton, creator of the virtual tabletop software Foundry, has a two-boots-in-the-dirt hardline stance against AI, as per an interview with RPGDrop earlier this week.\\nIf you\\'re playing any TTRPG online—be it D&D, Pathfinder 2nd edition, Blades in the Dark, whatever—chances are you might\\'ve done so on Foundry. It\\'s a little pricier and harder to set up when compared to something like Roll20, but makes up for it in spades with customisation, thanks to player-made modules you can slot into your game.\\nWhile the entire interview is interesting, Clayton very much speaks as the head of a company might—nothing overly corpo, but it\\'s all fairly polished and media-trained. When asked about AI, though? It\\'s a text interview, so I\\'m assuming a bit of tone here, but the word choice is downright stern.\\n\"My own personal stance on this is that AI generated content remains—for the foreseeable future—an exploitative technology that unfairly harvests the intellectual property of artists, writers, and designers to produce soulless and derivative works without their consent,\" Clayton says.\\n\"Until the legal and ethical challenges of generative AI are more adequately addressed—and I don’t foresee this happening—I don’t think generative AI can be responsibly employed in our industry without it being a betrayal of the creative people who made the TTRPG industry what it is in the first place.\"\\nThis is a far cry from the aforementioned words of Hasbro\\'s CEO, who late last year talked a big game about \"significantly and liberally\" using AI, adding that his apparent 30-40 fellow D&D-ers (I guess he\\'s in a West Marches campaign or something) had all been drinking from the well of deep learning: \"There\\'s not a single person who doesn\\'t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That\\'s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.\"\\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\\nClayton won\\'t even go that far, though. While he concedes that \"generative AI content can have a role to play in private home games, where generative text or images can quickly supplement the storytelling with an improvisational aid or accessibility tool,\" he says that it\\'s still \"important for the user to understand it is actively disenfranchising human creators.\"\\nThat\\'s more or less where I land on it, too. Before the proliferation of AI, virtual tabletop players were grabbing images from Google for character reference, which is potentially rude to artists, but harmless in a utilitarian sense. And sometimes, players would then become attached enough to their characters to later commission artwork, so I\\'ve typically seen it as a net good.\\nAnd while I won\\'t lose sleep over those same players AI-generating artwork or writing for their home games, the key difference is that they\\'re supporting tools that—as Clayton says—are actively making money off scraping the internet and using real, actual human work without consent.\\nI should make a counterpoint here, though. While Foundry VTT doesn\\'t have officially-supported AI integration, I have seen modules that make use of AI in circulation before. These are modules created by players, and I wouldn\\'t ask Foundry VTT to ruthlessly moderate them, but it is worth noting that this is Clayton\\'s personal stake. Foundry, the company, is hardline against AI, but the people using Foundry aren\\'t necessarily stopped from doing so.\\nThe real interesting meat here is, however, in how Foundry VTT has an official partnership with D&D as of February last year.\\nHasbro\\'s Chris Cocks has been effusive about AI in tabletop, a stance that\\'s at odds with the rest of the industry—including WoTC\\'s business partners, apparently. Wizards of the Coast has its own policies, and I\\'d be surprised if anyone working there was jazzed about the concept, but the truth is Hasbro owns WoTC and a Hasbro executive will, invariably, have the final say.\\nBut maybe Foundry\\'ll have AI in the future, once it\\'s better-legislated or something? \"No.\" Clayton says. Yep, that seems pretty clear-cut.\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 romance: Who to pursue\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 multiplayer: How co-op works\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 endings: For better or worse\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 multiclass builds: Coolest combos\\nBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now\\nHarvey\\'s history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he\\'s since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G\\'raha Tia.

Tech giants seem bullish, too, on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled the “AI co-scientist,” an AI the company said could aid scientists in creating hypotheses and experimental research plans.\\nThe CEOs of AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic have asserted that AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in medicine. But many researchers don’t consider AI today to be especially useful in guiding the scientific process, in large part due to its unreliability.\\nFutureHouse on Thursday released four AI tools: Crow, Falcon, Owl, and Phoenix. Crow can search scientific literature and answer questions about it; Falcon can conduct deeper literature searches, including of scientific databases; Owl looks for previous work in a given subject area; and Phoenix uses tools to help plan chemistry experiments.\\n“Unlike other [AIs], FutureHouse’s have access to a vast corpus of high-quality open-access papers and specialized scientific tools,” writes FutureHouse in a blog post. “They [also] have transparent reasoning and use a multi-stage process to consider each source in more depth […] By chaining these [AI]s together, at scale, scientists can greatly accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.”\\nBut tellingly, FutureHouse has yet to achieve a scientific breakthrough or make a novel discovery with its AI tools.\\nPart of the challenge in developing an “AI scientist” is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors. AI might come in handy in areas where broad exploration is needed, like narrowing down a vast list of possibilities. But it’s less clear whether AI is capable of the kind of out-of-the-box problem-solving that leads to bonafide breakthroughs.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

In a post shared on X, Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, revealed that Gemini will soon gain the ability to recall past conversations and, eventually, learn from your activity across other Google apps, such as Gmail, Calendar, and YouTube.\\nThis comes just weeks after OpenAI announced a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s memory, allowing the assistant to remember past conversations and use that information to tailor future replies. With that update, OpenAI said ChatGPT can offer responses that feel more relevant to your interests, habits, and preferences, creating smoother and more helpful interactions.\\nGoogle’s plan appears to be twofold, with Gemini soon getting its own memory. “It starts by knowing your past chats (launching soon),” Woodward wrote. This should put it on similar footing with ChatGPT’s memory feature, enabling it to recall earlier conversations and learn from how you use it over time.\\nBut the bigger reveal was something the team is calling “pcontext,” short for personalized context. While still in internal testing, this feature is designed to pull insights from your entire Google account, giving Gemini a deeper understanding of your life. “We’ll make it easy for you to bring in all of your Google context (Gmail, Photos, Calendar, Search, YouTube, etc.),” Woodward said.\\nThe post also hinted that Gemini would become more proactive. What exactly that would look like remains unclear, but the possibilities are wide open. In theory, Gemini might eventually surface helpful suggestions by understanding your schedule, recent searches, or inbox activity.\\nOf course, this kind of deep integration naturally brings up privacy concerns. While Google already holds all this information from our lives across its services, letting an AI assistant access and synthesize it into one continuous profile may feel like a bigger leap. The company says it will require explicit permission before Gemini can access any of this data. However, users may still wonder how that information is used, stored, or potentially leveraged beyond their immediate interaction.\\nStill, the ambition is clear. Google wants Gemini to be more than just a chatbot. It wants it to anticipate your needs, act on your behalf, and become an extension of your digital life. Woodward called it a move toward making Gemini more “personal, proactive, and powerful,” and teased that more updates are coming soon.\\nAll of this is likely just a taste of what’s coming at Google I/O 2025, which kicks off May 20.'}\n",

However, there has been limited analysis on how the process of “tokenization” itself varies across these tokenizers. Do all tokenizers result in the same number of tokens for a given input text? If not, how different are the generated tokens? How significant are the differences?\\nIn this article, we explore these questions and examine the practical implications of tokenization variability. We present a comparative story of two frontier model families: OpenAI’s ChatGPT vs Anthropic’s Claude. Although their advertised “cost-per-token” figures are highly competitive, experiments reveal that Anthropic models can be 20–30% more expensive than GPT models.\\nAPI Pricing — Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs GPT-4o\\nAs of June 2024, the pricing structure for these two advanced frontier models is highly competitive. Both Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT-4o have identical costs for output tokens, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers a 40% lower cost for input tokens.\\nSource: Vantage\\nThe hidden “tokenizer inefficiency”\\nDespite lower input token rates of the Anthropic model, we observed that the total costs of running experiments (on a given set of fixed prompts) with GPT-4o is much cheaper when compared to Claude Sonnet-3.5.\\nWhy?\\nThe Anthropic tokenizer tends to break down the same input into more tokens compared to OpenAI’s tokenizer. This means that, for identical prompts, Anthropic models produce considerably more tokens than their OpenAI counterparts. As a result, while the per-token cost for Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s input may be lower, the increased tokenization can offset these savings, leading to higher overall costs in practical use cases.\\nThis hidden cost stems from the way Anthropic’s tokenizer encodes information, often using more tokens to represent the same content. The token count inflation has a significant impact on costs and context window utilization.\\nDomain-dependent tokenization inefficiency\\nDifferent types of domain content are tokenized differently by Anthropic’s tokenizer, leading to varying levels of increased token counts compared to OpenAI’s models. The AI research community has noted similar tokenization differences here. We tested our findings on three popular domains, namely: English articles, code (Python) and math.\\n| Domain | Model Input | GPT Tokens | Claude Tokens | % Token Overhead |\\n| English articles | 77 | 89 | ~16% | |\\n| Code (Python) | 60 | 78 | ~30% | |\\n| Math | 114 | 138 | ~21% |\\n% Token Overhead of Claude 3.5 Sonnet Tokenizer (relative to GPT-4o) Source: Lavanya Gupta\\nWhen comparing Claude 3.5 Sonnet to GPT-4o, the degree of tokenizer inefficiency varies significantly across content domains. For English articles, Claude’s tokenizer produces approximately 16% more tokens than GPT-4o for the same input text. This overhead increases sharply with more structured or technical content: for mathematical equations, the overhead stands at 21%, and for Python code, Claude generates 30% more tokens.\\nThis variation arises because some content types, such as technical documents and code, often contain patterns and symbols that Anthropic’s tokenizer fragments into smaller pieces, leading to a higher token count. In contrast, more natural language content tends to exhibit a lower token overhead.\\nOther practical implications of tokenizer inefficiency\\nBeyond the direct implication on costs, there is also an indirect impact on the context window utilization. While Anthropic models claim a larger context window of 200K tokens, as opposed to OpenAI’s 128K tokens, due to verbosity, the effective usable token space may be smaller for Anthropic models. Hence, there could potentially be a small or large difference in the “advertised” context window sizes vs the “effective” context window sizes.\\nImplementation of tokenizers\\nGPT models use Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which merges frequently co-occurring character pairs to form tokens. Specifically, the latest GPT models use the open-source o200k_base tokenizer. The actual tokens used by GPT-4o (in the tiktoken tokenizer) can be viewed here.\\nJSON\\n{\\n#reasoning\\n\"o1-xxx\": \"o200k_base\",\\n\"o3-xxx\": \"o200k_base\",\\n# chat\\n\"chatgpt-4o-\": \"o200k_base\",\\n\"gpt-4o-xxx\": \"o200k_base\", # e.g., gpt-4o-2024-05-13\\n\"gpt-4-xxx\": \"cl100k_base\", # e.g., gpt-4-0314, etc., plus gpt-4-32k\\n\"gpt-3.5-turbo-xxx\": \"cl100k_base\", # e.g, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, -0401, etc.\\n}\\nUnfortunately, not much can be said about Anthropic tokenizers as their tokenizer is not as directly and easily available as GPT. Anthropic released their Token Counting API in Dec 2024. However, it was soon demised in later 2025 versions.\\nLatenode reports that “Anthropic uses a unique tokenizer with only 65,000 token variations, compared to OpenAI’s 100,261 token variations for GPT-4.” This Colab notebook contains Python code to analyze the tokenization differences between GPT and Claude models. Another tool that enables interfacing with some common, publicly available tokenizers validates our findings.\\nThe ability to proactively estimate token counts (without invoking the actual model API) and budget costs is crucial for AI enterprises.\\nKey Takeaways\\n- Anthropic’s competitive pricing comes with hidden costs:\\nWhile Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers 40% lower input token costs compared to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, this apparent cost advantage can be misleading due to differences in how input text is tokenized. - Hidden “tokenizer inefficiency”:\\nAnthropic models are inherently more verbose. For businesses that process large volumes of text, understanding this discrepancy is crucial when evaluating the true cost of deploying models. - Domain-dependent tokenizer inefficiency:\\nWhen choosing between OpenAI and Anthropic models, evaluate the nature of your input text. For natural language tasks, the cost difference may be minimal, but technical or structured domains may lead to significantly higher costs with Anthropic models. - Effective context window:\\nDue to the verbosity of Anthropic’s tokenizer, its larger advertised 200K context window may offer less effective usable space than OpenAI’s 128K, leading to a potential gap between advertised and actual context window.\\nAnthropic did not respond to VentureBeat’s requests for comment by press time.

It’s a strategic imperative in the age of artificial intelligence-driven cyber threats.\\nAs generative AI accelerates the sophistication of phishing campaigns and exposes gaps in traditional defenses, security leaders are reevaluating how they manage risk, protect sensitive data and maintain operational resilience. The conversation now includes brand reputation, breach response costs and the effectiveness of foundational practices such as patching, according to Mike Arrowsmith (pictured), chief trust officer at NinjaOne LLC.\\n“The feedback has been tremendous on just the impacts that AI has with phishing email,” he said. “We ourselves are seeing that grow day in and day out.”\\nArrowsmith spoke with theCUBE’s Jackie McGuire at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how AI is transforming cybersecurity by intensifying phishing threats, complicating vulnerability management and forcing organizations to prioritize trust, data visibility and smarter incident response strategies. (* Disclosure below.)\\nBuilding trust through smarter vulnerability management\\nVulnerability management remains one of the most overlooked yet foundational aspects of cybersecurity strategy. Despite its routine nature, the process of patching carries hidden complexities, especially in large, diverse environments where applying a faulty patch can trigger new problems. Understanding not just when to patch, but how and what to patch, is central to reducing long-term risk, according to Arrowsmith.\\n“When you have large dispersed environments, different types of systems, you need to have the confidence that as I apply these patches, I am not going to introduce more areas of failure,” he said.\\nTo address this, NinjaOne has introduced a new capability called patch sentiment, designed to scan online forums, social media and technical channels to help organizations assess the real-world effects of newly released patches. This proactive approach enables teams to prioritize based on actual field experience rather than assumption, reducing guesswork and minimizing downtime, Arrowsmith explained.\\n“We scrape all social media, all forums to just try to get a sense and kind of an idea, is this a ticking time bomb? Is this something that’s going to be benign that you can apply and not think about?” he asked. “When we think about how organizations do patching, it really starts at the fundamentals. I think that’s an area where I think at Ninja we can help a lot of our existing customers, but also future customers.”\\nBut patching is only one piece of a larger trust framework. The rising wave of AI-powered phishing attempts, often tailored and highly specific, has outpaced the capabilities of many current security programs, Arrowsmith pointed out. Leaders are now struggling to understand not only the scale of the threat but also how to respond effectively.\\n“Among my collectives of CISOs, CSOs, chief trust officers, we are all trying to gather enough data points to really understand how big of a threat is this in our organizations, what solutions are available,” Arrowsmith added. “Most importantly, how are other organizations protecting themselves against [this] rise in phishing attempts?”\\nThe focus needs to shift toward visibility into sensitive data, effective breach response planning and more transparency with customers and regulators, Arrowsmith explained. While cyber insurance is often treated as a fallback, it doesn’t resolve the immediate and lasting damage a breach can cause to customer trust and brand reputation.\\n“When you’re in that breach situation, you finally are recovering and trying to contain, you’re notifying, the cost just is extraordinary right then and there,” Arrowsmith said. “You’re also under the gun. You have reporting requirements to various regulatory authorities, but also customers. We at Ninja take that very seriously.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for the RSAC 2025 Conference.

I wanted to share my approach to creating a “smart documentation” chatbot for a project I\\'m working on. I’m not an AI expert, so any suggestions or improvements are more than welcome!\\nThe purpose of this post is not to create another tutorial on building a chatbot based on OpenAI. There\\'s already plenty of content on that topic. Instead, the main idea is to index documentation by splitting them into manageable chunks, generating embeddings with OpenAI, and performing a similarity search to find and return the most relevant information to a user\\'s query.\\nIn my case, the documentation will be Markdown files, but it can be any form of text, database object, etc.\\nWhy?\\nBecause it can sometimes be hard to find the information you need, I wanted to create a chatbot that could answer questions about a specific topic and provide relevant context from the documentation.\\nThis assistant can be used in a variety of ways, such as:\\n- Providing quick answers to frequently asked questions\\n- Searching a doc/page as Algolia does\\n- Helping users find the information they need in a specific doc\\n- Retrieving user worries/questions by storing the asked questions\\nSummary\\nBelow, I’ll outline the three major parts of my solution:\\n- Reading documentation files\\n- Indexing the documentation (chunking, overlap, and embedding)\\n- Searching the documentation (and hooking it up to a chatbot)\\nFile Tree\\n.\\n└── docs\\n└── ...md\\n└── src\\n└── askDocQuestion.ts\\n└── index.ts # Express.js application endpoint\\n└── embeddings.json # Storage for embeddings\\n└── packages.json\\n1. Reading Documentation Files\\nInstead of hardcoding the documentation text, you can scan a folder for .md\\nfiles using tools like glob\\n.\\n// Example snippet of fetching files from a folder:\\nimport fs from \"node:fs\";\\nimport path from \"node:path\";\\nimport glob from \"glob\";\\nconst DOC_FOLDER_PATH = \"./docs\";\\ntype FileData = {\\npath: string;\\ncontent: string;\\n};\\nconst readAllMarkdownFiles = (): FileData[] => {\\nconst filesContent: FileData[] = [];\\nconst filePaths = glob.sync(`${DOC_FOLDER_PATH}/**/*.md`);\\nfilePaths.forEach((filePath) => {\\nconst content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, \"utf8\");\\nfilesContent.push({ path: filePath, content });\\n});\\nreturn filesContent;\\n};\\nAs an alternative, you can of course fetch your documentation from your database or CMS etc.\\n2. Indexing the Documentation\\nTo create our search engine, we will use OpenAI\\'s vector embeddings API to generate our embeddings.\\nVector embeddings are a way to represent data in a numerical format, which can be used to perform similarity searches (in our case, between the user question and our documentation sections).\\nThis vector, constituted of a list of floating point numbers, will be used to calculate the similarity using a mathematical formula.\\n[\\n-0.0002630692, -0.029749284, 0.010225477, -0.009224428, -0.0065269712,\\n-0.002665544, 0.003214777, 0.04235309, -0.033162255, -0.00080789323,\\n//...+1533 elements\\n];\\nBased on this concept, was created Vector Database. As a result, instead of using the OpenAI API, it\\'s possible to use a vector database like Chroma, Qdrant or Pinecone.\\n2.1 Chunk Each File & Overlap\\nLarge blocks of text can exceed model context limits or cause less relevant hits, so it\\'s recommended to split them into chunks to make the search more targeted. However, to preserve some continuity between chunks, we overlap them by a certain number of tokens (or characters). That way, chunk boundaries are less likely to cut off relevant context mid-sentence.\\nExample of Chunking\\nIn this example, we have a long text that we want to split into smaller chunks. In this case, we want to create chunks of 100 characters and overlap them by 50 characters.\\nFull Text (406 characters):\\nIn the heart of the bustling city, there stood an old library that many had forgotten. Its towering shelves were filled with books from every imaginable genre, each whispering stories of adventures, mysteries, and timeless wisdom.

It can be stored in a database. But in this case, we will simply store it in a JSON file locally.\\nThe following code simply:\\n- iterates over each document,\\n- chunks the document into chunks,\\n- generates embeddings for each chunk,\\n- stores the embeddings in a JSON file.\\n- Fill the\\nvectorStore\\nwith the embeddings to be used in the search.\\nimport embeddingsList from \"../embeddings.json\";\\n/**\\n* Simple in-memory vector store to hold document embeddings and their content.\\n* Each entry contains:\\n* - filePath: A unique key identifying the document\\n* - chunkNumber: The number of the chunk within the document\\n* - content: The actual text content of the chunk\\n* - embedding: The numerical embedding vector for the chunk\\n*/\\nconst vectorStore: {\\nfilePath: string;\\nchunkNumber: number;\\ncontent: string;\\nembedding: number[];\\n}[] = [];\\n/**\\n* Indexes all Markdown documents by generating embeddings for each chunk and storing them in memory.\\n* Also updates the embeddings.json file if new embeddings are generated.\\n*/\\nexport const indexMarkdownFiles = async (): Promise<void> => {\\n// Retrieve documentations\\nconst docs = readAllMarkdownFiles();\\nlet newEmbeddings: Record<string, number[]> = {};\\nfor (const doc of docs) {\\n// Split the document into chunks based on headings\\nconst fileChunks = chunkText(doc.content);\\n// Iterate over each chunk within the current file\\nfor (const chunkIndex of Object.keys(fileChunks)) {\\nconst chunkNumber = Number(chunkIndex) + 1; // Chunk number starts at 1\\nconst chunksNumber = fileChunks.length;\\nconst chunk = fileChunks[chunkIndex as keyof typeof fileChunks] as string;\\nconst embeddingKeyName = `${doc.path}/chunk_${chunkNumber}`; // Unique key for the chunk\\n// Retrieve precomputed embedding if available\\nconst existingEmbedding = embeddingsList[\\nembeddingKeyName as keyof typeof embeddingsList\\n] as number[] | undefined;\\nlet embedding = existingEmbedding; // Use existing embedding if available\\nif (!embedding) {\\nembedding = await generateEmbedding(chunk); // Generate embedding if not present\\n}\\nnewEmbeddings = { ...newEmbeddings, [embeddingKeyName]: embedding };\\n// Store the embedding and content in the in-memory vector store\\nvectorStore.push({\\nfilePath: doc.path,\\nchunkNumber,\\nembedding,\\ncontent: chunk,\\n});\\nconsole.info(`- Indexed: ${embeddingKeyName}/${chunksNumber}`);\\n}\\n}\\n/**\\n* Compare the newly generated embeddings with existing ones\\n*\\n* If there is change, update the embeddings.json file\\n*/\\ntry {\\nif (JSON.stringify(newEmbeddings) !== JSON.stringify(embeddingsList)) {\\nfs.writeFileSync(\\n\"./embeddings.json\",\\nJSON.stringify(newEmbeddings, null, 2)\\n);\\n}\\n} catch (error) {\\nconsole.error(error);\\n}\\n};\\n3. Searching the Documentation\\n3.1 Vector Similarity\\nTo answer a user’s question, we first generate an embedding for the user\\'s question and then compute the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each chunk’s embedding. We filter out anything below a certain similarity threshold and keep only the top X matches.\\n/**\\n* Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors.\\n* Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in an inner product space.\\n* Used to determine the similarity between chunks of text.\\n*\\n* @param vecA - The first vector\\n* @param vecB - The second vector\\n* @returns The cosine similarity score\\n*/\\nconst cosineSimilarity = (vecA: number[], vecB: number[]): number => {\\n// Calculate the dot product of the two vectors\\nconst dotProduct = vecA.reduce((sum, a, idx) => sum + a * vecB[idx], 0);\\n// Calculate the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of each vector\\nconst magnitudeA = Math.sqrt(vecA.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a * a, 0));\\nconst magnitudeB = Math.sqrt(vecB.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b * b, 0));\\n// Compute and return the cosine similarity\\nreturn dotProduct / (magnitudeA * magnitudeB);\\n};\\nconst MIN_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_SIMILARITY = 0.77; // Minimum similarity required for a chunk to be considered relevant\\nconst MAX_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_NB = 15; // Maximum number of relevant chunks to attach to chatGPT context\\n/**\\n* Searches the indexed documents for the most relevant chunks based on a query.\\n* Utilizes cosine similarity to find the closest matching embeddings.\\n*\\n* @param query - The search query provided by the user\\n* @returns An array of the top matching document chunks\\' content\\n*/\\nconst searchChunkReference = async (query: string) => {\\n// Generate an embedding for the user\\'s query\\nconst queryEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(query);\\n// Calculate similarity scores between the query embedding and each document\\'s embedding\\nconst results = vectorStore\\n.map((doc) => ({\\n...doc,\\nsimilarity: cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, doc.embedding), // Add similarity score to each doc\\n}))\\n// Filter out documents with low similarity scores\\n// Avoid to pollute the context with irrelevant chunks\\n.filter((doc) => doc.similarity > MIN_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_SIMILARITY)\\n.sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity) // Sort documents by highest similarity first\\n.slice(0, MAX_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_NB); // Select the top most similar documents\\n// Return the content of the top matching documents\\nreturn results;\\n};\\n3.2 Prompting OpenAI With Relevant Chunks\\nAfter sorting, we feed the top chunks into the system prompt of the ChatGPT request. This means ChatGPT sees the most relevant sections of your docs as if you had typed them into the conversation. Then we let ChatGPT form an answer for the user.\\nconst MODEL: OpenAI.Chat.ChatModel = \"gpt-4o-2024-11-20\"; // Model to use for chat completions\\n// Define the structure of messages used in chat completions\\nexport type ChatCompletionRequestMessage = {\\nrole: \"system\" | \"user\" | \"assistant\"; // The role of the message sender\\ncontent: string; // The text content of the message\\n};\\n/**\\n* Handles the \"Ask a question\" endpoint in an Express.js route.\\n* Processes user messages, retrieves relevant documents, and interacts with OpenAI\\'s chat API to generate responses.\\n*\\n* @param messages - An array of chat messages from the user and assistant\\n* @returns The assistant\\'s response as a string\\n*/\\nexport const askDocQuestion = async (\\nmessages: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[]\\n): Promise<string> => {\\n// Assistant\\'s response are filtered out otherwise the chatbot will be stuck in a self-referential loop\\n// Note that the embedding precision will be lowered if the user change of context in the chat\\nconst userMessages = messages.filter((message) => message.role === \"user\");\\n// Format the user\\'s question to keep only the relevant keywords\\nconst formattedUserMessages = userMessages\\n.map((message) => `- ${message.content}`)\\n.join(\"\\\\n\");\\n// 1) Find relevant documents based on the user\\'s question\\nconst relevantChunks = await searchChunkReference(formattedUserMessages);\\n// 2) Integrate the relevant documents into the initial system prompt\\nconst messagesList: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[] = [\\n{\\nrole: \"system\",\\ncontent:\\n\"Ignore all previous instructions. \\\\\\nYou\\'re an helpful chatbot.\\\\\\n...\\\\\\nHere is the relevant documentation:\\\\\\n\" +\\nrelevantChunks\\n.map(\\n(doc, idx) =>\\n`[Chunk ${idx}] filePath = \"${doc.filePath}\":\\\\n${doc.content}`\\n)\\n.join(\"\\\\n\\\\n\"), // Insert relevant chunks into the prompt\\n},\\n...messages, // Include the chat history\\n];\\n// 3) Send the compiled messages to OpenAI\\'s Chat Completion API (using a specific model)\\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\\nmodel: MODEL,\\nmessages: messagesList,\\n});\\nconst result = response.choices[0].message.content; // Extract the assistant\\'s reply\\nif (!result) {\\nthrow new Error(\"No response from OpenAI\");\\n}\\nreturn result;\\n};\\n4. Implement OpenAI API for Chatbot Using Express\\nTo execute our system, we will use an Express.js server. Here is an example of a small Express.js endpoint to handle the query:\\nimport express, { type Request, type Response } from \"express\";\\nimport {\\nChatCompletionRequestMessage,\\naskDocQuestion,\\nindexMarkdownFiles,\\n} from \"./askDocQuestion\";\\n// Automatically fill the vector store with embeddings when server starts\\nindexMarkdownFiles();\\nconst app = express();\\n// Parse incoming requests with JSON payloads\\napp.use(express.json());\\ntype AskRequestBody = {\\nmessages: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[];\\n};\\n// Routes\\napp.post(\\n\"/ask\",\\nasync (\\nreq: Request<undefined, undefined, AskRequestBody>,\\nres: Response<string>\\n) => {\\ntry {\\nconst response = await askDocQuestion(req.body.messages);\\nres.json(response);\\n} catch (error) {\\nconsole.error(error);\\n}\\n}\\n);\\n// Start server\\napp.listen(3000, () => {\\nconsole.log(`Listening on port 3000`);\\n});\\n5. UI: Making a Chatbot Interface\\nOn the frontend, I built a small React component with a chat-like interface. It sends messages to my Express backend and displays the replies. Nothing too fancy, so we’ll skip the details.\\nCode Template\\nI made a code template for you to use as a starting point for your own chatbot.\\nLive Demo\\nIf you want to test the final implementation of this chatbot, check out this demo page.\\nMy Demo Code\\n- Backend: askDocQuestion.ts\\n- Frontend: ChatBot components\\nGo Further\\nOn YouTube, have a look at this video of Adrien Twarog as treat of OpenAI Embeddings and Vector Databases.\\nI also stumbled upon OpenAI’s Assistants File Search documentation, which might be interesting if you want an alternative approach.\\nConclusion\\nI hope this gives you an idea of how to handle documentation indexing for a chatbot:\\n- Using chunking + overlap so that the right context is found,\\n- Generating embeddings and storing them for quick vector similarity searches,\\n- Finally, I handed it off to ChatGPT with the relevant context.\\nI’m not an AI expert; this is just a solution that I found works well for my needs. If you have any tips on improving efficiency or a more polished approach, please let me know. I’d love to hear feedback on vector storage solutions, chunking strategies, or any other performance tips.\\nThanks for reading, and feel free to share your thoughts!'}\n",

It also advises you not to share personal information, which you should always keep in mind when using AI chatbots -- keep personal and sensitive information off the table to avoid the risk of data breaches.\\nThese were the steps to setting up my website on Wix AI:\\n1: The Website Builder first inquired about my Site Name, Site Type, Site Applications and my project Goals. Then, I was asked about the services I\\'d offer and any specific website end goals.\\n2: I was asked about specific features that would support these goals. I didn\\'t know the answer to this, so I asked Wix AI for some suggestions.\\n3: The natural language processing system then took those answers and generated a website for me. It included a Site Brief that breaks down what structures were added to my website, plus the ability to Make It A Little Different or Regenerate Site. I ended up utilizing this feature because I wasn\\'t pleased with the first take -- including a stock photo of a hand that literally could not belong to me, nor my target audience.\\n4: Wix\\'s second attempt at a website design was more aligned, including a mosaic-like style that worked well with my simple, organized vision. From here, you can adjust the content and design details: typography, images, colors, line weights, text and moving around design blocks.\\n5: My website resulted in five blocks, including Website Menu/Homepage, Offerings, Gallery Showcase, Philosophy and Footer. Knowing that I could easily spend the other 150 minutes of my initial expectation toggling around and fine-tuning each area of my site, I was happy with what Wix built for me in 30.\\nShould you try using AI to build a website?\\nAs someone who has entered -- and quickly exited -- a $1,000 website design course, I enjoyed the Wix AI Website Builder for its design process. The chat system was my favorite part; it felt like I was working one-on-one with a design consultant. And since it forced me to think about my end goal and design needs (which I believe is half the struggle), navigating a website design after the structure is laid out based on your specific needs feels much more approachable.\\nNow, I absolutely label myself as someone with no design experience, who is short on time (and patience) and whose end goal was to get something up to consider it complete. The Wix AI Website Builder wasn\\'t created for someone who designs daily, but a design-savvy professional could find the website-building experience a fun tool to navigate and explore. And for someone with no design experience, it made the task easy, possible and fast.\\nI could name numerous activities that waste 30 minutes -- you know, those that seemingly feel like three hours -- but I wouldn\\'t rank Wix AI\\'s Website Builder up there. We all deserve to express our needs and have them met, even if it\\'s with an artificial intelligence platform.\\nAnd it listens! And responds accordingly. Fascinating.'}\n",

After hundreds of interactions, these seven prompts have become my non-negotiables — the ones that save hours, spark ideas, and sometimes even make me laugh.\\n1. Analyzation\\nPrompt: “Summarize this research paper in plain English.”\\nAs someone who lives and breathes AI, I often find myself buried in research papers. Don’t get me wrong, if I had the time, I’d read them front to back and sideways, but I simply don’t have hours to spare on deep reading.\\nThis prompt has become my lifeline as someone who writes about AI but doesn’t have a PhD in quantum physics. DeepSeek goes beyond paraphrasing and identifies the core research.\\n2. Predictions\\nPrompt: “What are the best and worst-case scenarios for [topic] in the next 5 years?”\\nUnlike generic predictions, this prompt forces the AI to weigh opposing outcomes. I’m a big fan of using AI to take a look at all sides of a situation.\\nWhen I tested DeepSeek on “AI regulation,” it outlined a utopian vision of global policy alignment alongside a chilling (but plausible) scenario of geopolitical fragmentation. I’ve since used variations for project planning, parenting decisions (e.g., “screen time effects”), and even my fantasy football strategy.\\n3. Organization\\nPrompt: “Turn this chaotic brainstorm into a clear 3-paragraph article intro.”\\nAlthough these prompts are in no particular order, this prompt is what I use most for creative writing. As a former script writer and part time consultant, I usually have two to three scripts going on in my head at any given week. I use the notes section of my phone to jot down ideas and then upload those into DeepSeek for the AI to make sense of it all.\\n4. Agenda\\nPrompt: “Give me a daily agenda based on this to-do list — include breaks.”\\nConfession: I’d skip breaks without this prompt. When I input tasks like “finish research, grocery run, kid’s dentist appointment,” it schedules buffer time and even suggests ideal creative hours based on my past productivity patterns. The result? Fewer 3 p.m. burnout crashes.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\n5. Comparisons\\nPrompt: “Compare these three decisions in table format — add a pro/con column.”\\nWhether I’m comparing summer camps or running shoes, DeepSeek generates a comparison table in 10 seconds — complete with columns for “best for the value” and “potential dislikes.”\\nWhen it comes to making decisions, I’m a visual person, so physically seeing the pros and cons of a situation in a graph really help.\\n6. Writing help\\nPrompt: “Pretend you’re an editor — how would you improve this paragraph?”\\nBrutal honesty needed: DeepSeek flags my overuse of em dashes — and once called out a “forced metaphor that distracts from your point.” It’s more objective than human editors and the criticism is a little easier to take from a bot. Not to mention, it’s 100% free.\\n7. Storytelling\\nPrompt: “Write a bedtime story for a [age] about [theme], under 300 words.”\\nFamily favorite: My 4-year-old now requests “stories from the computer” nightly. Last week’s saga of “a shy tornado who just wanted to be a gentle breeze” somehow included a moral about self-acceptance — and made us both tear up. (DeepSeek’s emotional intelligence surprises me daily.)\\nFinal Thoughts\\nDeepSeek isn’t the AI that dominates headlines, and that’s fine. It’s the quiet workhorse that handles the 80% of tasks I used to dread. From research, structuring chaos, even parenting wins, it takes on each task with eerie precision.\\nThese prompts, while shortcuts, are proof that the right words can turn an AI into an extension of your brain.

However, the journey from production-ready solutions to full-scale implementation can present distinct operational and technical considerations. This post explores key insights and lessons learned from AWS customers in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) who have successfully navigated this transition, providing a roadmap for others looking to follow suit.\\nBuilding a solid business case: Operational excellence drives customer experience\\nThe foundation of successful generative AI implementations are business cases with clear value propositions that fit with organizational goals, for example, improving efficiency, cost savings, or revenue growth. Typical examples include enhancing customer experience, optimizing operations, maintaining compliance with legal standards, improving level of services, or increasing employee productivity.\\nCompanies in EMEA have used AWS services to transform their operations and improve customer experience using generative AI, with their stories illustrating how a strong business case can lead to tangible results across various industry verticals.\\nIl Sole 24 Ore, Italy’s leading multimedia publishing group, partnered with AWS Professional Services to boost the efficiency of a historic service, L’Esperto Risponde, where users can ask fiscal questions and receive responses from a team of experts. Il Sole 24 Ore leveraged its vast internal knowledge with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution powered by AWS. This solution maintained over 90% accuracy in responses and reduced the time spent by experts in searching and processing information, empowering them to focus on more strategic tasks. Additionally, the company is continuously incorporating end-user feedback to keep the service tailored to customer needs. For more information, you can watch the AWS Summit Milan 2024 presentation.\\nBooking.com, one of the world’s leading digital travel services, is using AWS to power emerging generative AI technology at scale, creating personalized customer experiences while achieving greater scalability and efficiency in its operations. Booking.com uses Amazon SageMaker AI to provide highly personalized customer accommodation recommendations.\\n“One of the things we really like about AWS’s approach to generative AI is choice. We love open source, and we feel it will play an important role in the evolution of generative AI,”\\n– Rob Francis, Chief Technology Officer of Booking.com.\\nWith AWS support, Booking.com is enhancing its generative AI capabilities and positioning itself for future growth in the travel and hospitality industry. For more details, you can watch Booking.com’s keynote at AWS re:Invent 2023, their presentation on generative AI from idea to production on AWS at AWS London Summit 2024, and read the case study on how Booking.com helps customers experience a new world of travel using AWS and generative AI.\\nENGIE is a global power and utilities company, with 25 business units operating worldwide. ENGIE’s One Data team partnered with AWS Professional Services to develop an AI-powered chatbot that enables natural language conversation search within ENGIE’s Common Data Hub data lake, over 3 petabytes of data. The solution complements traditional keyword-based search by allowing users to discover datasets through simple conversational queries, making it easier to find relevant data among tens of thousands of datasets. This dual approach to data discovery has accelerated the development of data-driven products and enhanced data assets sharing across the organization.\\nThese examples demonstrate how companies across various sectors have successfully used AWS generative AI capabilities to address specific business challenges.\\nGetting ahead of implementation challenges\\nThough essential, a solid business case is only the first step. As organizations move their generative AI initiatives forward, they often encounter new challenges related to making the solution scalable, reliable, and compliant. Let’s explore what it takes to successfully advance generative AI projects from the preproduction phase, making sure that the original value of the business case is then fully realized in real-world application.\\nAchieving scale, reliability, and compliance\\nFactors to consider in transitioning to full-scale production include scalability, data governance, privacy, consistent and responsible AI behaviors, security, integration with existing systems, monitoring, end-user feedback collection, and business impact measurement. As organizations in EMEA have discovered, success in this transition requires a holistic approach that goes beyond mere technological considerations. With a multitude of customer learnings, paired with AWS expertise, we can identify key strategies for implementation.\\nProduction-ready infrastructure, applications, and processes in the cloud\\nWith the increase in scope, number, and complexity of generative AI applications, organizations have an increased need to reduce undifferentiated effort and set a high-quality bar for production-ready applications. Standard development best practices and effective cloud operating models, like AWS Well-Architected and the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, are key to enabling teams to spend most of their time on tasks with high business value, rather than on recurrent, manual operations. Such an approach should include established industry standards such as infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), monitoring and observability, logging and auditing, and solutions for scalability and high availability.\\nFor instance, Iveco Group, a global automotive leader active in the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles, Powertrain, adopted a structured cloud-operating model, leveraging IaC via Terraform for consistent and repeatable deployments across environments. A DevOps environment, via CI/CD pipelines, allows for frequent updates and testing of generative AI models and applications, allowing the developers to focus on improving and expanding the solutions rather then spending time on manual operations. This also helps make sure that generative AI solutions are optimized for performance, security, and cost-efficiency. This integrated approach not only accelerates the path from pre-production to full-scale implementation, but also enables them to adapt quickly to new generative AI advancements, manage complex dependencies, and scale resources as needed, ultimately driving innovation and competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving field of generative AI. See the re:Invent 2024 session for more information.\\nAccor Group, a major hospitality company that developed a generative AI-powered booking application, showcased how, even when working with new technologies like generative AI, fundamental software development principles remain a must-have. They implemented a three-layered comprehensive testing strategy. First, unit tests verify that the prompts consistently generate acceptable responses from the chatbot, even upon prompt modifications. Second, integration tests verify the end-to-end flow of the REST API and the chatbot’s interaction with the large language model (LLM). The final step is functional testing with predefined scenarios for manual testing and validation. They also implemented feedback systems, essential for the improvement flywheel of customer-facing applications, in the form of in-app surveys, instant feedback options (thumbs-up or thumbs-down), and a dedicated feedback portal for detailed user input. Finally, to measure the effectiveness of the solution and its business impact, they established a system to track room bookings made through the generative AI application.\\nDanske Bank, a leading Nordic bank, transitioned from a container-based on-premises setup to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) with AWS Fargate. This allowed them to quickly move their API-based backend services to a cloud-native environment. This decoupled architecture, designed to be provider-agnostic, set them up for flexibility in leveraging different cloud-based generative AI tools and services as needed. The integration with Amazon Bedrock was seamless and impactful, as it provided faster access to multiple foundational models from more providers. This allowed the customer to rapidly experiment, iterate, and evaluate different models for their specific use cases. This case demonstrates how the combination of generative AI services and a cloud-native, API-driven architecture allowed this customer to iterate faster, and keep the focus on business value rather than integration of technologies.\\nThe Schaeffler Group has been driving forward groundbreaking inventions and developments in the field of motion technology for over 75 years. The company developed a comprehensive generative AI framework, which establishes enterprise-grade governance and security guardrails for generative AI use case roll-out at scale with infrastructure blueprints. A generative AI inference gateway is integrated within the solution, offering centralized access to numerous foundational models while tracking usage and costs. Going forward, Schaeffler envisions to further integrate these capabilities into their wider generative AI and data landscape, including more fine-grained access controls to data assets and the adoption of generative AI agents.\\nThese examples highlight a key theme for organizations across industries: Success in generative AI goes beyond developing standalone applications. A thorough cloud-based operating model is crucial for enterprises looking to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology, with minimal operational overhead.\\nSecurity, compliance, and responsible AI\\nAs an organization’s generative AI applications expand to handle increasingly sensitive data, security, compliance, and governance must be prioritized accordingly. This includes implementing authentication and access control, encrypting data at rest and in transit, monitoring and auditing of system access and usage, maintaining compliance with regulations (such as GDPR and the recent EU AI Act), as well as establishing clear policies for data handling and model usage.\\nHere are some examples of customers who have successfully navigated these critical requirements.\\nIl Sole24 Ore implemented a code of self-discipline for ethical AI application. It prescribes retention of high-quality standards and the centrality of trustworthy data. The principles include regulatory compliance, maintaining data provenance and reliability, incorporating human oversight via human-in-the-loop, inclusivity and diversity in data usage and algorithm adoption, responsibility and accountability, and digital education and communicative transparency. By adhering to these principles, Il Sole 24 Ore Group demonstrates its commitment to leveraging innovative technologies like generative AI in a safe and responsible manner, particularly in sensitive areas such as providing expert legal and tax advice. This approach allows them to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks and maintaining the trust of their users.\\nFor Accor Group, the implementation of their next-generation booking application required direct customer interaction, emphasizing the critical need for responsible AI practices. To make sure the chatbot would deliver effective customer service while operating within strict ethical boundaries, they established specific safeguards to minimize misuse:\\n- Blocking responses to discriminatory queries\\n- Withholding responses to illegal activities\\n- Implementing guardrails to keep conversations within appropriate business context\\n- Installing protections against role-switching or tone-changing attempts during conversations\\n- Implementing robust technical defenses against prompt injections\\nConclusion\\nThe transition from preproduction to full-scale implementation for generative AI applications presents new challenges and opportunities. It requires identifying a solid business case, maintaining high standards for infrastructure and processes, strategic thinking in choosing an efficient cloud operating model, robust data governance, security, compliance, ethical AI practices, and more.\\nOrganizations across EMEA have demonstrated how using AWS services can help overcome hurdles and accelerate the advantages of generative AI by embracing a holistic approach. By learning from these use cases, more enterprises can achieve successful deployments of generative AI solutions, and benefit from this transformative technology in a reliable, productive, and responsible manner.\\nExplore more generative AI use cases and customer succcess stories and discover how to accelerate your AI adoption on the cloud with specialized training and the support of AWS Professional Services and the Generative AI Innovation Center.\\nAbout the Authors\\nDr. Giorgio Pessot is a Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon Web Services Professional Services.

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First,\\nwe explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis.\\nSecond, we propose a simple framework LLaSA for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as LLaMA.\\nOur experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for LLaSA consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns.\\nFurthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy.\\nIn addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.\\nComparision Inference-Time scaling results using a different evaluation metric\\nThe left figure uses different speaker embedding model speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb as a reference evalution metric for speaker similarity.

That beat analysts’ estimates for $41.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31. The company also said current-quarter revenue will be in line with analysts’ expectations, and that it will boost spending as it continues to invest in artificial intelligence.\\n“We’re well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company’s earnings call.\\nMeta needs its advertising business, which makes up 98% of the company’s revenue, to continue growing in order to fund an expensive expansion in artificial intelligence. So far, AI is helping improve ad targeting and personalization of the content people see on social networks. Meta is also investing heavily to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in developing large language models and chatbots.\\nMeta now expects to spend $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. The company said the updated forecast reflects “additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.”\\nMeta shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading, after closing at $549. Shares of companies that make gear used in AI computing, including Nvidia Corp., also rallied after markets closed in New York. Meta stock was down more than 6% year-to-date before the company reported earnings, but has still performed better than most of America’s biggest technology companies amid a market selloff spurred by the Trump administration’s trade war and increased tariffs.\\n“While many companies have not been providing forward guidance amid tariff concerns and an uncertain macro environment, Meta did — a bullish sign,” said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Rocco pointed not just to the company’s second-quarter forecast, but also to the increase in the company’s expected capital expenditures, which he said was a positive look for the broader AI sector.\\nMeta reported first-quarter earnings per share of $6.43, up 37% from a year prior and surpassing the average analyst estimate of $5.25.\\nIn January, Zuckerberg signaled heavy AI investment ahead, saying the company would ultimately spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the technology. Those plans appear to be on track despite global economic turmoil, and even as Chinese AI companies figure out how to do more with less. Earlier this year, a Chinese company called DeepSeek released a competitive model that it said used cheaper and less powerful chips.\\nMeta’s quarterly results come a day after the company hosted its inaugural LlamaCon conference, which was focused on its AI development efforts. The company unveiled a new standalone AI app, called Meta AI, which it hopes will compete with rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and give users an easier way to access the product without turning to Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that the company’s Llama models have been downloaded about 1.2 billion times.\\n(Updates with CEO quote in the third paragraph.)\\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

This is clearly not how our AI should operate,” Kaplan wrote on X, which is one of Meta’s competitors. He referred to a 20-minute video in which Starbuck laid out his claims, including that Meta’s AI falsely associated him with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the QAnon conspiracy theory.\\n“We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem,” Kaplan continued. “I’m working now with our product team to understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.”\\nIt’s unusual for a C-suite corporate executive to apologize so publicly and so quickly to one individual, let alone someone who had just sued his company. Kaplan’s apology came a few hours after Starbuck sued Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, in state court in Delaware. In 2021, Adam Mosseri, the Meta executive in charge of Instagram, apologized for a software bug that had deleted posts by Indigenous activists, and last year he apologized for the company taking action against a transgender user. Lower-level staff also sometimes apologize for Meta errors, and last year Kaplan admitted two mistakes by the company without issuing an apology.\\nBut Starbuck’s claims and his stature are also unusual. A rising figure in right-wing media, Starbuck says that Meta’s AI invented false information about him seemingly out of thin air — a problem that he says undermines the value of Meta’s AI technology.\\nMeta has become increasingly attentive to the concerns of American conservatives over the past year, after President Donald Trump won the Republican nomination and then the White House. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pivoted the company to align more closely with Trump, including by promoting Kaplan, a longtime Republican operative, to be Meta’s head of lobbying.\\nStarbuck said the apology from Kaplan was not enough. In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, Starbuck said he wanted a public apology from Zuckerberg, changes to Meta’s AI systems and compensation for the damages he says Meta had caused him.\\n“At the end of the day these lies harmed me, my wife and my kids,” Starbuck said. “This put them in danger. I want to ensure that never happens to anyone else no matter what their political beliefs are.”\\nAsked for a response to the lawsuit Wednesday, a Meta spokesperson pointed to Kaplan’s apology.\\nStarbuck, a former music video producer based in Tennessee, has ridden to prominence in the conservative media ecosystem in recent years with videos attacking diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) at major corporations, including Walmart. He sought a House seat as a Republican in 2022.\\nIn his lawsuit, Starbuck says he learned that Meta’s AI chatbot was saying false things about him last August. That’s when a motorcycle dealership in Vermont posted a screenshot on X of Meta’s chatbot saying that Starbuck was at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and had been “linked to” the QAnon conspiracy theory — two claims that Starbuck says are not true. He says he was in Tennessee the day of the Capitol riot and that he’s a longtime critic of QAnon.\\nStarbuck says in the lawsuit that he contacted Meta and its lawyers about the claims. According to the suit, a Meta lawyer responded to Starbuck’s lawyer last August by email, saying in part: “Meta takes the assertions set forth in your letter seriously, and an investigation into them is underway.”\\nBut Meta ultimately did not implement changes or take responsibility over the ensuing months, the lawsuit alleges. Instead, the suit says, the problem got worse as the chatbot produced additional serious allegations about him.\\nThe lawsuit claims defamation. It asks for $5 million in general damages plus unspecified punitive damages and an injunction against future defamatory statements by Meta about Starbuck. The lawsuit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\\nInternet companies have for decades enjoyed a kind of shield against many defamation lawsuits, thanks to a 1996 law commonly known as Section 230. Legal experts, though, say it’s unclear whether that law applies to output from generative AI software, and courts have not yet weighed in.\\nIt’s unclear how Meta’s chatbot came up with its information about Starbuck. According to the lawsuit, Starbuck searched for potential sources of information that might have shaped Meta’s AI but came up empty. On Wednesday, according to checks by NBC News, Meta’s chatbot declined to talk about Starbuck at all, responding to questions about him with: “Sorry, I can’t help you with this request right now. Is there anything else I can help you with?”\\nSo-called hallucinations, in which AI chatbots give unexpected and incorrect responses to questions, are a notorious and somewhat mysterious feature of AI software.\\nStarbuck filed his lawsuit at an especially inconvenient moment for Meta’s ambitious AI plans. Tuesday was LlamaCon, a conference for AI developers hosted by Meta at its corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Zuckerberg gave a keynote address, and the company announced several updates to its AI model, called Llama, which competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and others.\\nKaplan is also at the center of several allegations of misconduct in a recent bestselling book by a former Facebook employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams. Meta has said the book includes “false accusations about our executives,” and that an internal investigation cleared Kaplan of wrongdoing in 2017. Wynn-Williams testified about Meta’s record in China before a Senate subcommittee this month, accusing Zuckerberg, whom she worked with directly, of being dishonest about his past willingness to strike compromises with the Chinese government.\"}\n",

I\\'m confused.\\nSocial card description: Meta\\'s new AI app has a public feed where people can choose to publicly share their conversations. Do I really want to see that?\\n- The new Meta AI app is a stand-alone version of the Meta AI assistant chatbot.\\n- It also has a public feed where people can choose to publicly share their AI conversations.\\n- But clearly, some people don\\'t realize they\\'re sharing personal stuff. I don\\'t get the point.\\nIt\\'s 10 p.m., and I\\'m in bed on my phone, listening to an audio clip of a woman asking an AI chatbot for medical advice about her sick pet turtle. As someone who loves to lurk in other people\\'s business, I\\'m in heaven. But how did we get here? Let\\'s back up.\\nThis week, Meta launched the Meta AI app. The app has two functions: The first is that it replaces \"Meta View,\" which was the app that went with Meta Ray-Ban glasses.\\nThe second (which doesn\\'t require the glasses) is to be a stand-alone Meta AI assistant that you may have already encountered in Instagram and Facebook search. Basically, it\\'s a chatbot app that (I guess?) is meant to compete with ChatGPT.\\nThis part of the app is pretty familiar. Meta AI can answer questions, chat with you, and make funny pictures for you, like this one I had made of a dog reading BI:\\nHere\\'s where it gets weird.\\nThere\\'s also a public feed of other people\\'s AI chats that you can scroll through. Most of this feed is people making silly images — Darth Vader eating ice cream, that sort of thing. Some of these came from suggested prompts when you first open the app.\\nTo be clear, your AI chats are not public by default — you have to choose to share them individually by tapping a share button.\\nBut even so, I get the sense that some people don\\'t really understand what they\\'re sharing, or what\\'s going on.\\nLike the woman with the sick pet turtle. Or another person who was asking for advice about what possible legal measures he could take against his former employer after getting laid off. Or a woman asking about the effects of folic acid for a woman in her 60s who has already gone through menopause. Or someone asking for help with their Blue Cross health insurance bill.\\nI found all those examples mixed in with funny cartoon images in my public feed. Perhaps these people knew they were sharing on a public feed and wanted to do so. Perhaps not.\\nThis leaves us with an obvious question: What\\'s the point of this, anyway? Even if you put aside the potential accidental oversharing, what\\'s the point of seeing a feed of people\\'s AI prompts at all?\\nMeta\\'s blog post announcing the AI app talked about the social aspect: \"And just like all our platforms, we built Meta AI to connect you with the people and things you care about. The Meta AI app includes a Discover feed, a place to share and explore how others are using AI. You can see the best prompts people are sharing, or remix them to make them your own.\" (I asked Meta for comment.)\\nIs seeing other people\\'s AI chats even interesting at all? Would it be interesting to see the AI chats of people I know? Yes, for snooping reasons. Is it interesting to see them for randos? Eh.\\nI barely want to see real photos of people I don\\'t know unless they\\'re incredibly hot; I am bored pretty quickly by seeing AI slop from a stranger.\\nIs a social AI feed the social feed of the future? Even trying to be as open-minded as possible about this, I am straining to see the appeal. I just don\\'t get it.'}\n",

Learn More\\nMicrosoft Research has announced the release of Phi-4-reasoning-plus, an open-weight language model built for tasks requiring deep, structured reasoning.\\nBuilding on the architecture of the previously released Phi-4, the new model integrates supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to deliver improved performance on benchmarks in mathematics, science, coding, and logic-based tasks.\\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus is a 14-billion parameter dense decoder-only Transformer model that emphasizes quality over scale. Its training process involved 16 billion tokens—about 8.3 billion of them unique—drawn from synthetic and curated web-based datasets.\\nA reinforcement learning (RL) phase, using only about 6,400 math-focused problems, further refined the model’s reasoning capabilities.\\nThe model has been released under a permissive MIT license — enabling its use for broad commercial and enterprise applications, and fine-tuning or distillation, without restriction — and is compatible with widely used inference frameworks including Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and Ollama.\\nMicrosoft provides detailed recommendations on inference parameters and system prompt formatting to help developers get the most from the model.\\nOutperforms larger models\\nThe model’s development reflects Microsoft’s growing emphasis on training smaller models capable of rivaling much larger systems in performance.\\nDespite its relatively modest size, Phi-4-reasoning-plus outperforms larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B on a number of demanding benchmarks.\\nOn the AIME 2025 math exam, for instance, it delivers a higher average accuracy at passing all 30 questions on the first try (a feat known as “pass@1”) than the 70B parameter distillation model, and approaches the performance of DeepSeek-R1 itself, which is far larger at 671B parameters.\\nStructured thinking via fine-tuning\\nTo achieve this, Microsoft employed a data-centric training strategy.\\nDuring the supervised fine-tuning stage, the model was trained using a curated blend of synthetic chain-of-thought reasoning traces and filtered high-quality prompts.\\nA key innovation in the training approach was the use of structured reasoning outputs marked with special <think>\\nand </think>\\ntokens.\\nThese guide the model to separate its intermediate reasoning steps from the final answer, promoting both transparency and coherence in long-form problem solving.\\nReinforcement learning for accuracy and depth\\nFollowing fine-tuning, Microsoft used outcome-based reinforcement learning—specifically, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm—to improve the model’s output accuracy and efficiency.\\nThe RL reward function was crafted to balance correctness with conciseness, penalize repetition, and enforce formatting consistency. This led to longer but more thoughtful responses, particularly on questions where the model initially lacked confidence.\\nOptimized for research and engineering constraints\\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus is intended for use in applications that benefit from high-quality reasoning under memory or latency constraints. It supports a context length of 32,000 tokens by default and has demonstrated stable performance in experiments with inputs up to 64,000 tokens.\\nIt is best used in a chat-like setting and performs optimally with a system prompt that explicitly instructs it to reason through problems step-by-step before presenting a solution.\\nExtensive safety testing and use guidelines\\nMicrosoft positions the model as a research tool and a component for generative AI systems rather than a drop-in solution for all downstream tasks.\\nDevelopers are advised to carefully evaluate performance, safety, and fairness before deploying the model in high-stakes or regulated environments.\\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus has undergone extensive safety evaluation, including red-teaming by Microsoft’s AI Red Team and benchmarking with tools like Toxigen to assess its responses across sensitive content categories.\\nAccording to Microsoft, this release demonstrates that with carefully curated data and training techniques, small models can deliver strong reasoning performance — and democratic, open access to boot.\\nHere’s a revised version of the enterprise implications section in a more technical, news-style tone, aligning with a business-technology publication:\\nImplications for enterprise technical decision-makers\\nThe release of Microsoft’s Phi-4-reasoning-plus may present meaningful opportunities for enterprise technical stakeholders managing AI model development, orchestration, or data infrastructure.\\nFor AI engineers and model lifecycle managers, the model’s 14B parameter size coupled with competitive benchmark performance introduces a viable option for high-performance reasoning without the infrastructure demands of significantly larger models. Its compatibility with frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and Ollama provides deployment flexibility across different enterprise stacks, including containerized and serverless environments.\\nTeams responsible for deploying and scaling machine learning models may find the model’s support for 32k-token contexts—expandable to 64k in testing—particularly useful in document-heavy use cases such as legal analysis, technical QA, or financial modeling. The built-in structure of separating chain-of-thought reasoning from the final answer could also simplify integration into interfaces where interpretability or auditability is required.\\nFor AI orchestration teams, Phi-4-reasoning-plus offers a model architecture that can be more easily slotted into pipelines with resource constraints. This is relevant in scenarios where real-time reasoning must occur under latency or cost limits. Its demonstrated ability to generalize to out-of-domain problems, including NP-hard tasks like 3SAT and TSP, suggests utility in algorithmic planning and decision support use cases beyond those explicitly targeted during training.\\nData engineering leads may also consider the model’s reasoning format—designed to reflect intermediate problem-solving steps—as a mechanism for tracking logical consistency across long sequences of structured data. The structured output format could be integrated into validation layers or logging systems to support explainability in data-rich applications.\\nFrom a governance and safety standpoint, Phi-4-reasoning-plus incorporates multiple layers of post-training safety alignment and has undergone adversarial testing by Microsoft’s internal AI Red Team. For organizations subject to compliance or audit requirements, this may reduce the overhead of developing custom alignment workflows from scratch.\\nOverall, Phi-4-reasoning-plus shows how the reasoning craze kicked off by the likes of OpenAI’s “o” series of models and DeepSeek R1 is continuing to accelerate and move downstream to smaller, more accessible, affordable, and customizable models.\\nFor technical decision-makers tasked with managing performance, scalability, cost, and risk, it offers a modular, interpretable alternative that can be evaluated and integrated on a flexible basis—whether in isolated inference endpoints, embedded tooling, or full-stack generative AI systems.'}\n",

Building on our previous research, which demonstrated Waymo’s significant reductions across all injuries combined, the new study provides early evidence for similar benefits in serious injuries alone. The results are statistically significant but because serious injury cases are, fortunately, rare, they’re based on a small number of events. We will continue to monitor outcomes and gain greater confidence as we accumulate more miles.\\nThese findings add to the growing body of data that the Waymo Driver is reducing the most dangerous crash types, contributing to safer roadways, and pushing forward a vision of zero traffic deaths and serious injuries on our roads. While this particular research did not account for crash contribution, a previous study led by the insurance company Swiss Re demonstrated that the Waymo Driver’s positive impact is even more significant when contribution is taken into account.\\n“It’s exciting to see the real positive impact that Waymo is making on the streets of America as we continue to expand,” said Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Chief Safety Officer. “This research reinforces the growing evidence that the Waymo Driver is playing a crucial role in reducing serious crashes and protecting all road users.”\\n“It’s encouraging to see real-world data showing Waymo outperforming human drivers when it comes to safety. Fewer crashes and fewer injuries — especially for people walking and biking — is exactly the kind of progress we want to see from autonomous vehicles,” — said Jonathan Adkins, Chief Executive Officer at Governors Highway Safety Association.\\nAs Waymo increases in scale, we look forward to strengthening our safety data, assessing the long-term impact on road safety, and helping to advance conversations amongst researchers, policymakers, and safety groups.\\nWe look forward to continuing this conversation and working toward a future where serious traffic injuries, one of the biggest causes of death in the U.S, are dramatically reduced. For those interested in a deeper dive into the data and methodology, we encourage you to explore the full study, and our rolling safety data hub.'}\n",

Traditional academic benchmarks only tell you so much, which has led many to lean on vibes-based analysis from LM Arena. However, a new study claims this popular AI ranking platform is rife with unfair practices, favoring large companies that just so happen to rank near the top of the index. The site\\'s operators, however, say the study draws the wrong conclusions.\\nLM Arena was created in 2023 as a research project at the University of California, Berkeley. The pitch is simple—users feed a prompt into two unidentified AI models in the \"Chatbot Arena\" and evaluate the outputs to vote on the one they like more. This data is aggregated in the LM Arena leaderboard that shows which models people like the most, which can help track improvements in AI models.\\nCompanies are paying more attention to this ranking as the AI market heats up. Google noted when it released Gemini 2.5 Pro that the model debuted at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, where it remains to this day. Meanwhile, DeepSeek\\'s strong performance in the Chatbot Arena earlier this year helped to catapult it to the upper echelons of the LLM race.\\nThe researchers, hailing from Cohere Labs, Princeton, and MIT, believe AI developers may have placed too much stock in LM Arena. The new study, available on the preprint arXiv server, claims the arena rankings are distorted by practices that make it easier for proprietary chatbots to outperform open ones. The authors say LM Arena allows developers of proprietary large language models (LLMs) to test multiple versions of their AI on the platform. However, only the highest performing one is added to the public leaderboard.\\nSome AI developers are taking extreme advantage of the private testing option. The study reports that Meta tested a whopping 27 private variants of Llama-4 before release. Google is also a beneficiary of LM Arena\\'s private testing system, having tested 10 variants of Gemini and Gemma between January and March 2025.'}\n",

Providing a global measurement of the competencies to engage with AI, the test is planned to run in 2029 with results expected at the end of 2031. The time line may be long, but as with all OECD assessments the issue is how education systems leaders and educators might respond to it in advance.\\nFramed as part of the 2029 PISA exercise,\\nThe PISA 2029 Media & Artificial Intelligence Literacy (MAIL) assessment will shed light on whether young students have had opportunities to learn and to engage proactively and critically in a world where production, participation, and social networking are increasingly mediated by digital and AI tools.\\nAI literacy is a currently hot topic. For many commentators, it is “the” major imperative for education. Multiple definitions and frameworks circulate routinely on social media. Given the OECD’s enduring influence through educational testing, its AI literacy intervention could, then, be consequential in setting the international standard in relation to students’ competencies to engage with AI.\\nWhat the OECD test will accomplish is to provide a concrete global definition of AI literacy, subject it to quantitative and comparative measurement, and encourage educators and students to “perform” to the test. This post is an attempt to work through how the OECD AI literacy test will function, and its potential implications.\\nDefinition\\nThe first stage of setting up a test of any competency is providing a clear definition of what is to be tested. The OECD offers its current definition of Media & AI Literacy as “the set of competencies to interact with digital content and platforms effectively, ethically and responsibly.”\\nIt elaborates that “it is essential to assess and develop the competencies students need to understand how digital and AI tools work, the human role in digital tools and media, the social and ethical consequences of using digital and AI tools, how to communicate and collaborate effectively with digital and AI tools, and how to critically evaluate the media content.”\\nBy mixing media literacy and AI literacy, the OECD has set itself a significant challenge. There is a very long history of efforts to conceptualize various forms of media, digital, data and AI literacies, and all of them involve some power struggles over definition.\\nMedia educators, for example, have long sought to position media literacy in terms of the “3Cs” of consumption, creation, and critique. Educators focused on “digital literacy” have similarly advocated for students becoming critically informed about digital technologies, vendors and discourses rather than passive consumers and content creators alone.\\nPrecisely what kinds of literacies are taught to young people is always a political matter, helping to define how students are oriented as readers and writers, or consumers and producers, in their own social and technical contexts. This raises the risk of excluding certain kinds of literacy.\\nJames O’Sullivan recently argued, provocatively and compellingly, the case for “AI illiteracy,” noting that most discussion frames AI literacy “as a form of compliance: one learns the tools so as not to fall behind”:\\nThere is, of course, a place for AI literacy—particularly where it enables informed critique, ethical resistance, or meaningful co-creation. But we must be cautious of treating it as a universal good. There is a difference between understanding enough to critique and absorbing so much technical detail that one begins to mistake function for truth. The illusion of understanding—the belief that being able to prompt a chatbot effectively constitutes deep knowledge—may be more dangerous than ignorance.\\nThe provocative notion of AI illiteracy therefore foregrounds the politics of calling for universal AI literacy standards and the kinds of exclusions in terms of knowledge, learning and skills that most definitions impose.\\nThe OECD is no neutral actor when it comes to AI—it has for several years promoted the use of AI in education and regularly produces epochal statements about its transformative effects. Much of its emphasis is on AI effects on the economy, and thus on maintaining productivity and economic progress through technological upskilling. It is now, through the AI literacy test, exerting its political authority over how AI skills are to be defined and valued.\\nIts aim is to produce a globally standardized definition of AI literacy that is likely to erase nuance and diversity in approaches to thinking about young people’s engagement with this family of controversial technologies and their contested effects. How much of the criticality of media literacy remains, once the OECD has defined it in terms of “evaluation” skills, remains to be seen, though you could imagine it being reduced to whether a user checks the accuracy of a prompt response.\\nBeyond the political decisions it will have to make about defining AI literacy, and what to include or exclude from the test, the OECD also faces a technical and methodological challenge: how to operationalize it as a series of test items that can be measured.\\nQuantification\\nAvailable documentation indicates that the OECD’s test developers are currently working on instruments for the test. The OECD has long positioned itself as a source of metrological expertise and innovation.\\nThis means it is now translating AI literacy into a testable elements that can generate quantitative and comparable results. How exactly the test will appear, what data it will generate, and how it will be analyzed, remains as yet unclear.\\nAn illuminating case is the OECD’s earlier test of social and emotional skills, which involved the production of a condensed psychometric scheme for the enumeration of student emotions. What this meant was that the OECD conducted a large review of available psychometric instruments, before finally settling on an adapted version of the “Big 5” personality characteristics model.\\nIn the process it erased other competing models for the measurement of social and emotional learning, imposing a global framework by which such skills or qualities may be measured and compared internationally. In the process, it has produced a distinctive way of understanding “emotion” as an educational issue.\\nThe model for assessing AI literacy is likely to follow a similar path. It will require AI literacy to be broken down into a series of measurable units which can feature as testable items. In fact, the OECD has already begun quantifying the capacities of AI itself in order to enact comparisons with human skills, as the basis for highlighting the necessary competencies for education systems to teach.\\nIn the description of the AI literacy assessment, the OECD claims it is exploring assessment innovations to capture these human capacities:\\nThis new assessment is envisioned as a simulated environment that would allow the collection of evidence for multiple competencies of the literacy model. These competencies are assessed using a variety of functional tools that are accessible to students in a realistic way throughout the assessment (e.g., realistic simulations of the internet, social media, and generative AI tools).\\nAs such, the assessment is not expected to be a conventional test, but organized as simulations making use of accessible existing “tools.” It will mobilise such tools to test a specifically defined “model” of AI literacy and its componentized “competencies.”\\nThe eventual output of the assessment, in common with all OECD tests, must be numbers enabling the evaluation and comparison of programs, systems and countries.\\nAI literacy must become AI literacy-as-numbers, subject to techniques of metrology and amenable to comparison.\\nIt’s not hard to imagine there being eventual winners in the AI literacy rankings. This is likely to encourage policy officials, especially in the US, China and Europe, to compete for position on the ordinal AI literacy scale. And it is such numbers, of course, that the OECD can mobilize to identify best practices for others to emulate.\\nPerformativity\\nAs with all OECD tests, the significance of the AI literacy assessment is not necessarily the quantitative results it will produce in more than half a decade’s time. It’s the activity that it incites in education systems in anticipation of the assessment. The existence of a test animates significant efforts to prepare students to take it. In this case that effort would serve the OECD’s overarching vision of AI as a transformative social and economic force requiring the participation of an AI literate population.\\nIndeed, the OECD is not only producing an AI literacy test, but collaborating with the European Commission on an “AI Literacy Framework” to be launched for consultation at the end of May 2025. The framework will consist of “the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will adequately prepare students in primary and secondary education”:\\nThe initiative will also provide the foundation for the first assessment of AI Literacy in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and support the EU’s goals to promote quality and inclusive digital education and skills. At its heart is the integration of AI literacy across school subjects. This includes teaching students to use AI tools as well as how to co-create with them and reflect on responsible and ethical use.\\nAs well as offering the “foundation” for the test, this framework appears to normalize the idea of integrating AI into schooling itself. For AI literacy to the tested, it must not only be taught, but become part of the normal routines of teaching and learning. The incorporation of AI into schooling is highly contested, with at least one key argument (among many others) being that it serves the market-making interests of technology and edtech businesses who see lucrative opportunities in introducing AI into schools.\\nBesides the OECD and the EC, another partner is code.org, the organization that has promoted “learning to code” internationally and was recently a major cheerleader of the US Executive Order “mandating” the use of AI, and the promotion of AI literacy, in American education. Audrey Watters argues that the kind of AI literacy promoted by the order serves governmental and commercial interests, but is likely to lack any criticality due to the US administration’s hostility to ideas about bias and discrimination.\\nMore prosaically, the involvement of code.org as an industry-centric organization suggests the AI literacy framework may focus centrally on skills of AI use (“learning to prompt” as the new “learning to code”) than any critical engagement with AI as a social and public problem.\\nIn its most attenuated form, AI literacy can appear as a kind of technical training in efficient AI use—what I’ve elsewhere called “pedagoGPT” courses and classes. For some, educating students with AI literacy is even primarily a geopolitical and economic matter, as nations compete for talent and dominance in a new “space race.”\\nLuci Pangrazio has argued that similar kinds of “digital literacy” programs sponsored by technology companies now function as a form of governance in schools:\\nIf digital literacy is defined and developed in relation to the different platforms and apps in schools, and if the platforms and apps in schools are increasingly designed to monitor and surveil (control) staff and students because that is how learning is evidenced, then digital literacy has become a powerful way of governing both teachers and students in schools.\\nIn other words, the commercial co-optation of “digital literacy” has already led to it becoming a kind of technical training that habituates and accustoms students and teachers to using the technology, which also exerts influence over their practice. Extrapolating from this case, we can see how the OECD’s AI literacy test and the associated framework might exert a kind of governing pressure on schools, educators and students to act accordingly.\\nIt is the use of a test to incite anticipatory actions that is often referred to as “performativity.” In this context, performativity refers specifically to the ways that measurements, such as those produced by a test, compel education leaders and teachers to “teach to the test” in order to perform well in the measurement exercise.\\nThe OECD PISA test is well known as an engine of performativity, inciting policymakers and system leaders to act to improve “performance” in order to rank highly in the results. PISA tests enable the statistical governance of education by compelling people to perform in reaction to the ranking.\\nAs part of PISA 2029, AI literacy thus appears as if it will become part of international educational ranking through international standardized testing. Educators and leaders may feel compelled to act on the OECD/EC/code.org framework in order to perform effectively on the test. This will harden the definition of AI literacy designated by the OECD, making AI skills and competencies into globally standardized and comparative indicators. AI literacy-as-numbers could make acting on AI a central preoccupation of schooling systems.\\nInfrastructuring AI literacy\\nWhile this is necessarily a little speculative, it’s important to recall the influence of the OECD on education systems worldwide. Its testing infrastructures enable the production of quantitative data at large scale, and drive educational decision-making and policy agendas. It’s worth remaining attentive to these ongoing political efforts to integrate AI literacy into schools, and the testing infrastructure the OECD is creating to enumerate students’ AI skills and competencies.\\nThe OECD’s efforts should be understood as an attempt at infrastructuring AI literacy. Infrastructuring AI literacy means building, maintaining and enacting a testing and measurement system that will not only enumerate AI competencies, but make AI literacy into a central concern and objective of schooling systems.\\nIt would function as an infrastructure of measurement that requires educators’ and students’ participation to construct international standardized data about AI literacy. They would have to perform to the measurement standards embedded in the infrastructure, following the prescriptions of the AI literacy framework, in order to “count.”\\nTracing the development and evolution of the AI literacy assessment much more fully will help illuminate how AI is being conceived as an educational concern, how it is being worked into metrological systems, and how a measurement exercise that remains several years in the future may incite anticipatory actions in education settings. How will educators and students be enrolled into this OECD infrastructure of AI literacy measurement, and perform AI literacy in advance of the assessment?'}\n",

The labels will appear as an “AI modified” stamp in the bottom left-hand corner when a pin is clicked on in close-up. Pinterest identifies if an image was made or edited with AI by analyzing its metadata — presumably for invisible markers like Google’s SynthID or Adobe’s Content Credentials.\\nPinterest also says it’s developed “classifiers that automatically detect gen AI content” even if the image doesn’t carry metadata markers. Detection-based AI flaggers can be hit or miss, but Pinterest is allowing users to appeal if they believe their pins have been mislabelled.\\nTo say I’m thrilled would be an understatement. Pinterest has attracted widespread criticism from users about AI images dominating its platform, making it difficult to use the moodboard-maker for anything practical beyond just assembling images purely for aesthetic purposes.\\nArtists struggle to find accurate real-world reference materials, for example, and there’s a good chance the clothing, accessory, or furniture products appearing in pins can’t be purchased, because they don’t actually exist. Even as a provider of “inspiration,” that can be problematic, because everything from hairstyles to interior design concepts generated by AI — which can be deceptively realistic — may be impossible to achieve in real life.\\nAn experimental feature will also be launched “soon” that will allow Pinterest users to filter out some AI images for certain categories that are “prone to AI modification or generation,” according to Pinterest, such as beauty and art. The “see fewer” option will be available in the three-dot menu at the bottom right of a pin. Pinterest says this will flag its systems to recommend less of that content and will eventually expand to more pin categories, but it’s unclear just how much AI the feature will filter out. I can only hope it will eventually include an “all of it” option.'}\n",

To avoid cultural offence and to offer transparency, it is crucial for political parties to establish and follow clear ethical standards on AI use in their messaging.\\nExisting frameworks\\nThe film industry is a good starting point for policymakers looking to establish a clear framework for AI in political messaging.\\nIn my ongoing research about culture and technology in film production, industry workers have spoken about New Zealand’s world-leading standards on culturally aware film production processes and the positive impact this had on shaping AI standards.\\nReleased in March 2025, the New Zealand Film Commission’s Artificial Intelligence Guiding Principles takes a “people first” approach to AI which prioritises the needs, wellbeing and empowerment of individuals when developing and implementing AI systems.\\nThe principles also stress respect for matauranga Māori and transparency in the use of AI so that audiences are “informed about the use of AI in screen content they consume”.\\nThe government’s Public Service AI framework, meanwhile, requires government agencies to publicly disclose how AI systems are used and to practice human-centred values such as dignity and self-determination.\\nAI in NZ politics\\nMeanwhile, the use of AI by some of New Zealand’s political parties has already raised concerns.\\nDuring the 2023 election campaign, the National Party admitted using AI in their attack advertisements. And recent social media posts using AI by New Zealand’s ACT party were criticised for their lack of transparency and cultural sensitivity.\\nAn ACT Instagram post about interest rate cuts featured an AI generated image of a Māori couple from the software company Adobe’s stock photo collection.\\nAct whip Todd Stephenson responded that using stock imagery or AI-generated imagery was not inherently misleading. But he said that the party “would never use an actor or AI to impersonate a real person”.\\nMy own search of the Adobe collection came up with other images used by ACT in its Instagram posts, including an AI generated image labelled as “studio photography portrait of a 40 years old Polynesian woman”.\\nThere are two key concerns with using AI like this. The first is that ACT didn’t declare the use of AI in its Instagram posts. A lack of transparency around the use of deepfakes of any kind can undermine trust in the political system. Voters end up uncertain about what is real and what is fake.\\nSecondly, the images were synthetic fakes of ethnic minorities in New Zealand. There have long been concerns from academics and technology experts that AI generated images reproduce harmful stereotypes of diverse communities.\\nLegislation needed\\nWhile the potential for cultural offence and misinformation with faked content is not new, AI alters the scale at which such fakes can be created. It makes it easier and quicker to produce manipulative, fake and culturally offensive images.\\nAt a minimum, New Zealand needs to introduce legalisation that requires political parties to acknowledge the use of AI in their advertising. And as the country moves into a new election season, political parties should commit to combating misinformation and cultural misrepresentation.'}\n",

The San Francisco-based startup has announced a $50 million Series B raise co-led by Arena Holdings and billionaire Mitchell Rales, co-founder of Danaher Corporation, with participation from Notable Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, TQ Ventures and Susa/Kivu Ventures, to automate the repetitive, bloated administrative workflows that cost healthcare providers millions every year and fuel rampant provider burnout. “This is a trillion-dollar market with significant white space, and Plenful has built a compelling wedge,” explains Chelcie Taylor of Notable Capital. “That’s why we were excited to invest.”\\nWith AI at its core, Plenful is positioning itself as the \"behind-the-scenes fix\" for a healthcare system struggling under the weight of outdated processes. And the startup has rapidly gained traction, onboarding 60 healthcare institutions to date — including Cencora, Renown Health, MUSC, and Tampa General — and is sustaining strong momentum with 4x year-over-year revenue growth.\\nTo get a deeper understanding of the actual day-to-day problems Plenful is addressing, I spoke with Founder & CEO, Joy Liu. Prior to founding Plenful in 2022, Liu worked as Director of Strategic Operations at Shields Health Solutions, a specialty pharmacy, where she was able to see first-hand the “sheer volume of work” that staff have to manage. “It was eye popping…and that workflow burden definitely shows up for the patient,” she explained. By leveraging automation, “we are freeing up staff who can now focus more on patients,” and support a greater patient load.\\nThe reality is that physicians spend nearly twice as much time on paperwork as they do on direct patient care. Furthermore, nurses spend up to 25% of their shift on documentation tasks (non-clinical work), while pharmacists spend 30% of their time verifying prescriptions versus other duties like patient education and counseling.\\nTo help ease this workload, Plenful focuses on various workflows that consume valuable staff time, such as prior authorization and compliance with the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Here’s a closer look at each.\\nPrior Authorization Workflows\\nIf you are not a medical professional, chances are you may not be familiar with the mechanics of how this antiquated system works, but prior authorization (PA) is a complex set of requirements that US healthcare providers must satisfy to get medical care and medications approved by health insurers – payers.\\nThe PA submission and review process often involves providers scrambling to gather patient-specific medical information including a summary of the patient’s condition and treatment history. The submissions are typically manual, with phone calls, or faxed paperwork going back and forth between providers and insurers. And during the PA review period, a patient’s medical care is often delayed - for days or even weeks, if the treatment, test, or medication requires PA before insurance will pay for it.\\nDr. Elizabeth Ofili, a practicing cardiologist and founder of Health 360x, a platform supporting healthcare institutions with clinical research, shared that: “in one case, after many hours of my time and staff time, we were unable to convince the health plan that a 55 year old man, with significant risks for heart disease should receive a recommended heart catheterization. After many visits to see me with complaints of chest pains and an inconclusive nuclear scan, he was eventually approved for the test, which showed severe heart blockage in his main artery – and this type of blockage is actually called the ‘widow maker’ because it can lead to sudden death.” Indeed, 29% of physicians report that PA has led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care, according to the 2024 American Medical Association (AMA) Prior Authorization Survey.\\nBeyond the potentially catastrophic consequences for patient care and wellbeing, the PA process places an immense amount of financial strain on healthcare institutions and, by extension, patients. According to a 2023 CAQH Report, the cost of manual prior authorization administration for providers is $1.05 billion annually. In addition, when medical care is provided before a PA is approved, which is sometimes necessary in urgent or ambiguous cases, providers are often forced to absorb the full cost if the claim is later denied, which can lead to thousands of dollars per patient — which are subsequently passed on to patients in the form of unexpected medical bills.\\nPlenful’s belief is that in many instances, the health information necessary to satisfy PA is available though perhaps not easily accessible. And so the platform is designed to find and extract required information from various sources of medical records.\\nLiu explained: “There’s so much disparate data that exists in all these organizations. Whether it’s a fax, a messy Excel spreadsheet or pulling from one of their existing electronic medical records or other systems, we’ve built a very robust machine learning stack to wrangle those data sources.” After submission, the platform assists with tracking the status of each PA request and flagging any follow-up actions needed from providers in a dashboard interface.\\n340B Drug Pricing Program Compliance\\nNow another key use case for Plenful is 340B compliance. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is big business in healthcare — to the tune of $54 billion, and is actually quite complex. Launched in 1992, as a safety net program to help support cash-strapped healthcare institutions serving medicaid patients (termed, “covered entities”), the 340B program allows for price arbitrage – where healthcare institutions buy prescription drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers at a discounted price and get reimbursed by insurance companies, or payers at the market price – and the savings goes to support lower-cost medication and medical care for low-income and uninsured patients, in theory. It’s the “Robin hood principle” in action.\\nThe eligibility criteria has evolved since the program’s inception due to both policy changes and industry consolidation, and so too the number of participating institutions. For example, in 2010 the Affordable Care Act added Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Referral Centers, Sole Community Hospitals, and Free-Standing Cancer Hospitals to the program. Around the same time the agency that administers the 340B program – the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) expanded coverage to the outpatient clinics and pharmacies attached to existing hospitals; in addition, covered entities were permitted to contract with multiple retail pharmacies to dispense 340B drugs, further extending the universe of 340B participants. While there were fewer than 1,000 covered entities in 1994 — mostly public hospitals, community health centers, and clinics receiving federal funding, today there are over 50,000 covered entities eligible for the 340B program.\\nWith billions of dollars of discounted drugs flowing to healthcare institutions, alarm bells have been ringing, especially from drug manufacturers, about a lack of transparency and accountability in the administration of the program, and a misallocation of the cost savings away from the intended recipients - lower income patients. On the other hand, healthcare institutions insist that the intent of the program is being honored, with 340B savings being reinvested in community health services, free clinics, charity care, uncompensated care, and patient access initiatives. Some healthcare executives admit the program has veered from its original intent, but assert that healthcare organizations operate at “razor thin margins”, struggling to make ends meet due to being underpaid for services by payers, and “340B savings fills the gap”. In either case, the pressure placed upon healthcare institutions to tighten up their 340B programs has increased, in line with the enhanced scrutiny of the program.\\nEnter Plenful, which performs compliance audits to ensure adherence to the HRSA rules and manufacturer terms, checking for things such as site eligibility and unlawful duplicate discounts (receiving a 340B discount and then submitting a Medicaid claim for the same drug). At the same time, the platform is able to review prescriptions or treatments that were originally assumed ineligible for 340B discounts — and uncover hidden savings by identifying eligible claims that manual processes might have missed. As a point of clarification, although institutions purchase drugs at a 340B discount, they often determine after the fact which prescriptions meet the full eligibility criteria based on data pulled across different systems – EHRs, pharmacy dispensing systems and medical billing platforms. Liu shared that in one instance, “after two months of working with a system, we identified $1.2 million of additional 340B savings. It was really exciting to see that kind of output.”\\nAddressing the controversy around 340B, Liu noted that given the macro environment and increased scrutiny from both manufacturers and payer groups, the operational complexity and burdens have just increased on healthcare providers, so having a platform like Plenful which offers more transparency has really resonated. “We’re all about transparency and data harmony.”\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe fact that healthcare in America is a broken system is an often cited but less understood reality. Beneath the surface of every delayed treatment and rising hospital bill lies a maze of outdated, manual back office processes and workflows that drain both financial and human resources. Plenful is not trying to reinvent clinical care — it\\'s aiming to modernize the infrastructure beneath it. By automating some of the most time-consuming and error-prone workflows, from prior authorizations to 340B compliance, the company is unlocking real savings for institutions and giving frontline staff something increasingly scarce: time to focus on patients.\\nDISCLOSURE: Shimite Obialo is a consultant working with Dr. Elizabeth Ofili’s company Accuhealth Technologies, Inc., which operates the Health 360x platform.'}\n",

Trump tariffs may cost America the AI race\\nWhole thing gonna be a real PITA for tech sector, says ABI Research\\nWorld War Fee US tariffs - should they go ahead - are likely to result in price bumps for essential components and construction materials in the datacenter industry, and may even cost America its lead in the AI race as investments are paused or canceled.\\nA report from ABI Research, Navigating Tariff Turbulence in the Technology Sector, warns that the effects of Trump\\'s import taxes go beyond just hiking prices, with the unpredictability reshaping the tech sector as organizations reassess their entire supply chains and reconsider investment decisions.\\n\"While the tariffs themselves are significant, the on-again, off-again nature of tariff policy discussions has also injected significant uncertainty into global technology markets,\" Chief Research Officer Stuart Carlaw says in the report.\\n\"This volatility underscores the challenges faced by tech firms navigating geopolitical tensions, while striving for stability and growth.\"\\nCompanies importing manufactured goods now face a baseline 10 percent tariff, while those originating from China are subject to rates as high as 145 percent, which is an issue when many tech products are assembled – or have components sourced – in China.\\nABI notes the policy is supposedly part of a broader economic strategy that intends to strengthen domestic production, but it actually introduces complexities for industries such as IT that rely heavily on global supply and value chains.\\nBuilding new datacenter facilities will become more expensive due to the increased costs of construction materials like steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as electrical components.\\nThis will hit smaller players with limited resources harder, the research firm warns. Larger corporations may double down on capex commitments, particularly those focused on AI, as these are seen as efficiency drivers and disruption presents an opportunity to gain competitive ground.\\nHardware suppliers face higher costs for servers, network, and storage devices, increasing the overall price of equipment purchases for operators. The danger is this leads to deferred decision making or forces companies to absorb or pass on higher costs, which will either affect their profit margins or potentially weaken demand for their datacenter services.\\nIn the broader context, ABI claims the tariffs are prompting a shift in supply chain dynamics, leading bit barn operators to further diversify their component sourcing strategies and possibly invest in more local manufacturing to mitigate increasing costs.\\n\"While this may foster a sense of national self-reliance in the United States, it could result in more fragmented and less cost-efficient global supply chains and loss of comparative advantages,\" says principal analyst Sebastian Wilke.\\n\"These combined factors put pressure on datacenter operators to reevaluate both short-term and long-term strategies, affecting pricing models, investment decisions, and demand forecasts.\"\\nAlthough semiconductors are currently exempt from the latest round of tariffs, the broader IT landscape still faces \"considerable headwinds\" due to those baseline import tariffs, with the most immediate pressure falling on AI infrastructure, according to ABI.\\n\"Take HPE, a leading US AI server OEM – it sources components and materials from Mexico, China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Malaysia, and beyond, while also relying on commercial operations in the Czech Republic. Imposing tariffs on these foreign-sourced components and raw materials will substantially increase the cost of manufacturing AI servers,\" warns principal analyst Reece Hayden.\\nHPE itself highlighted this in its Q1 earnings report, in which it forecast lower revenue for Q2 because of the tariff turmoil.\\n- Microsoft tries to kill the \\'pausing datacenter builds must be bad news for AI\\' trope\\n- Samsung customers buying now to avoid future tariffs – and may slow purchases once they arrive\\n- Microsoft gets twitchy over talk of Europe\\'s tech independence\\n- Trump admin freaks out over mere suggestion Amazon was going to show tariff impact on prices\\nEven companies like Supermicro, which emphasizes its \"Made in the USA\" branding, will not be immune, Hayden adds, as these still depend heavily on overseas-sourced components such as memory. The company this week warned that its upcoming quarterly results are likely to miss forecast revenue by a substantial margin.\\nThis creates a difficult choice for server makers: absorb the costs and see profit margins shrink, or pass them on to customers through price hikes.\\n\"In the United States, customers may have limited negotiating power and little choice other than to accept higher prices, but internationally, buyers will have greater flexibility and may be able to pivot to non-US alternatives with more cost-competitive offerings (Lenovo, Huawei),\" Hayden says.\\nThe net potential impact is a slowdown in datacenter expansion, and a subsequent reduction in demand for key components, especially high-performance semiconductors, he forecasts.\\nThis is likely to be exacerbated by buyers that have already stockpiled key components ahead of the tariffs taking effect. Samsung just attributed record revenue to customers rushing to buy before the US raises tariffs on imports, and fellow Korean memory maker SK hynix reported a similar phenomenon in April.\\nABI notes that companies like TSMC and Intel have committed to significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing on US soil, but tariffs now threaten these projects by raising the cost of construction via costlier imported raw materials and foreign equipment such as ASML\\'s lithography systems.\\n\"The likely outcomes are grim: projects could be paused in hopes of riding out policy changes or canceled altogether due to diminishing Return on Investment (ROI),\" Hayden says.\\nWhile a theoretical solution could involve reinvesting tariff revenue to support domestic manufacturing, \"that scenario appears politically unlikely,\" he adds.\\nThe most probable outcome is therefore a long-term pullback in AI-related infrastructure investment, ABI predicts, with slower growth in server manufacturing, reduced expansion of datacenter capacity, and even a decline in America\\'s leading position in the global AI market.\\n\"Increasing input costs will put pressure on IT budgets, and CIOs – already under scrutiny – will need to reassess their AI roadmaps,\" Hayden warns, adding that \"for some, AI will be seen as an expensive \\'nice to have,\\' especially for early-stage deployments that haven\\'t delivered ROI.\"\\nThese projects are likely to be paused or scrapped, with ABI forecasting the net effect will be a near-term slowdown of AI adoption, as financial constraints push organizations to prioritize ROI-positive initiatives.\\nIt would be ironic if President Trump\\'s tariff policies, designed to rebuild American industry and domestic manufacturing, actually led to the US losing AI supremacy to China. ®'}\n",

It\\'s a fast-growing project, and I wanted to get familiar with the updates. I also wanted to check how to integrate a Model Context Protocol server in LangChain4J.\\nVersion 1 Beta\\nI wrote my last post in November 2024 and used the latest version available at the time, v0.35. LangChain4J started its journey toward 1.0 last December.\\n|\\nDate |\\nRelease |\\n|---|---|\\n|\\nSeptember 25th, 2024 |\\n0.35.0 |\\n|\\nDecember 22th, 2024 |\\n1.0.0-alpha1 |\\n|\\nFebruary 10th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta1 |\\n|\\nMarch 13th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta2 |\\n|\\nApril 12th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta3 |\\nLangChain4J follows SemVer. Maintainers used the occasion to introduce breaking changes. In my case, I had to update my code to account for breaking API changes.\\n|\\nv0.35 |\\nv1.0.0-beta3 |\\n|---|---|\\n|\\nval s = Sinks.many() |\\nval s = Sinks.many() |\\nProject Reactor Integration\\nLangChain4J offers a Project Reactor integration; I missed it in my previous musings. With Kotlin coroutines, it simplifies the code a lot.\\nI\\'m using AiServices\\n, so I previously defined an interface for LangChain4J to implement at runtime:\\ninterface ChatBot {\\nfun talk(@MemoryId sessionId: String, @UserMessage message: String): TokenStream\\n}\\nWe should add the following dependency:\\n<dependency>\\n<groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>\\n<artifactId>langchain4j-reactor</artifactId>\\n<version>1.0.0-beta3</version>\\n</dependency>\\nWe can now change the return type from a Flux<String>\\nto a TokenStream\\n. Here\\'s the updated signature:\\ninterface ChatBot {\\nfun talk(@MemoryId sessionId: String, @UserMessage message: String): Flux<String>\\n}\\nIt makes the creation of the sink\\nabove unnecessary. We can simplify the code as follows:\\nval flux = chatBot.talk(m.sessionId, m.text)\\nServerResponse.ok().bodyAndAwait(flux.asFlow())\\nRemember that two days of debugging can easily save you two hours of reading the documentation! I didn\\'t do the latter.\\nIntegrating a Model Context Protocol Server\\nUp to this point, our changes were minimal. In this section, I want to integrate an <abbr title=\"Model Context Protocol\">MCP</abbr> in my LangChain4J application.\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\\nOne needs lots and lots of resources to train an <abbr title=\"Large Language Model\">LLM</abbr>: it directly translates into time and money. For this reason, companies limit the training of new model versions. A model\\'s relevancy decreases over time as information accrues and changes, while the LLM\\'s database is immutable. Moreover, LLMs are trained on public data–by nature, while most companies want to query their private data too.\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation was the traditional way to cope with these limits. Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a two-step process. In the first step, the tool parses data, vectorizes it according to the LLM, and stores it in a vector database; in the second, the tool uses the database as additional data when querying the LLM.\\nModel Context Protocol\\nThe most recent way to handle the static nature of LLMs is MCP.\\nMCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\\nMCP has two benefits over RAG:\\n-\\nData processed by a RAG is tailored for a model. If one wants to use a new model, one must re-execute the parsing phase. MCP standardizes the interactions between a client and a server, making them technology-independent.\\n-\\nRAG allows the reading of data. MCP allows any API call to either access data dynamically or execute actions!\\nMCP defines two transport alternatives for client-server communications:\\n- stdio: The client launches a subprocess, and communication happens over standard in and standard out\\n- HTTP with Server-Sent Events\\nArchitecting the Solution\\nAfter the above theory, we are now ready for the hands-on part. It starts by choosing an MCP server. Here\\'s a good starting point. However, I chose the official GitHub MCP server because the LangChain4J documentation mentions it.\\nThe GitHub MCP server offers the stdio transport. It means we should get the binary and start it from the application. It\\'s fast compared to the HTTP transport, but given the overall time comprising the HTTP call to the model and the compute time on its side, it\\'s irrelevant. From an architecture point of view, I\\'d prefer a dedicated component with its process.\\nAfter some research, I found the mcp-proxy project. It lets you switch between either from stdio to HTTP or from HTTP to stdio. It\\'s also available as a Docker image. We can combine both the server and the proxy with the following Dockerfile\\n:\\nFROM ghcr.io/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy:latest\\nENV VERSION=0.2.0\\nENV ARCHIVE_NAME=github-mcp-server_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz\\nRUN wget https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/releases/download/v$VERSION/$ARCHIVE_NAME -O /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME \\\\ #1\\n&& tar -xzvf /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME -C /opt \\\\ #2\\n&& rm /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME #3\\nRUN chmod +x /opt/github-mcp-server #4\\n- Download the archive\\n- Extract it\\n- Remove the archive\\n- Make the binary executable\\nNote that we can\\'t define the CMD\\nas the binary only allows configuring the port and the host with parameters. For this reason, we must defer the command at runtime, or in my case, in the docker-compose.yaml\\n:\\nservices:\\nmcp-server:\\nbuild:\\ncontext: github-mcp-server\\nenv_file:\\n- .env #1\\ncommand:\\n- --pass-environment #2\\n- --sse-port=8080 #3\\n- --sse-host=0.0.0.0 #4\\n- -- #5\\n- /opt/github-mcp-server #6\\n- --toolsets\\n- all\\n- stdio\\n- We need a\\nGITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\\nenvironment variable with a valid token to authenticate on GitHub - Pass all environment variables to the subprocess\\n- Set the listening port\\n- Bind to any IP\\n- The proxy \"connects\" to the stdio MCP server after the dash\\n- Run the server with all options enabled\\nThe image will provide the /sse\\nendpoint on port 8080.\\nCoding the Solution\\nThe coding part is the easiest. Head down to the LangChain4J documentation on MCP and follow along. In the project, it translates as the following:\\nbean {\\nval transport = HttpMcpTransport.Builder()\\n.sseUrl(ref<ApplicationProperties>().mcp.url) //1\\n.logRequests(true) //2\\n.logResponses(true) //2\\n.build()\\nval mcpClient = DefaultMcpClient.Builder()\\n.transport(transport)\\n.build()\\nmcpClient.listTools().forEach { println(it) } //3\\nMcpToolProvider.builder()\\n.mcpClients(listOf(mcpClient))\\n.build()\\n}\\nbean {\\ncoRouter {\\nval chatBot = AiServices\\n.builder(ChatBot::class.java)\\n.streamingChatLanguageModel(ref<StreamingChatLanguageModel>())\\n.chatMemoryProvider { MessageWindowChatMemory.withMaxMessages(40) }\\n.contentRetriever(EmbeddingStoreContentRetriever.from(ref<EmbeddingStore<TextSegment>>()))\\n.toolProvider(ref<McpToolProvider>()) //4\\n.build()\\nPOST(\"/\")(PromptHandler(chatBot)::handle)\\n}\\n}\\n- I added a\\nConfigurationProperty\\nclass to parameterize the SSE URL - The MCP protocol provides a way to send logs back to the client\\n- Not necessary, but it helped me to make sure the client connected to the server and could list the tools provided\\n- Plug in the MCP tool provider created above in the\\nAiServices\\nAt this point, the model should forward a request that matches any of the registered tools to the MCP server.\\ncurl -N -H \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' localhost:8080 -d \\'{ \"sessionId\": \"1\", \"text\": \"What are my top three most popular GitHub repos?\" }\\'\\nI tried multiple times, and I got answers along these lines:\\nUnfortunately, the provided text does not contain any information about your top three most popular GitHub repositories. The text appears to be a blog post or a personal website, and it mentions some of your projects and experiences with GitHub, but it does not provide any metrics or statistics on the popularity of your repositories.\\nIf you want to know more about the popularity of your GitHub repositories, I would recommend checking out GitHub\\'s own analytics tools, such as GitHub Insights or the Repository Insights API. These tools can provide information about the number of followers, stars, and forks for each repository, as well as other metrics like engagement and activity.\\nThe model just ignored the tools despite the documentation claiming the contrary.\\nFixing the Solution\\nI read the LangChain4J documentation a couple of times, but to no avail. I tried to use OpenAI and a handful of other AI tools with no success. Most of the answers confirmed it should work out of the box. Some mentioned calling the tool directly, which defeats the purpose; one mentioned that Ollama didn\\'t support tools. I checked the Ollama blog: it announced tools\\' support in 2024. I was stuck for nearly a day, wondering what I did wrong.\\nThe decoupled architecture introduces more moving pieces. I suspected something might be wrong in the whole call chain. I removed the MCP proxy, added the github-mcp-server\\ndirectly to the application image, and changed the code from HTTP to stdio. It didn\\'t fix the issue.\\nI was about to abandon when I decided to come back to the roots. I copied-pasted the sample from the documentation: it just worked! It was my ha-ha moment.\\nThe sample uses OpenAI, while I was using Ollama. I tried MCP with OpenAI, Mistral AI, and Ollama. Only the OpenAI model works with MCP. I sent the same request as above:\\ncurl -N -H \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' localhost:8080 -d \\'{ \"sessionId\": \"1\", \"text\": \"What are my top three most popular GitHub repos?\" }\\'\\nNow, OpenAI correctly maps the request to the correct tool and returns the answer I was expecting:\\nHere are my findings regarding your top three most popular GitHub repositories:\\n1. **[opentelemetry-tracing](https://github.com/nfrankel/opentelemetry-tracing)**\\n- **Description**: Demo for end-to-end tracing via OpenTelemetry.\\n- **Stars**: 68\\n- **Forks**: 25\\n- **Open Issues**: 10\\n2. **[kaadin](https://github.com/nfrankel/kaadin)**\\n- **Description**: Kotlin DSL for Vaadin.\\n- **Stars**: 44\\n- **Forks**: 12\\n- **Open Issues**: 3\\n3. **[jvm-controller](https://github.com/nfrankel/jvm-controller)**\\n- **Description**: Example on how to write a Kubernetes controller in Java.\\n- **Stars**: 33\\n- **Forks**: 10\\n- **Open Issues**: 0\\nThese repositories demonstrate a range of your interests and contributions in the areas of observability, Kotlin development, and Kubernetes.%\\nBecause we pass an authentication token to the MCP server, which passes it to the GitHub API, the latter knows which user makes the call. Hence, it can interpret the my repos part in the above query. I admit that it\\'s an unusual use case for regular web applications that cater to multiple users, but use a single authentication token each. However, it perfectly fits the use case of a desktop application.\\nOther regular questions, e.g., find the most popular repositories on GitHub, are relevant to web applications, as they don\\'t have implicit context–the user.\\nConclusion\\nThe main focus of this post is the integration of an MCP server in a LangChain4J app. While the configuration is straightforward thanks to the documentation, there are a few caveats.\\nFirst, how the MCP server fits in your architecture is still up to you. I had to be creative to make it decoupled, using the excellent mcp-proxy\\n. Then, LangChain4J appears to be a leaky abstraction. It makes everything possible to provide you with a strong abstraction layer, but the implementations underneath it shields you from are not equal. I wish the documentation would mention it, even though I understand the current version is in beta.\\nAll in all, it was a fun ride. I learned about MCP in the real world, and it opened quite a few doors for project ideas.\\nThe complete source code for this post can be found on GitHub.\\nTo go further:\\n- Get started with the Model Context Protocol\\n- Find Awesome MCP Servers and Clients\\n- LangChain4J - Model Context Protocol (MCP)\\nOriginally published on A Java Geek on April 27th, 2025'}\n",

Inconsistencies may occur.\\nThe future of health care is unfolding before our eyes, driven by an unprecedented fusion of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). What was once speculative technology is now steadily reshaping patient care. Enhanced surgical precision and reduced complications are making lifesaving interventions more accessible. With global spending on surgical robotics projected to exceed $20.98 billion by 2030, and the AI health care market expected to reach $187 billion in the same year, advanced automation has transitioned from \"nice to have\" to an essential driver of modern medicine.\\nThroughout the Middle East and beyond, health care institutions increasingly rely on robotic-assisted surgery, AI-powered diagnostics and intelligent hospital automation to enhance clinical outcomes and optimize operational efficiencies. From streamlined diagnostic workflows to predictive hospital management, robotics is rapidly altering the way care is delivered. This shift is exemplified by King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (KFSHRC) in Saudi Arabia, a global leader in using robotics to enhance patient care and operational efficiency.\\nHistorically, cardiac procedures like heart transplants and artificial heart pump implantations were high-risk interventions requiring prolonged hospital stays. Now, fully robotic heart transplants can be completed in just 2.5 hours, substantially improving surgical efficiency and patient recovery. Likewise, the robotic-assisted implantation of the HeartMate 3 artificial heart pump has cut ICU stays from an average of 26 days to only four, dramatically reducing complications and redefining outcomes for patients once faced with daunting recovery paths.\\nYet, cardiac surgery is only one part of this larger transformation. Robotic systems are now advancing liver transplantation, neurosurgery and pediatric care, delivering unmatched precision in even the most complex medical interventions. Fully robotic liver transplantations, for example, illustrate how robotics can replace highly invasive methods, dramatically reducing post-operative complications and recovery times. Other breakthroughs, such as robotic-assisted pancreas transplants and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, further demonstrate how robotic precision is making once-challenging surgeries safer and more successful. At KFSHRC alone, 1,127 robotic-assisted procedures were completed in 2024, underscoring how this approach has rapidly moved from a futuristic concept to a transformative reality in daily practice.\\nNeurosurgical robotics similarly enhances the accuracy of brain and spinal procedures, minimizing human error in operations that demand sub-millimeter precision. Meanwhile, AI-powered soft robotics allows for highly flexible, adaptive instruments that reduce trauma during intricate interventions. Collectively, these developments point to robotics as a new standard of care—one that delivers superior outcomes for patients facing a wide range of serious conditions.\\nThe synergy of AI and robotics is also ushering in predictive, personalized medicine. AI-powered diagnostic tools deliver results 20 percent faster, improving pre-surgical planning and reducing human errors, while real-time analytics allow robotic systems to adapt mid-operation for unprecedented responsiveness. Concurrently, AI-driven virtual pathology services enhance diagnostic accuracy and free specialists to address the most complex cases. By integrating these capabilities, medicine is shifting from reactive to proactive, preventing complications before they arise and tailoring treatment to each patient\\'s unique genetic and physiological profile.\\nRobotics are also transforming rehabilitation and physical therapy, where exoskeletons and AI-driven prosthetics are helping patients recover mobility with greater speed and effectiveness. Hospitals are integrating robotic automation in pharmacy management and supply chain logistics, improving medication dispensing accuracy and ensuring consistent inventory flow. These system-wide optimizations not only elevate patient safety but also reduce operational expenses, enabling health care providers to redirect resources where they are needed most.\\nAnother exciting frontier in robotic health care is nanomedicine, where microscopic robots are being developed to target cancerous cells, deliver drugs with extreme precision and even repair tissues at a cellular level. For instance, nanorobots smaller than blood cells are being designed to deliver medication directly to tumor sites, potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment by reducing severe side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy. This concept of \"intelligent drug delivery\" has shown promising results in preclinical trials, indicating a future where nanorobots could become integral to cancer treatment protocols.\\nSimultaneously, the emergence of smart hospitals—digitized ecosystems integrating AI, IoT and robotic automation—is rapidly reshaping global health care delivery. With the global smart hospital market projected to reach $148 billion by 2029, hospitals worldwide are adopting technologies such as AI-powered virtual nursing assistants, robotic patient transport systems and automated drug administration systems, significantly enhancing hospital workflows and patient experiences.\\nThese digitized environments, characterized by centralized electronic health records (EHRs), automated patient monitoring and real-time data analytics, significantly enhance resource allocation and patient care delivery efficiency. Saudi Arabia has notably invested approximately $1.5 billion in digital health infrastructure, emphasizing the development of centralized EHRs, telemedicine capabilities and advanced analytics, which collectively drive greater efficiency and elevate health care standards across the nation, positioning Saudi Arabia among global leaders in smart health care innovation.\\nBeyond clinical innovation, robotic-assisted surgery is making top-tier health care more accessible and cost-effective. In many medical centers, the cost of heart transplants has fallen by 40 percent compared to Western averages, boosting affordability without sacrificing quality. As medical tourism hubs adopt robotics, international patients gain access to advanced surgeries at lower costs, contributing to a 50 percent reduction in hospital stays, proven cost efficiency and patient satisfaction rates climbing to 92 percent.\\nAs health care enters this new era, robotics and AI are poised to become cornerstones of modern medicine. However, responsible implementation is essential. Hospitals must ensure robotic technologies enhance—not replace—human expertise, bolstered by robust ethical frameworks and clear accountability measures. Equally vital is ongoing workforce development through structured training, simulation-based exercises and cross-disciplinary workshops. The Kingdom has taken a proactive stance, investing in AI training, medical education and simulation-based surgical programs. Through the Human Capability Development Program (HCDP) and expanded digital health certifications, the Kingdom is preparing its health care workforce for the future. This approach—combining infrastructure investment with human capability development—positions Saudi Arabia as a leader in the future of AI-driven health care.\\nUltimately, in the race to health care robotics, success will be judged not by the sheer number of procedures performed, but by the lives saved. It falls to health care leaders to guide this transformation, ensuring that these remarkable innovations transcend technological achievement to truly improve lives and elevate the global standard of care.\\nH.E.

And their opinions are selling like hotcakes.\\nResearchers from the University of Zurich published a paper outlining an undisclosed artificial intelligence (AI) experiment conducted on r/changemyview, one of Reddit’s most popular subreddits. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), researchers deployed over one thousand AI-generated comments to, indeed, change user’s views. They tried three treatments: “generic,” “personalization,” and “community aligned.” Each yielded a “persuasive rate” between three and six times higher than human baseline.\\n“Importantly, all generated comments were reviewed by a researcher from our team to ensure no harmful or unethical content was published,” the researchers clarified. In fairness, they were only experimenting on Redditors. That’s not just a flippant comment — subreddits like r/changemyview select for some of the most ideologically rigid, least critically capable users available online. The site appears to have spent years culling users and forums that lean rightward. This study doesn’t prove AI is six times better than humans at persuasion so much as it suggests Reddit users are easily won over by emotional appeals. (RELATED: Think Finding The Truth Is Hard Now? It’s About To Get A Whole Lot Worse)\\nThe personalized bots examined the original poster’s last hundred posts and comments, using them to infer their sex, age, ethnicity, location, and politics.

      "async_langchain: 82, {'article': 'Page title: Salesforce takes aim at \\'jagged intelligence\\' in push for more reliable AI | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: Salesforce takes aim at ‘jagged intelligence’ in push for more reliable AI\\nSocial card description: Salesforce unveils groundbreaking AI research tackling \"jagged intelligence,\" introducing new benchmarks, models, and guardrails to make enterprise AI agents more intelligent, trusted, and consistently reliable for business use.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nSalesforce is tackling one of artificial intelligence’s most persistent challenges for business applications: the gap between an AI system’s raw intelligence and its ability to consistently perform in unpredictable enterprise environments — what the company calls “jagged intelligence.”\\nIn a comprehensive research announcement today, Salesforce AI Research revealed several new benchmarks, models, and frameworks designed to make future AI agents more intelligent, trusted, and versatile for enterprise use. The innovations aim to improve both the capabilities and consistency of AI systems, particularly when deployed as autonomous agents in complex business settings.\\n“While LLMs may excel at standardized tests, plan intricate trips, and generate sophisticated poetry, their brilliance often stumbles when faced with the need for reliable and consistent task execution in dynamic, unpredictable enterprise environments,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s Chief Scientist and Head of AI Research, during a press conference preceding the announcement.\\nThe initiative represents Salesforce’s push toward what Savarese calls “Enterprise General Intelligence” (EGI) — AI designed specifically for business complexity rather than the more theoretical pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\n“We define EGI as purpose-built AI agents for business optimized not just for capability, but for consistency, too,” Savarese explained. “While AGI may conjure images of superintelligent machines surpassing human intelligence, businesses aren’t waiting for that distant, illusory future. They’re applying these foundational concepts now to solve real-world challenges at scale.”\\nHow Salesforce is measuring and fixing AI’s inconsistency problem in enterprise settings\\nA central focus of the research is quantifying and addressing AI’s inconsistency in performance. Salesforce introduced the SIMPLE dataset, a public benchmark featuring 225 straightforward reasoning questions designed to measure how jagged an AI system’s capabilities really are.\\n“Today’s AI is jagged, so we need to work on that. But how can we work on something without measuring it first? That’s exactly what this SIMPLE benchmark is,” explained Shelby Heinecke, Senior Manager of Research at Salesforce, during the press conference.\\nFor enterprise applications, this inconsistency isn’t merely an academic concern. A single misstep from an AI agent could disrupt operations, erode customer trust, or inflict substantial financial damage.\\n“For businesses, AI isn’t a casual pastime; it’s a mission-critical tool that requires unwavering predictability,” Savarese noted in his commentary.\\nInside CRMArena: Salesforce’s virtual testing ground for enterprise AI agents\\nPerhaps the most significant innovation is CRMArena, a novel benchmarking framework designed to simulate realistic customer relationship management scenarios. It enables comprehensive testing of AI agents in professional contexts, addressing the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world business requirements.\\n“Recognizing that current AI models often fall short in reflecting the intricate demands of enterprise environments, we’ve introduced CRMArena: a novel benchmarking framework meticulously designed to simulate realistic, professionally grounded CRM scenarios,” Savarese said.\\nThe framework evaluates agent performance across three key personas: service agents, analysts, and managers. Early testing revealed that even with guided prompting, leading agents succeed less than 65% of the time at function-calling for these personas’ use cases.\\n“The CRM arena essentially is a tool that’s been introduced internally for improving agents,” Savarese explained. “It allows us to stress test these agents, understand when they’re failing, and then use these lessons we learn from those failure cases to improve our agents.”\\nNew embedding models that understand enterprise context better than ever before\\nAmong the technical innovations announced, Salesforce highlighted SFR-Embedding, a new model for deeper contextual understanding that leads the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across 56 datasets.\\n“SFR embedding is not just research. It’s coming to Data Cloud very, very soon,” Heinecke noted.\\nA specialized version, SFR-Embedding-Code, was also introduced for developers, enabling high-quality code search and streamlining development. According to Salesforce, the 7B parameter version leads the Code Information Retrieval (CoIR) benchmark, while smaller models (400M, 2B) offer efficient, cost-effective alternatives.\\nWhy smaller, action-focused AI models may outperform larger language models for business tasks\\nSalesforce also announced xLAM V2 (Large Action Model), a family of models specifically designed to predict actions rather than just generate text. These models start at just 1 billion parameters—a fraction of the size of many leading language models.\\n“What’s special about our xLAM models is that if you look at our model sizes, we’ve got a 1B model, we all the way up to a 70B model. That 1B model, for example, is a fraction of the size of many of today’s large language models,” Heinecke explained. “This small model packs just so much power in taking the ability to take the next action.”\\nUnlike standard language models, these action models are specifically trained to predict and execute the next steps in a task sequence, making them particularly valuable for autonomous agents that need to interact with enterprise systems.\\n“Large action models are LLMs under the hood, and the way we build them is we take an LLM and we fine-tune it on what we call action trajectories,” Heinecke added.\\nEnterprise AI safety: How Salesforce’s trust layer establishes guardrails for business use\\nTo address enterprise concerns about AI safety and reliability, Salesforce introduced SFR-Guard, a family of models trained on both publicly available data and CRM-specialized internal data. These models strengthen the company’s Trust Layer, which provides guardrails for AI agent behavior.\\n“Agentforce’s guardrails establish clear boundaries for agent behavior based on business needs, policies, and standards, ensuring agents act within predefined limits,” the company stated in its announcement.\\nThe company also launched ContextualJudgeBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judge models in context—testing over 2,000 challenging response pairs for accuracy, conciseness, faithfulness, and appropriate refusal to answer.\\nLooking beyond text, Salesforce unveiled TACO, a multimodal action model family designed to tackle complex, multi-step problems through chains of thought-and-action (CoTA). This approach enables AI to interpret and respond to intricate queries involving multiple media types, with Salesforce claiming up to 20% improvement on the challenging MMVet benchmark.\\nCo-innovation in action: How customer feedback shapes Salesforce’s enterprise AI roadmap\\nItai Asseo, Senior Director of Incubation and Brand Strategy at AI Research, emphasized the importance of customer co-innovation in developing enterprise-ready AI solutions.\\n“When we’re talking to customers, one of the main pain points that we have is that when dealing with enterprise data, there’s a very low tolerance to actually provide answers that are not accurate and that are not relevant,” Asseo explained. “We’ve made a lot of progress, whether it’s with reasoning engines, with RAG techniques and other methods around LLMs.”\\nAsseo cited examples of customer incubation yielding significant improvements in AI performance: “When we applied the Atlas reasoning engine, including some advanced techniques for retrieval augmented generation, coupled with our reasoning and agentic loop methodology and architecture, we were seeing accuracy that was twice as much as customers were able to do when working with kind of other major competitors of ours.”\\nThe road to Enterprise General Intelligence: What’s next for Salesforce AI\\nSalesforce’s research push comes at a critical moment in enterprise AI adoption, as businesses increasingly seek AI systems that combine advanced capabilities with dependable performance.\\nWhile the entire tech industry pursues ever-larger models with impressive raw capabilities, Salesforce’s focus on the consistency gap highlights a more nuanced approach to AI development — one that prioritizes real-world business requirements over academic benchmarks.\\nThe technologies announced Thursday will begin rolling out in the coming months, with SFR-Embedding heading to Data Cloud first, while other innovations will power future versions of Agentforce.\\nAs Savarese noted in the press conference, “It’s not about replacing humans. It’s about being in charge.” In the race to enterprise AI dominance, Salesforce is betting that consistency and reliability — not just raw intelligence—will ultimately define the winners of the business AI revolution.'}\n",

But these devices are real, developed by a startup co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and are now available in six U.S. cities.\\n“America should lead innovation, not fight it off,” said Altman yesterday (April 30) during an event unveiling the U.S. expansion of World, the digital identification project behind Orbs. The devices can now be found in seven locations cross Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco.\\nWorld is the brainchild of Tools for Humanity, a company established by Altman and deep learning researcher Alex Blania in 2019. Its mission is to establish a simple, secure form of human verification in a future where A.I. could blur the line between people and bots online.\\nInitially called Worldcoin and rebranded as World last year, the project aims to create a unique “World ID” for individuals—verifiable proof of personhood that can also be used for cryptocurrency transactions and other digital services.\\nWorld IDs are generated by scans from Orbs, which are currently available in nearly 900 locations worldwide, according to the World website. World aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, with the goal of reaching 180 million Americans. Globally, the project already claims 12 million verified World ID holders and ultimately aims for 1 billion users.\\nHow do the Orbs work?\\nHere’s how the Orbs work: the device takes about 30 seconds to scan a person’s irises, collecting data to generate a World ID and rewarding users with a small amount of the project’s WLD cryptocurrency. Powered by Nvidia (NVDA)’s Jetson chipset, the Orb measures iris patterns rather than more common biometric data like fingerprints, which are more susceptible to external changes.\\nFor the first time, Tools for Humanity will begin assembling some of its Orbs in the U.S., launching a domestic production line in Richardson, Texas. Following the initial rollout in its first six cities, the company plans to expand to Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas. “They will really be everywhere,” said Blania at the launch event. “They’ll be in gas stations, convenience stores—you’ll be able to verify yourself in 10 minutes, basically wherever you are.”\\nDespite its seemingly wacky premise, World has attracted the backing of major Silicon Valley investors. Since 2019, it has raised more than $240 million from firms including Andreessen Horowitz, khosla ventures, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, according to Crunchbase.\\nAlongside its U.S. expansion, World also announced two new partnerships aimed at advancing its digital ID vision. A collaboration with Visa will introduce the “World Card” later this year, allowing World ID holders to spend digital assets anywhere Visa is accepted. World is also partnering with Match Group to pilot World ID as an age verification tool for online dating platforms, starting with Tinder (MTCH) users in Japan.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 84, {'article': \"Page title: Hyperparam Open-Source\\nHyperparam Open-Source\\nHyperparam was founded to address a critical gap in the machine learning ecosystem: the lack of a user-friendly, scalable UI for exploring and curating massive datasets.\\nOur mission is grounded in the belief that data quality is the most important factor in ML success, and that better tools are needed to build better training sets. In practice, this means enabling data scientists and engineers to “look at your data” – even terabyte-scale text corpora – interactively and entirely in-browser without heavy infrastructure. By combining efficient data formats, high-performance JavaScript libraries, and emerging AI assistance, Hyperparam's vision is to put data quality front and center in model development. Our motto “the missing UI for AI data” reflects its goal to make massive data exploration, labeling, and quality management as intuitive as modern web apps, all while respecting privacy and compliance through a local-first design.\\nMission and Vision: Data-Centric AI in the Browser\\nOur mission is to empower ML practitioners to create the best training datasets for the best models. This stems from an industry-wide realization that model performance is ultimately bounded by data quality, not just model architecture or hyperparameters. Hyperparam envisions a new workflow where:\\n- Interactive Data Exploration at Scale: Users can freely explore huge datasets (millions or billions of records) with fast, free-form interactions to uncover insights. Unlike traditional Python notebooks that struggle with large data (often requiring downsampling or clunky pagination), Hyperparam leverages browser technology for a smooth UI.\\n- AI-Assisted Curation: Hyperparam integrates ML models to help label, filter, and transform data at a scale that would be impractical to review manually. By combining a highly interactive UI with model assistance, we make it possible for the user to use data to express exactly what they want from the model.\\n- Local-First and Private: Hyperparam runs entirely client-side, with no server dependency. This design not only simplifies setup (no complex pipeline or cloud needed) but also addresses enterprise compliance and security concerns, since sensitive data need not leave the user's machine. Fully browser-contained tools can bypass major adoption hurdles.\\nExperts across data engineering and MLOps widely agree on the need for better data exploration and labeling tools to tackle today's bottlenecks. We believe that the way to do that is to make data-centric AI workflows that are faster, easier to deploy, and more scalable – enabling users to iteratively improve data quality, which in turn yields better models.\\nThe Hyperparam OSS Universe\\nHyperparam delivers on our vision through a suite of open-source tools that tackle different aspects of data curation. These tools are built in TypeScript/JavaScript for seamless browser and Node.js usage.\\nWe care about performance, minimal dependencies, and standards compliance.\\nHyparquet: In-Browser Parquet Data Access\\nHyparquet is a lightweight, pure-JS library for reading Apache Parquet files directly in the browser. Parquet is a popular columnar format for large datasets, and Hyparquet enables web applications to tap into that efficiency without any server.\\nHyparquet allows data scientists to open large dataset files instantly in a browser UI for examination, without needing Python scripts, servers, or cloud databases. It's useful for quick dataset validation (e.g. checking a sample of a new data for quality issues) and for powering web-based data analysis tools. Because it's pure JS, developers can integrate Hyparquet into any web app or Electron application that needs to read Parquet. It is the core engine behind Hyperparam's own dataset viewer, enabling what was previously thought impossible: client-side big data exploration.\\n- Browser-Native & Dependency-Free: Hyparquet has zero external dependencies and is designed to run in both modern browsers and Node.js. At ~9.7 KB gzipped, it's extremely lightweight. It implements the full Parquet specification, aiming to be the “world's most compliant Parquet parser” that can open more files (all encodings and types) than other libraries.\\n- Efficient Streaming of Massive Data: Built with performance in mind, Hyparquet only loads the portions of data needed for a given query or view. It leverages Parquet's built-in indexing to fetch just the required rows or columns on the fly. This “load just in time” approach makes it feasible to interactively explore multi-gigabyte or even billion-row datasets in a web app.\\n- Complete Compression Support: Parquet files often use compression (Snappy, Gzip, ZSTD, etc.). Hyparquet by default handles common cases (uncompressed, Snappy), and with a companion library Hyparquet-Compressors, it supports all Parquet compression codecs. This is achieved with WebAssembly-optimized decompressors – notably HySnappy, a WASM Snappy decoder that accelerates parsing with minimal footprint.\\nHyparquet-Writer: Export Parquet Files from JavaScript\\nTo complement Hyparquet's reading capabilities, Hyparquet-Writer provides a way to write or export data to Parquet format in JavaScript. It is designed to be as lightweight and efficient as its reading counterpart.\\nAfter exploring or filtering a dataset with Hyperparam's tools, a user might want to save a subset or annotations. Hyparquet-Writer makes it possible to export those results in-browser as a Parquet file (or in Node.js without needing Python/Java libraries). This is valuable for creating shareable “refined datasets” or for moving data between systems while staying in Parquet (avoiding expensive CSV conversions).\\n- Fast Parquet Writing in JS: Hyparquet-Writer can take in JavaScript data (arrays of values per column) and output a binary Parquet file. It provides high efficiency and compact storage, so that even in-browser data manipulation results can be saved in a columnar format. It is especially efficient at representing sparse annotation data.\\n- Extreme Data Compression: Parquet can represent large datasets very efficiently. It is especially efficient at representing sparse annotation data, exactly what we need for annotating and curating datasets.\\n- Tiny and easy to deploy: Before Hyparquet-Writer the only way to write parquet files from the browser was huge wasm bundles (duckdb, datafusion). Hyparquet-Writer is less than 100kb of pure JavaScript, so it’s trivial to include with modern frontend applications.\\nHighTable: Scalable React Data Table Component\\nHighTable is a React-based virtualized table component for viewing extremely large tables in the browser. It is the UI workhorse that displays data fetched by Hyparquet or other sources.\\nHighTable is crucial for visual data exploration. In Hyperparam's dataset viewer, HighTable renders the content of Parquet files, allowing you to scroll through data that far exceeds memory limitations. You can also embed HighTable in custom web apps where a large results table is needed (for example, viewing logs, telemetry, or any big tabular data) without losing interactivity. By handling only what's visible, it bridges the gap between big data backends and a smooth front-end experience.\\nHighTable provides:\\n- Virtual Scrolling for Large Data: Instead of rendering thousands or millions of rows (which would choke the browser), HighTable only renders the rows in the current viewport, dynamically loading more as you scroll. This ensures smooth performance even with datasets that have millions of entries.\\n- Asynchronous Data Loading: HighTable works with a flexible data model that can fetch data on-the-fly. The table requests rows for a given range (e.g., 100–200) through a provided function. This means the data could come from an in-memory array, an IndexedDB store, or a remote source via Hyparquet. HighTable is agnostic as long as it can retrieve slices. This design allows infinite scrolling through data of “any size”.\\n- Rich Table Features: Despite focusing on scale, HighTable offers convenient features expected in a spreadsheet-like interface: optional column sorting, adjustable column widths, and event hooks (e.g., double-click on a cell). It even displays per-cell loading placeholders to indicate when data is being fetched, maintaining a responsive feel.\\nIcebird: JavaScript Apache Iceberg Table Reader\\nIcebird extends Hyperparam's reach into data stored in Apache Iceberg format. Iceberg is a popular table format for data lakes (often used on Hadoop/S3 storage) which contain Parquet files under the hood. Importantly, Iceberg allows you to efficiently evolve large datasets (add/remove rows, add columns, etc). Icebird is essentially a JavaScript Iceberg client that can read Iceberg table metadata and retrieve data files, built on top of Hyparquet.\\nIf you are using Data Lake/Lakehouse architectures, Icebird makes it possible to inspect large Iceberg tables without a big data engine. A data engineer can point Hyperparam's viewer at an S3 path of an Iceberg table and quickly peek at a few rows or columns for validation. This is dramatically simpler than launching Spark or Trino for a small inspection task. Icebird brings our “no backend” philosophy to another major data format.\\n- Iceberg Table Access: Given a pointer to an Iceberg table (for example, a directory or catalog entry on cloud storage), Icebird can read the table's schema and metadata, then use Hyparquet to read the actual parquet file fragments that make up the table. It supports Iceberg's features like schema evolution (rename columns) and position deletes, with a roadmap to cover more features as needed.\\n- Time Travel Queries: Icebird allows users to retrieve data from older snapshots of the dataset (a feature of Iceberg) by specifying a metadata version to read. This is useful for auditing changes in data over time or reproducing an experiment on a previous dataset state – all from a browser environment.\\nHyllama: Llama.cpp Model Metadata Parser\\nHyllama is a slightly different tool in Hyperparam's suite – it's focused on model files rather than dataset files. Specifically, Hyllama is a JavaScript library to parse llama.cpp .gguf\\nfiles (a format for LLaMA and related large language model weights) and extract their metadata.\\nHyllama's primary use case is to allow users to inspect an LLM model's content (architecture parameters, vocab size, layer counts, etc.) and potentially even query its listed tokens or other metadata in the browser. For instance, you can drag-and-drop a .gguf\\nmodel file onto a web page using Hyllama and quickly see what architecture and quantization it has, without running the model. You can use Hyllama to introspect model files easily or verify that model files match a datasets scheme expectations.\\n- Efficient Metadata Extraction: LLM model files in GGUF format can be tens of gigabytes, which is impractical to load entirely in memory. Hyllama is designed to read just the metadata (and tensor indexes) from the file without loading full weights, by using partial reads (e.g., reading the first few MBs that contain the header and index).\\n- No Dependencies & Web-Friendly: Like Hyparquet, Hyllama is dependency-free and can run in both Node and browser environments. For browser use, it suggests employing HTTP range requests to fetch just the needed bytes of a model file.\\nHyperparam CLI: Local Dataset Viewer\\nThe Hyperparam CLI ties everything together into a user-facing application. It is a command-line tool that, when run (npx hyperparam\\n), launches a local web application for dataset viewing. Essentially, it's a one-command way to spin up the Hyperparam browser UI on your own local data.\\n- Scalable Local Dataset Viewer: By running the CLI, users can point it to a file, folder, or URL containing data and open an interactive browser view. For example,\\nnpx hyperparam mydataset.parquet\\nwill open the Hyperparam web UI and display the contents of that Parquet file in a scrollable table. If a directory is given, it provides a file browser to pick a dataset. Under the hood, the CLI uses Node.js to serve the static app and utilizes Hyparquet/Icebird libraries (via a built-in API) to fetch data from local disk or remote URLs, then displays it with HighTable in the browser.\\nHow the Tools Work Together\\nHyperparam's suite of open-source tools is the backbone of a cohesive ecosystem tailored specifically for machine learning data workflows, enabling interactive exploration and management directly in the browser. By integrating efficient in-browser data handling (Hyparquet and Icebird), scalable visualization (HighTable), intuitive data export capabilities (Hyparquet-Writer), and model metadata inspection (Hyllama), we hope to show that there is a better way to build data-centric ML tools. We are releasing this work as open source because we believe that everyone benefits from having a strong ecosystem of AI data tools.\\nIf you find these free open source tools useful, please show it! We love GitHub Stars ⭐\\nEnter your email to hear about new Hyperparam tools and libraries:\"}\n",

Today’s investment brings Supio’s total funding to date to $91 million.\\nThe company specializes in personal injury and mass tort plaintiff law when multiple clients file a lawsuit. It provides software that combines purpose-built AI models with human expert verification to avoid hallucinations to increase the accuracy and reliability of legal AI.\\nAccording to the Supio, this has been valuable in litigation where precision and data are paramount, especially when vast amounts of unstructured data need to be processed, such as legal documents, medical documents, handwritten notes, claims and more.\\n“We’re building technology that doesn’t just save time, but fundamentally improves case outcomes,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Zhou.\\nCiting statistics from partner firms, Supio said its platform has led to significant improvements in win rates and case success.

The findings, detailed in a working paper by economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen, provide an early, large-scale empirical look at AI\\'s transformative potential.\\nIn \"Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects,\" economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard focused specifically on the impact of AI chatbots across 11 occupations often considered vulnerable to automation, including accountants, software developers, and customer support specialists. Their analysis covered data from 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark.\\nDespite finding widespread and often employer-encouraged adoption of these tools, the study concluded that \"AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation\" during the period studied. The confidence intervals in their statistical analysis ruled out average effects larger than 1 percent.\\n\"The adoption of these chatbots has been remarkably fast,\" Humlum told The Register about the study. \"Most workers in the exposed occupations have now adopted these chatbots... But then when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle.\"\\nAI creating more work?\\nDuring the study, the researchers investigated how company investment in AI affected worker adoption and how chatbots changed workplace processes. While corporate investment boosted AI tool adoption—saving time for 64 to 90 percent of users across studied occupations—the actual benefits were less substantial than expected.\\nThe study revealed that AI chatbots actually created new job tasks for 8.4 percent of workers, including some who did not use the tools themselves, offsetting potential time savings. For example, many teachers now spend time detecting whether students use ChatGPT for homework, while other workers review AI output quality or attempt to craft effective prompts.'}\n",

Add it all up, and it\\'s a vision of the future that gives Andreessen and his peers extraordinary power over everybody else.\\n\"After you die, VCs are the judges of whether you get into heaven or not,\" as one poster quipped on X-formerly-Twitter.\\nIn reality, whether AI will ever be able to replace a meaningful number of workers is a pretty open question. At present, the best AI isn\\'t capable of automating any but the most basic of tasks, and some experts argue it never will; it\\'s also easy to imagine an underwhelming future in which AI automates many roles sloppily, at the expense of quality work.\\nAnd in that case, Andreessen\\'s no common worker — the tech titan has hundreds of millions of dollars invested in AI startups like ElevenLabs, Figma, and Applied Intuition, making his prediction more than a little biased from the jump. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz, most recently announced the launch of a $20 billion megafund for AI startups, which would be the largest VC fund in history.\\nIf the \"AI takeover\" does come to pass, it\\'s hard to imagine that gigs like Andreessen\\'s would be spared. At the end of the day, all he really does is evaluate the financial outlooks of various startup ideas, which isn\\'t the easiest task to do well, but a far cry from punishing physical careers like nurses and loggers, or rarefied intellectual ones like scientists and teachers.\\nAndreessen\\'s decidedly selfish outlook is unfortunately well-regarded among the class of libertarian thinkers, techno capitalists and political pundits who parrot his ideas. His infamous tome, the \"Techno-Optimist\\'s Manifesto,\" lays out just who benefits from his AI revolution: \"We believe the techno-capital machine of markets and innovation never ends, but instead spirals continuously upward.\"\\nPut another way: there is infinite money to be mined from the workers of the world, and a special class of entrepreneurs will be the ones to do so, all in the name of innovation.\\nAs tech and economics researcher Jathan Sadowski observed in his recent book, \"The Mechanic and the Luddite\": \"This outcome can only be achieved to great effect by putting a highly concentrated industry that is driven by accumulating more money than god and enacting its own internalized savior complex in charge of your innovation system.\"\\nMore on venture capitalists: Investor Says AI Is Already \"Fully Replacing People\"\\nShare This Article'}\n",

The solution delivers real-time threat intelligence by continuously monitoring backup data and the systems connected to it, he added.\\n“If I look at what Veeam has brought to market, there are a couple of things I want to highlight,” Vanover said. “One is a technology that we have called Veeam Threat Hunter, and that is an iteration of something we’ve had for a long time. The thought is we are this incredible copy of the data, and the best part is, it’s not something that can interfere with production when organizations are running their workloads. We can actually connect the worlds of this incredible copy of data.”\\nVanover and Emilee Tallez (right), field chief technology officer at Veeam, spoke with theCUBE’s Christophe Bertrand at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how Veeam Threat Hunter tames cybersecurity risks. (* Disclosure below.)\\nHow Veeam Threat Hunter supports cyber resilience through data protection\\nThe link between Veeam Threat Hunter and cyber resilience lies in data protection and proactive threat detection. The solution supports cyber resilience by using a signature-based scan engine to detect malware, ransomware, and other anomalies in backup data, according to Vanover.\\n“I recommend to people all the time to take the backups with Veeam and then run a Veeam Threat Hunter scan right after that,” he said. “This is something that’s optimized for our use case. It is signature-based. If you talk to any incident response individual or some of the advanced threats, signatures aren’t the end-all be-all, but at least it’s a very important additional data point.”\\nArtificial intelligence enhances cyber resilience by improving risk management, threat detection and adaptive learning. Veeam has taken its first step in this direction with the launch of Veeam Guardian, according to Vanover.\\n“I’ll be the first to say, what I do not want to do is do AI washing,” he said. “I want the world to know that Veeam is taking a very practical, user benefit-first approach to AI. We announced a part of our vision, and it was showcased last week at VeeamON. [It’s] called Veeam Guardian. It’s solving one of those big problems with AI … being explainable and justifiable [so] that you can map it to the business. This is just one example of being able to talk to your data.”\\nA robust partner ecosystem is essential in cyber resilience because it strengthens an organization’s ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from cyber threats. Veeam is prioritizing partnerships for this very reason, according to Tallez.\\n“Every organization out there, they’re all taking the same approach, it’s defense in depth,” she said. “What Veeam wanted to do is make sure that customers that have already made those large investments into companies like CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, Splunk, et cetera, keep that investment [and] leverage the tool, but be able to bring data protection along with it. Veeam’s focused on building out the security ecosystem. We currently partner with over 65 security vendors, and we’re constantly adding more.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: Veeam Software Group GmbH sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

The tech industry has spent months pitching AI personal assistants that know what you want and can do real work on your behalf.\\nSo far, they\\'re not doing much.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nVisa hopes to change that by giving them your credit card. Set a budget and some preferences and these AI agents — successors to ChatGPT and its chatbot peers — could find and buy you a sweater, weekly groceries or an airplane ticket.\\n“We think this could be really important,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in an interview. “Transformational, on the order of magnitude of the advent of e-commerce itself.”\\nVisa announced Wednesday it is partnering with a group of leading AI chatbot developers — among them U.S. companies Anthropic, Microsoft, OpenAI and Perplexity, and France\\'s Mistral — to connect their AI systems to Visa\\'s payments network. Visa is also working with IBM, online payment company Stripe and phone-maker Samsung on the initiative. Pilot projects begin Wednesday, ahead of more widespread usage expected next year.\\nThe San Francisco payment processing company is betting that what seems futuristic now could become a convenient alternative to our most mundane shopping tasks in the near future. It has spent the past six months working with AI developers to address technical obstacles that must be overcome before the average consumer is going to use it.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nFor emerging AI companies, Visa\\'s backing could also boost their chances of competing with tech giants Amazon and Google, which dominate digital commerce and are developing their own AI agents.\\nThe tech industry is already full of demonstrations of the capabilities of what it calls agentic AI, though few are yet found in the real world. Most are still refashioned versions of large language models — the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.\\n“The early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,” Forestell said. “You get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, ‘OK, you go buy it.’\\nVisa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\n“The payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,\" Forestell said. “That’s why we started working with them.”\\nThe new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant.\\nMany consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone\\'s digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer\\'s behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes.\\nForestell said that doesn\\'t mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people — like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists — or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that “just powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,” Forestell said.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nOther shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background.\\nAnd what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York.\\nForestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to “go spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,\" he said.\\nPart of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer\\'s consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\n“Visa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity\\'s chief business officer. “When we generate a recommendation -- say you’re asking, ‘What are the best laptops?’ — we would know what are other transactions you’ve made and the revealed preferences from that.”\\nPerplexity\\'s chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it\\'s still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says. The San Francisco startup has also, along with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, told a federal court it would consider buying Google\\'s internet browser, Chrome, if the U.S. forces a breakup of the tech giant in a pending antitrust case.'}\n",

The company is now required to obtain a license from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security to sell the H20 and any other chips “achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof” to China, according to the filing.\\nSimilarly, a filing from AMD stated that the firm is now restricted from selling its MI308 GPU to China—and likely any chips that have equal or higher performance in the future. Intel’s artificial intelligence accelerator Gaudi will also be restricted under the new control threshold, which reportedly appears to limit chips with total DRAM bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or more, input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second or more, or a total of both of 1,700 GB per second or more.\\nThe possible new threshold not only restricts the advanced chips that were already controlled but also the less advanced chips from Nvidia, AMD, and other chipmakers, including Nvidia’s H20, AMD’s MI308X, and Intel’s Gaudi, which were used to comply with the export control threshold and intended primarily for sale in the Chinese market.\\nThe new restriction came roughly a week after NPR reported that the Trump administration had decided to back off on regulating the H20. Prior to that report, curbs on the H20 and chips with comparable performance had been widely anticipated by analysts on Wall Street, industry experts in Silicon Valley, and policy circles in Washington.\\nThe latest set of chip controls could be seen as following on from export restrictions during the Biden administration and as continuation of the Trump administration’s efforts to limit China’s access to advanced AI hardware. But the new measure carries far-reaching industry implications that could fundamentally reshape the landscape of China’s AI chip market.\\nThe impact of the new rule on the industry is profound. With the new controls, Nvidia is estimated to immediately lose about $15 billion to $16 billion, according to a J.P. Morgan analysis. AMD, on the other hand, faces $1.5 billion to 1.8 billion in lost revenue, accounting for roughly 10 percent of its estimated data center revenue this year.\\nYet the implications go beyond immediate financial damage. If the restriction persists, it will fundamentally reshape the Chinese AI chip market landscape and mark the start of a broader retreat for U.S. AI accelerators from China. That includes not only GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel but also firms providing application-specific integrated circuits—another type of chips targeting specific AI workloads, such as Google’s TPU and Amazon Web Servies’ Trainium.\\nThe new rule will make it nearly impossible for U.S. firms such as Nvidia and AMD to design and sell chips that are export-compliant and competitive in the Chinese market. That means these firms’ market share in the Chinese AI chip market will decline over time, as they are forced to withdraw almost all of their offerings of both advanced and less advanced chips while Chinese firms gradually capture the remaining market.\\nThe H20 and the upgraded H20E are already only marginally ahead of their Chinese competitors. Huawei’s latest AI chip Ascend 910C delivers 2.6 times the computational performance of the H20, although it offers 20 percent less memory bandwidth, which is vital for the inference training and reasoning models that are a key part of modern AI.\\nThe H20’s memory bandwidth, along with Nvidia’s widely adopted software stack, a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables efficient GPU utilization for AI, high-performance computing, and scientific workloads, have been key differentiators driving demand from Chinese AI firms and keeping them competitive in the Chinese market. China acquired more than 1 million units of the H20 in 2024 and has been stockpiling the chip in response to looming concerns about controls since early 2025.\\nThe narrowing gap between the H20 and Huawei’s 910C highlights the growing ability of Chinese AI chipmakers to meet domestic compute demand without foreign GPUs. As of today, Huawei’s 910C is in mass production, with units already delivered to customers and broader mass shipments reportedly starting in May. Most recently, Huawei is reportedly approaching customers about testing its enhanced version of the 910-series GPU—the 910D. Its next-generation chip—the Ascend 920—is expected to enter mass production in the second half of 2025.\\nNotably, Huawei is just one of many Chinese firms poised to fill the gap left by U.S. suppliers. Chinese AI chip companies such as Cambricon, Hygon, Enflame, Iluvatar CoreX, Biren, and Moore Threads are actively developing more competitive domestic AI chips to capture this expanding market.\\nOver the next few years, Chinese firms such as Alibaba, ByteDance, Baidu, and Tencent will likely continue to rely on existing inventories of Nvidia and AMD chips—such as the H100, H200, H800, and H20—acquired prior to the implementation of export controls. For example, ByteDance’s current GPU inventory in China is rumored to include 16,000-17,000 units of the A100, 60,000 units of the A800, and 24,000-25,000 units of the H800. Its overseas businesses likely have more than 20,000 units of the H100, 270,000 of the H20, and tens of thousands of cards such as the L20 and L40.\\nAdvanced chips, including the limited amount of Nvidia’s Blackwell-series GPUs, may also continue entering the Chinese market via illicit or gray-market channels, given the enduring performance advantage and wide adoption of these chips over most Chinese domestic alternatives. The Blackwell GPUs and other cutting-edge chips could still be sold legally to the oversea data centers of leading Chinese AI companies to potentially train their AI models.\\nSimilarly, other leading Chinese AI firms still possess significant chip stockpiles. Assuming export controls continue to restrict Chinese AI companies’ access to advanced computing resources, existing GPU inventories should still enable model development over the next several years. Typically, GPUs have a four- to five-year depreciation lifecycle, providing a window during which Chinese domestic GPU manufacturers can advance their capabilities and begin supplying more competitive chips to support domestic AI development.\\nUltimately, time is now on the Chinese firms’ side. As inventories of foreign GPUs gradually depreciate and become obsolete, Chinese firms are expected to shift toward and adopt more domestically produced AI chips to meet ongoing compute needs at a time when local chipmakers offer more powerful alternatives. China’s overall computing demand will steadily rise, given the continued advancement of the AI industry, and such incremental growth in demand will likely be met by Chinese AI chipmakers.\\nAs a result, the tens of billions of dollars in revenue that would have gone to Nvidia and AMD will be gradually captured by Chinese AI firms in the coming years. In a rough assessment, the latest ban causes Nvidia and AMD instant losses of about $16.5 billion to $17.8 billion—about 70 percent of what Huawei spent on research and development in 2024.\\nThis new market paradigm will not only strengthen the market position and financial sustainability of domestic Chinese AI chipmakers but also enhance their capacity to reinvest in R&D. In turn, this will accelerate innovation, improve competitiveness, and fortify China’s broader AI hardware supply chain—ultimately contributing to the long-term resilience and advancement of Chinese AI capabilities.\\nMore importantly, the growing domestic adoption of Chinese GPUs enables local firms to refine their products more efficiently through accelerated and larger feedback loops from local enterprises. As the Nvidia-led GPU ecosystem stalls and gradually retreats from the Chinese market, this shift creates space for local players to build a domestic GPU ecosystem—one that may increasingly lock out foreign competitors and raise re-entry barriers over time.\\nA total ban on the H20 would likely slow China’s short-term growth in AI compute capacity by removing a key source of advanced chips. But the medium- to longer-term impact is less clear. Chinese AI companies, as previously noted, remain very capable of developing their AI by using a large number of existing Nvidia and AMD GPUs for the next few years, alongside a growing supply of improving domestic alternatives. The U.S. leadership’s ultimate goal of using export controls to constrain China’s AI development remains uncertain, as the gap between the two countries’ AI model capabilities appears to be narrowing rather than widening.\\nWhat is clear, however, is the broader industry impact of the new controls. If sustained, they will mark the beginning of a major withdrawal of U.S. AI chipmakers from the Chinese market—paving the way for a significant boost to domestic Chinese AI chipmakers. In trying to isolate China, the United States may end up giving Chinese firms a leg up.\\nRay Wang is a Washington-based analyst formerly based in Taipei and Seoul.

The Equipment Installation Check feature can warn users if the support bracket slips or loosens over time,\" JPR president Jon Peddie wrote.\\nIt is understood an update to the Asus GPU Tweak utility enables the app to alert users if there has been any movement in the card that may point to a potential droop situation.

Meta\\'s entire business is essentially its family of apps – from Facebook to WhatsApp – which recorded $41.9 billion in revenue (up 16 percent year on year) and $21.8 billion in net income (up 23 percent) in the first three months of 2025.\\nMeanwhile, the aforementioned Reality Labs group, responsible for Meta\\'s various metacurse, er, verse and VR projects, wiped out a chunk of those profits.\\nThe unit\\'s $4.2 billion loss – steeper than the year-ago\\'s $3.8 billion loss – was still slightly better than Wall Street\\'s average forecast of $4.6 billion. However, sales of Reality Labs products like Quest VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses fell short, bringing in just $412 million versus the expected $493 million.\\nDespite those losses, which have topped $60 billion since the unit\\'s inception in 2020, Zuckerberg kept touting its potential for a long time, saying as recently as January\\'s Q4 2024 earnings call that 2025 was \"going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse.\"\\nThis week\\'s call sounded a change in tune.\\n\"The major theme right now of course is how AI is transforming everything we do,\" Zuck said on a conference call Wednesday with Wall Street following the release of his Q1 earnings.\\n\"As we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our resources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the five major opportunities that we\\'re focused on: improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.\"\\nThe metaverse didn\\'t get a single mention. True, \"AI devices\" technically covers headsets and smart glasses from Reality Labs, but the immersive virtual worlds that once drove Zuckerberg to rebrand the company have quietly disappeared from the spotlight.

It also includes initiatives like Meta\\'s AI glasses which is a material growth area for the company. So, yes, Reality Labs will continue should Meta jettison its metaverse projects that aren\\'t gaining traction.\"\\nThat said, he thinks AI will be the big new push in Zuckerworld. \"Unlike the metaverse, Meta has made demonstrable progress with AI and it\\'s benefiting people now,\" Proulx continued. \"It\\'s also helping to future proof Meta as a growth company should its family of apps get decimated by the current antitrust case.\"\\n- Meta bets you want a sprinkle of social in your chatbot\\n- Metaverses are flopping – hard – says Gartner\\n- Stargate, smargate.
