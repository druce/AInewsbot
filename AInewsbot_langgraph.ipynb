    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhoutee score\n"

      "Social card description: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.\n",

      "Social card description: We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.\n",

Human properties from Wikidata\\nB. Training parameters of entity recognizer\\nD. LLM probabilities: base models\\nE. Training size and performance\\n5 Privacy Risk Indicators\\nMany text sanitization approaches simply operate by masking all detected PII spans. This may, however, lead to overmasking, as the actual risk of re-identification may vary greatly from one span to another. In many documents, a substantial fraction of the detected text spans may be kept in clear text without notably increasing the reidentification risk. For instance, in the TAB corpus, only 4.4 % of the entities were marked by the annotators as direct identifiers, and 64.4 % as quasi-identifiers, thus leaving 31.2 % of the entities in clear text. To assess which text spans should be masked, we need to design privacy risk indicators able to determine which text spans (or combination of text spans) actually constitute a re-identification risk.\\nWe present 5 possible approaches for inferring the re-identification risk associated with text spans in a document. Those 5 indicators are respectively based on:\\n-\\nLLM probabilities,\\n-\\nSpan classification,\\n-\\nPerturbations,\\n-\\nSequence labelling,\\n-\\nWeb search.\\nThe web search approach can be applied in a zero-short manner without any finetuning. The two methods respectively based on LLM probabilities and perturbations require a small number of labeled examples to adjust a classification threshold or fit a simple binary classification model. Finally, the span classification and sequence labelling approaches operate by fine-tuning an existing language model, and are thus the methods that are most dependent on getting a sufficient amount of labeled training data to reach peak performance. This training data will typically take the form of human decisions to mask or keep in clear text a given text span.\\nWe present each method in turn and provide an evaluation and discussion of their relative benefits and limitations in Section 6.\\n5.1 LLM Probabilities\\nThe probability of a span as predicted by a language model is inversely correlated with its informativeness: a text span that is harder to predict is more informative/surprising than one that the language model can easily infer from the context (Zarcone et al., 2016). The underlying intuition is that text spans that are highly informative/surprising are also associated with a high re-identification risk, as they often correspond to specific names, dates or codes that cannot be predicted from the context.\\nConcretely, we calculate the probability of each detected PII span given the entire context of the text by masking all the (sub)words of the span, and returning a list with all log-probabilities (one per token) referring to the span as calculated by a large, bidirectional language model, in our case BERT (large, cased) (Devlin et al., 2019). Those probabilities are then aggregated and employed as features for a binary classifier that outputs the probability of the text span being masked by a human annotator.\\nThe list of log-probabilities for each span has a different length depending on the number of tokens comprised in the text span. We therefore aggregate this list by reducing it to 5 features, namely the minimum, maximum, median and mean log probability as well as the sum of log-probabilities in the list. In addition, we also include as feature an encoding of the PII type assigned to the span by the human annotators (see Table 1).\\nFor the classifier itself, we conduct experiments using a simple logistic regression model as well as a more advanced classification framework based on AutoML. AutoML (He et al., 2021) provides a principled approach to hyper-parameter tuning and model selection, efficiently searching for the hyper-parameters and model combination that yield the best performance. We use the Autogluon toolkit (Erickson et al., 2020) in our experiments, and more specifically AutoGluon’s Tabular predictor (Erickson et al., 2020), which consists of an ordered sequence of base models. After each model is trained and hyper-parameter optimization is performed on each, a weighted ensemble model is trained using a stacking technique. A list of all base models of the Tabular predictor is shown in Table 11, in Appendix D. We use the training splits of the Wikipedia biographies and the TAB corpus to fit the classifier.\\nThis paper is available on arxiv under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 2, {'article': \"Page title: [2504.16736] A Survey of AI Agent Protocols\\nSocial card title: A Survey of AI Agent Protocols\\nSocial card description: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to the widespread deployment of LLM agents across diverse industries, including customer service, content generation, data analysis, and even healthcare. However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this.

However, as more LLM agents are deployed, a major issue has emerged: there is no standard way for these agents to communicate with external tools or data sources. This lack of standardized protocols makes it difficult for agents to work together or scale effectively, and it limits their ability to tackle complex, real-world tasks. A unified communication protocol for LLM agents could change this. It would allow agents and tools to interact more smoothly, encourage collaboration, and triggering the formation of collective intelligence. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of existing agent protocols, proposing a systematic two-dimensional classification that differentiates context-oriented versus inter-agent protocols and general-purpose versus domain-specific protocols. Additionally, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of these protocols across key dimensions such as security, scalability, and latency. Finally, we explore the future landscape of agent protocols by identifying critical research directions and characteristics necessary for next-generation protocols. These characteristics include adaptability, privacy preservation, and group-based interaction, as well as trends toward layered architectures and collective intelligence infrastructures. We expect this work to serve as a practical reference for both researchers and engineers seeking to design, evaluate, or integrate robust communication infrastructures for intelligent agents.\\nSubmission history\\nFrom: Yingxuan Yang [view email][v1] Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:07:26 UTC (749 KB)\\n[v2] Sat, 26 Apr 2025 15:16:11 UTC (1,034 KB)\\nReferences & Citations\\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\\nDemos\\nRecommenders and Search Tools\\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The paper looked at professions like accountancy, IT support specialists, teaching, journalism, and software development, many of which have been tipped for an AI overhaul by famous faces like Bill Gates.\\nThe researchers said their findings “challenged narratives of imminent labor market transformation due to Generative AI.” The paper found that though AI produced modest productivity gains with an average time saving of 3% per worker—just a few hours in an average working month—this was actually counteracted by the new tasks created by AI.\\nAnders Humlum, an economist who worked on the study, thinks these lower-than-may-be-expected productivity gains may be due to the difficulty of applying AI directly to real-world tasks, at least without significant extra steps.\\n\"First, most tasks do not fall into that category where ChatGPT can just automate everything,\" he said in an interview with The Register.\\nAI chatbots reportedly created new job tasks for 8.4 percent of workers.\\n\"One very stark example that is close to home for me is there are a lot of teachers who now say they spend time trying to detect whether their students are using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework,\" said Humlum.\\nHumlum also pointed to how workers are spending significant amounts of time assessing the quality of AI output—for example, checking or debugging the code produced by a chatbot, or drafting prompts for AIs.\\nThis isn\\'t to say that workers are simply ignoring the potential of AI chatbots. Humlum said chatbot adoption has been \"remarkably fast\" in the professions they looked at, boosted by many employer initiatives, but that this \"really has not moved the needle\" when it comes to real-world outcomes by wages or employment features.\\nHowever, even if AI\\'s short-term impact on jobs and wages may not be world-changing in the short term, this is unlikely to change the pessimistic views of the average American. Only 23% of Americans predict AI will have a positive impact on how people do their jobs, compared to 73% of AI experts, according to Pew Center research, which surveyed 5,400 adults.\\nYour Daily Dose of Our Top Tech News\\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\\nRead the latest from Will McCurdy\\n- Report: Apple Eyes iPhone Release Schedule Shake-Up, Book-Style Foldable\\n- California Man Pleads Guilty to 2024 Disney Slack Hack\\n- Switch Won’t Turn On?

Maybe the job isn’t as fulfilling anymore. Maybe changing circumstances are pushing you toward a new path. Either way, figuring out what to do next can be a challenge.\\nIncreasingly, artificial intelligence is helping people explore their next steps—even when they’re unsure themselves. Chatbots like ChatGPT can offer some guidance, provided you know how to phrase your questions. But several companies have developed specialized tools that focus specifically on this issue.\\nGoogle is leading the pack with its Career Dreamer. Described as “a playful way to explore career possibilities with AI,” it’s a tool that anyone can use.\\nTo get started with Career Dreamer, you’ll develop a “career identity statement,” which outlines your skills and experiences. After sharing your current job, the AI will ask follow-up questions about what that role involved. You can also add details about your educational background and any careers, industries, or fields that interest you.\\nCareer Dreamer then suggests potential career paths based on your input. (For example, among its alternate career suggestions for me were communications/public relations specialist, communications professor, and market research analyst—along with several jobs in the reporting field.)\\nHovering your mouse over each suggested field provides information about the type of degree typically required, the experience you’ll generally need, a description of the job, and—if you click through—the average salary.\\nFind something that looks intriguing? You can click through to a list of local job opportunities or jump over to the Gemini AI tool to craft a résumé or cover letter.\\nLinkedIn, meanwhile, offers the Next Role Explorer for users whose companies subscribe to its Learning Hub. That tool showcases potential opportunities within the company, suggests skills employees should develop, and shows how many openings exist in each role. It also displays the percentage of people who have successfully transitioned from the employee’s current role to the new one.\\nAI, for that service, acts as a career coach, offering recommended courses and career paths. It also helps employees stay on track as they work toward acquiring the skills needed for a new role.\\nAt Salesforce, the company rolled out Career Connect last September—an internal talent marketplace that uses AI to help employees create personalized career paths tailored to their skills and aspirations.\\nThe tool is embedded in Salesforce’s Slack workflow. Employees can view roles they’re currently qualified for, as well as positions where their skills are easily transferable. If a job catches their interest, they can apply directly within Slack.\\nEarly results, Salesforce says, have been extremely positive: Ninety-one percent of the roles that were filled went to participants in the Career Connect pilot program who discovered those opportunities through the tool. During the three-month trial, 28% of participants applied for jobs via the platform.\\nGiven the ongoing fears that AI will take people’s jobs—freelance positions have already seen a 21% drop in demand—it’s somewhat reassuring to see it also being used to help people find them.\\nThe final deadline for Fast Company’s Brands That Matter Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT.

If that\\'s not enough, the rival AI hype/doom chatter online makes it hard to keep track of what\\'s really important. But we\\'ve sifted through it all to recap the most notable AI news of the week from the heavyweights like OpenAI and Google, as well as the AI ecosystem at large. Read our last recap, and check back next week for a new edition.\\nAnother week, another batch of AI news coming your way.\\nThis week, Meta held its inaugural LlamaCon event for AI developers, OpenAI struggled with model behavior, and LM Arena was accused of helping AI companies game the system. Congress also passed new laws protecting victims of deepfakes, and new research examines AI\\'s current and potential harms. Plus, Duolingo and Wikipedia have very different approaches to their new AI strategies.\\nWhat happened at Meta\\'s first LlamaCon\\nAt LlamaCon, Meta\\'s first conference for AI developers, the two big announcements were the launch of a standalone Meta AI app to compete more directly with ChatGPT and the Llama API, now in limited preview. Following reports that this was in the works, CEO Sam Altman once joked that maybe OpenAI should do its own social media app, but now that is reportedly happening for real.\\nWe also went hands-on with the new Llama-powered Meta AI app. For more details about Meta AI\\'s top features, read Mashable\\'s breakdown.\\nDuring LlamaCon\\'s closing keynote, Mark Zuckerberg interviewed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about a bunch of trends, ranging from agentic AI capabilities to how we should measure AI\\'s advancements. Nadella also revealed that up to 30 percent of Microsoft\\'s code is written by AI. Not to be outdone, Zuckerberg said he wants AI to write half of Meta\\'s code by next year.\\nChatGPT has safety issues, goes shopping\\nMeta AI and ChatGPT both got busted this week for sexting minors.\\nOpenAI said this was a bug and they\\'re working to fix it. Another ChatGPT issue this week made the latest GPT-4o update too much of a suck-up. Altman described the model\\'s behavior as \"sycophant-y and annoying,\" but users were concerned about the dangers of releasing a model like this, highlighting problems with iterative deployment and reinforcement learning.\\nOpenAI was even accused of intentionally tuning the model to keep users more engaged. Joanne Jang, OpenAI\\'s head of model behavior, jumped on a Reddit AMA to do damage control. \"Personally, the most painful part of the latest sycophancy discussions has been people assuming that my colleagues are irresponsibly trying to maximize engagement for the sake of it,\" wrote Jang.\\nEarlier in the week, OpenAI announced new features to make products mentioned in ChatGPT responses more shoppable. The company said it isn\\'t earning purchase commissions, but it smells an awful lot like the beginnings of a Google Shopping competitor. Did we mention OpenAI would buy Chrome if Google is forced to divest it? Because they totally would, FYI.\\nThe ChatGPT maker has had a few more problems with its recent models. Last week, we reported that o3 and o4-mini hallucinate more than previous models, by OpenAI\\'s own admission.\\nAnyone in the U.S. can now sign up for Google AI Mode\\nMeanwhile, Google is barreling ahead with AI-powered search features. On Thursday, the tech giant announced that it\\'s removing the waitlist to test out AI Mode in Labs, so anyone over 18 in the U.S. can try it out. We spoke with Robby Stein, VP of product for Google Search, about how users have responded to its AI features, the future of search, and Google\\'s responsibility to publishers.\\nGoogle also updated Gemini with image editing tools and expanded NotebookLM, its AI podcast generator, to over 50 languages. Bloomberg also reported that Google has been quietly testing ads inside third-party chatbot responses.\\nWe\\'re keeping a close eye on that final development, and we are very curious how Google plans to inject ads into AI search. Would you trust a chatbot that gave you sponsored answers?\\nLeaderboard drama\\nResearchers from AI company Cohere, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2, published a paper this week calling out Chatbot Arena for essentially helping AI heavyweights rig their benchmarking results. The study said the popular crowdsourced benchmarking tool from UC Berkeley allowed Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Amazon \"extensive private testing\" and gave them more prompt data, which \"significantly\" improved their rankings.\\nIn response, LM Arena, the group behind Chatbot Arena said \"there are a number of factual errors and misleading statements in this writeup\" and posted a pointy-by-point rebuttal to the paper\\'s claims on X.\\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\\nThe issue of benchmarking AI models has become increasingly problematic. Benchmark results are largely self-reported by the companies that release them, and the AI community has called for more transparency and accountability by objective third parties. Chatbot Arena seemed to provide a solution by allowing users to choose the best responses in blind tests. But now LM Arena\\'s practices have come into question, further fueling the conversation around objective evaluations.\\nA few weeks ago, Meta got in trouble for using an unreleased version of its Llama 4 Maverick model on LM Arena, which scored a high ranking. LM Arena updated its leaderboard policies, and the publicly available version of Llama 4 Maverick was added instead, ranking way lower than the unreleased version.\\nLastly, LM Arena recently announced plans to form a company of its own.\\nRegulators and researchers tackle AI\\'s real-world harms\\nNow that generative AI has been in the wild for a few years, the real-world implications have started to crystallize.\\nThis week, U.S. Congress passed the \"Take It Down\" Act, which requires tech companies to remove nonconsensual intimate imagery within 48 hours of a request. The law also outlines strict punishment for deepfake creators. The legislation had bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by President Donald Trump.\\nThe nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report on generative AI\\'s impact on humans and the environment. The conclusion is that the potential impacts are huge, but exactly how much is unknown because \"private developers do not disclose some key technical information.\"\\nAnd in the realm of the frighteningly real and specific harms of AI, a study from Common Sense Media said AI companion apps like Character.AI and Replika are unequivocally unsafe for teens. The researchers say if you\\'re too young to buy cigarettes, you\\'re too young for your own AI companion.\\nThen there was the report that researchers from the University of Zurich secretly deployed AI bots in the r/changemyview subreddit to try and convince people to change their minds. Some of the bot identities included a statutory rape victim, \"a trauma counselor specializing in abuse,\" and \"a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter.\"\\nOther AI news...\\nIn other news, Duolingo is taking an \"AI-first\" approach, which means replacing its contract workers with AI whenever possible. On the flip side, Wikipedia announced it\\'s taking a \"human-first\" approach to its AI strategy. It won\\'t replace its volunteers and editors with AI, but will instead \"use AI to build features that remove technical barriers to allow the humans at the core of Wikipedia.\"\\nYelp deployed a bunch of AI features this week, including an AI-powered answering service that takes calls for restaurants, and Governor Gavin Newsom wants to use genAI to solve California\\'s legendary traffic jams.\\nTopics Artificial Intelligence OpenAI'}\n",

What is the path to reaching AGI? Here's an AI insider analysis.\\nIn today’s column, I examine the most likely pathways to get us from today’s contemporary AI to the vaunted AGI (artificial general intelligence). This is a mighty big open question and there are AI makers and humongous tech firms all making bets on which path will be the winner-winner chicken dinner when it comes to attaining AGI.\\nLet’s talk about it.\\nThis analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI, including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).\\nHeading Toward AGI And ASI\\nFirst, some fundamentals are required to set the stage for this weighty discussion.\\nThere is a great deal of research going on to further advance AI. The general goal is to either reach artificial general intelligence (AGI) or maybe even the outstretched possibility of achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI).\\nAGI is AI that is considered on par with human intellect and can seemingly match our intelligence. ASI is AI that has gone beyond human intellect and would be superior in many if not all feasible ways. The idea is that ASI would be able to run circles around humans by outthinking us at every turn. For more details on the nature of conventional AI versus AGI and ASI, see my analysis at the link here.\\nWe have not yet attained AGI.\\nIn fact, it is unknown as to whether we will reach AGI, or that maybe AGI will be achievable in decades or perhaps centuries from now. The AGI attainment dates that are floating around are wildly varying and wildly unsubstantiated by any credible evidence or ironclad logic. ASI is even more beyond the pale when it comes to where we are currently with conventional AI.\\nStrawman Dates On Attaining AGI\\nSince attaining AGI seems to be a greater chance in the relatively near-term versus achieving ASI, let’s put our minds to trying to foresee how AGI is going to be reached. I will use some strawman dates to help illuminate the murky matter.\\nRecent surveys of AI specialists indicate that the overall guess is that the year 2040 will be the presumed date by which AGI will have been accomplished. Numerous AI luminaries are touting that we will arrive at AGI sooner, such as in the next 3 to 5 years from today, thus they are staking their brazen claims on the years 2028 to 2030. I find this to be doubtful. They are also using Jedi mind tricks to twist the definition of AGI into being a lot less than what AGI is really supposed to denote, which helps to bolster their emboldened date forecasts. For my analysis of the various predicted dates and assorted definitions of AGI, see the link here.\\nThe strawman we will use here is the year 2040. That gives us a runway of 15 years. It is useful to put some thought into how those fifteen years are going to play out.\\nTimeline Considerations\\nAs you well know, we are currently sitting just about mid-way through the year 2025. Trying to envision arriving at AGI in the year 2040 seems like a daunting task. It is quite a long distance in time from our present-day AI status.\\nNo worries, we will do a divide-and-conquer approach to see what we can come up with.\\nOne possibility is that the advances in AI occur smoothly on a year-by-year basis which ultimately culminates in AGI. Assume that each year there is an incremental advancement, and the advancement is roughly the same amount of progression each year. In other words, if we improve AI by about 7% per year, doing so over roughly 15 years, AGI will become a reality by 2040 (I’m using rounded numbers for this thought exercise).\\nSome AI prognosticators believe that simply incrementing AI each year is not the ticket to success. Their view is that the current methodologies and practices are not going to scale up. Concerns are that everyone in AI is pretty much part of a massive one-way-fits-all mindset, blindly pursuing the same kinds of algorithms and approaches. Only if we break free of this malaise and come up with radically new ideas will AGI be attained. For more on this AI progression heated debate, see my coverage at the link here.\\nThe Bet On A Miracle\\nHere’s what vocal critics of the incremental approach say is potentially going to happen. Their hope is pinned on the idea that an enterprising AI developer will miraculously see beyond the bounds of existing AI and derive a groundbreaking new approach that no one has yet even imagined. This breakthrough will be the Holy Grail that gets us to AGI. Shortly after inventing or figuring out this incredible innovation, AGI will be right around the corner.\\nConsider how this gives a different perspective on the timeline.\\nMaybe the incremental approach muddles along for a dozen years. Some progress is being made, and ongoing self-congratulations are occurring. But AGI doesn’t seem within view. Investors in this AI are getting perturbed and asking hard questions about when AGI is finally going to be had.\\nBoom, out of nowhere, the enterprising AI developer comes up with an incredible breakthrough, doing so around year 13 or 14. Then, this breakthrough is rapidly nursed into becoming AGI.\\nIn that scenario, there are twelve years of modest incremental progress that is then suddenly punctuated by a new way of devising AI. Once that occurs, in relatively short order the vaunted AGI is figured out. Variations on that timeline are roughly the same in the sense that over the fifteen years, there is a sudden transformative eureka about AI that puts AGI in the picture. Perhaps this happens in year 10 instead of year 13. Or maybe it occurs at the last moment, arising in year 14.\\nA disconcerting problem with that timeline is that it is a bet on a kind of miracle occurring during the AGI pursuit. You might have seen a popular cartoon of two scientists standing at a chalkboard that is filled with arcane equations, and in the middle of the chalkboard, there is a noticeable gap. One scientist asks the other one, what goes in that gap? The response is that a miracle goes in that spot.\\nSeven Major Pathways\\nI’ve come up with seven major pathways that AI is going to advance to become AGI. The first listed path is the incremental progression trail. The AI industry tends to refer to this as the linear path. It is essentially slow and steady. The idea of a sudden miracle happening is usually coined as the moonshot path. Besides those two avenues, there are five more.\\nHere’s my list of all seven major pathways getting us from contemporary AI to the treasured AGI:\\n- (1) Linear path (slow-and-steady): This AGI path captures the gradualist view, whereby AI advancement accumulates a step at a time via scaling, engineering, and iteration, ultimately arriving at AGI.\\n- (2) S-curve path (plateau and resurgence): This AGI path reflects historical trends in the advancement of AI (e.g., early AI winters), and allows for leveling-up via breakthroughs after stagnation.\\n- (3) Hockey stick path (slow start, then rapid growth): This AGI path emphasizes the impact of a momentous key inflection point that reimagines and redirects AI advancements, possibly arising via theorized emergent capabilities of AI.\\n- (4) Rambling path (erratic fluctuations): This AGI path accounts for heightened uncertainty in advancing AI, including overhype-disillusionment cycles, and could also be punctuated by externally impactful disruptions (technical, political, social).\\n- (5) Moonshot path (sudden leap): Encompasses a radical and unanticipated discontinuity in the advancement of AI, such as the famed envisioned intelligence explosion or similar grand convergence that spontaneously and nearly instantaneously arrives at AGI (for my in-depth discussion on the intelligence explosion, see the link here).\\n- (6) Never-ending path (perpetual muddling): This represents the harshly skeptical view that AGI may be unreachable by humankind, but we keep trying anyway, plugging away with an enduring hope and belief that AGI is around the next corner.\\n- (7) Dead-end path (AGI can’t seem to be attained): This indicates that there is a chance that humans might arrive at a dead-end in the pursuit of AGI, which might be a temporary impasse or could be a permanent one such that AGI will never be attained no matter what we do.\\nYou can apply those seven possible pathways to whatever timeline you want to come up with. I used the fifteen years of reaching AGI in 2040 as an illustrative example. It could be that 2050 is more likely and this will play out over 25 years. If 2028 is going to be the AGI arrival year, the pathway is going to be markedly compressed.\\nPlacing Your Bets\\nHow does a belief in one pathway over another pathway shape the placing of your bets?\\nIf the linear path is where you are putting your poker chips, it would seem that all that needs to happen is to continue doing what is already being done right now. Keep the ship steady and presumably on course. Don’t let anything distract from that direction.\\nThe sudden leap to AGI via the moonshot path would appear to necessitate a maverick departure from what is being done at this time. Do whatever is feasible to think outside the prevailing box. Fund those wild and wide-eyed new ideas. Nurture them along and do not let the myopic pressures of others convince you otherwise.\\nSimilar strategies apply to each respective pathway.\\nI’m betting you are avidly curious as to which of the seven pathways is thought to be the most likely. In addition, you might be mildly interested in which of the seven is seen as the least likely.\\nIn talking with many of my fellow AI researchers, a casual and highly informal sense is that the S-curve is the most likely. This generally aligns with high-tech development curves. It also abides by the belief that what we are doing now isn’t going to scale up. During a period of a plateau, some new change is going to nudge us forward and open the door to scaling up. It won’t be a miracle breakthrough. Instead, ingenuity and novelty will help move the needle.\\nWhich of the seven pathways suits your fancy?\\nIn terms of the least likely of the pathways, the same ad hoc semblance of AI colleagues speculates that the moonshot won’t be the rescuer to get us to AGI. In their minds, the miracle cure gets worse odds than lighting striking you while a meteor lands on your head. Maybe this skepticism reflects a belief that what we know is what we know and that there isn’t something else extraordinary that we haven’t yet devised.\\nI certainly don’t want that sentiment to dampen any AI innovators from stretching boundaries and trying outsized new ideas. Please keep your spirit strong. Do not let naysayers stop you from your heart’s pursuit.\\nAs the famous American art historian remarked: “Miracles happen to those who believe in them.” The same might happen with attaining AGI.\"}\n",

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers.

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company.

While some see their potential as automated tutors, others worry that inaccuracies and hallucinations could harm student learning. Thisstudy assesses ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and o1preview) across important dimensions of student learning by evaluating their capabilities and limitations to serve as a non-interactive, automated tutor. In particular, we analyse performance in two tasks commonly used in principles of economics courses: explaining economic concepts and answering multiple-choice questions. Our findings indicate that newer models generate very accurate responses, although some inaccuracies persist. A key concern is that ChatGPT presents all responses with full confidence, making errors difficult for students to recognize. Furthermore, explanations are often quite narrow, lacking holistic perspectives, and the quality of examples remains poor. Despite these limitations, we argue that ChatGPT can serve as an effective automated tutor for basic, knowledge-based questionsâ€”supportingstudents while posing a relatively low risk of misinformation. Educators can hence recommend Generative AI chatbots for student learning, but should teach students the limitations of the technology.\\nDate: 2025-04-02\\nNew Economics Papers: this item is included in nep-ain\\nReferences: Add references at CitEc\\nCitations:\\nDownloads: (external link)\\nhttp://www.bristol.ac.uk/efm/media/workingpapers/w ... pdffiles/dp25786.pdf (application/pdf)\\nRelated works:\\nThis item may be available elsewhere in EconPapers: Search for items with the same title.\\nExport reference: BibTeX\\nRIS (EndNote, ProCite, RefMan)\\nHTML/Text\\nPersistent link: https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bri:uobdis:25/786\\nAccess Statistics for this paper\\nMore papers in Bristol Economics Discussion Papers from School of Economics, University of Bristol, UK\\nBibliographic data for series maintained by Vicky Jackson (vicky.jackson@bristol.ac.uk).'}\n",

The Series B raise closed at a $205 million valuation.\\n“We’ll use these funds to double down on our core products, serve the rapidly growing demand from enterprises across all sectors, and build the first social engineering defense platform,” said Doppel Chief Executive Officer Kevin Tian.\\nPhishing emails are usually disguised to look as if they were sent by a legitimate company. Other types of hacking campaigns sometimes employ similar methods. A malicious shopping app, for example, might attempt to impersonate a popular retail brand. Doppel provides a platform that helps companies detect when a hacker impersonates them and take down the infrastructure being used to do so.\\nIn addition to phishing emails and lookalike apps, Doppel spots social engineering campaigns that unfold on e-commerce platforms. Its platform can detect attempts to sell counterfeit goods under a legitimate company’s brand. Doppel likewise spots online ads that impersonate established brands to trick users into clicking them.\\nAnother set of features spots phishing links designed to resemble a legitimate company’s website URL. According to Doppel, it spots malicious links with the help of honeypots. A honeypot is a system that draws cyberattacks with the goal of collecting technical data about them.\\nIn some cases, phishing emails are noticed by the users they target earlier than by the automated systems that companies deploy to spot such threats. Doppel provides a tool that enables customers to notify a company when they receive a phishing email that impersonates its brand. A second tool, Employee AbuseBox, allows enterprises to provide similar phishing reporting features for their workers.\\nWhen users report a malicious email, Doppel analyzes its contents along with any links and attachments it may include. The company uses this information to track down the infrastructure that powers the phishing campaign. From there, Doppel sends takedown requests to the companies that host the infrastructure.\\nThe software maker says that its platform doubles as a dark web monitoring tool. Using Doppel, a company can monitor hacker websites for information about malicious activity that targets its infrastructure. The software can also spot data theft attempts that target an organization’s executives.\\nUnder the hood, Doppel detects malicious activity by analyzing about 100 million security data points per day. It processes the data using large language models from OpenAI. The company says that the median amount of time it takes customers to take down social engineering campaigns detected by its platform is about ten hours.\\nDoppel’s latest funding round comes 15 months after its Series A raise. According to the company, its annual recurring revenue has tripled since thanks to a combination of new customer acquisition and increased spending on the part of existing users.\\nImage: Pixabay\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\\nJoin our community on YouTube\\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\\nTHANK YOU'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 15, {'article': 'Page title: The AI jobs crisis is here, now - by Brian Merchant\\nSocial card title: The AI jobs crisis is here, now\\nSocial card description: It\\'s not coming, it has already arrived.\\nOn Monday, April 29th, Luis von Ahn, the billionaire CEO of the popular language learning app Duolingo, made a public announcement that his company is officially \"going to be AI-first.” Duolingo, von Ahn wrote in an email to all employees that was also posted to LinkedIn, will “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.” The CEO took pains to note that “this isn’t about replacing Duos with AI.”\\nAccording to one such Duolingo contractor, this is not accurate. For one thing, it’s not a new initiative. And it absolutely is about replacing workers: Duolingo has already replaced up to 100 of its workers—primarily the writers and translators who create the quirky quizzes and learning materials that have helped stake out the company’s identity—with AI systems. Duolingo isn’t “going to be” an AI-first company; it already is. The translators were laid off in 2023, the writers six months ago, in October 2024.\\n“It was very sudden when it happened,” the worker, a writer who spent years working at the company, told me on the condition of anonymity. They said it was “shocking” when they got the news. “We had been working with their AI tool for a while, and it was absolutely not at the point of being capable of writing lessons without humans.” They’d been told to stop working new content to help train the system, the writer says.\\n“If you had asked me a year ago, I would have told you that my job would become more and more editing AI content,” the writer told me. “I did not expect to be replaced so soon.”\\nThis is a glimpse of the AI jobs crisis that is unfolding right now—not in the distant future—and that’s already more pervasive than we might think. Before we dig in further, Blood in the Machine is a 100% reader-supported publication. Its existence depends entirely on the paying subscribers who chip in a few bucks a month, or $60 a year, so I can do this reporting and writing. If you can, please do consider becoming a paid supporter—many thanks, I’m so grateful to all of you.\\nThe Duolingo writer is far from alone. Almost every professional artist or illustrator I meet tells me they have lost clients and gigs to firms that have turned to AI instead of paying for human work; some have been pushed out of their fields altogether. I’ve written for WIRED about managers who are using AI to displace artists and designers in the video game industry. Voice actors have been on strike for 9 months now, seeking protections from corporations that would use AI to clone their voices. Just this week, the popular gaming website Polygon was sold off to the content farm Valnet that’s often accused of running AI-generated articles—almost all of Polygon’s human staff was fired.\\nIt’s unclear whether these kinds of layoffs are enough to register in the economic data, though there are signs it is. Writing in the Atlantic this week, business journalist and abundist Derek Thompson points to an alarming phenomenon in the job market: The unemployment rate for recent college graduates is unusually high—and historically high in relation to the general unemployment rate. Why might that be? One theory: Firms are hiring fewer grads into white collar jobs, and using more AI. “When you think from first principles about what generative AI can do, and what jobs it can replace, it’s the kind of things that young college grads have done,” as the Harvard economist David Deming told Thompson.\\nYoung grads are typically among the easiest to employ; they’re skilled, ambitious, and will work for cheap. Yet the recent grad-gap—the “difference between the unemployment of young college graduates and the overall labor force”—is higher than it’s been in four decades. Thompson points to the following graph, made with data from the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics:\\nHere’s Thompson:\\nThe strong interpretation of this graph is that it’s exactly what one would expect to see if firms replaced young workers with machines. As law firms leaned on AI for more paralegal work, and consulting firms realized that five 22-year-olds with ChatGPT could do the work of 20 recent grads, and tech firms turned over their software programming to a handful of superstars working with AI co-pilots, the entry level of America’s white-collar economy would contract.\\nFurthermore, as Thompson and others have noted, the Trump tariffs and trade wars could exacerbate the situation. Recessions hand more power to employers, who at least threaten and sometimes do invest in automation technologies like enterprise AI. “And even if employers aren’t directly substituting AI for human workers,” Thompson notes, “high spending on AI infrastructure may be crowding out spending on new hires.”\\nOne of the biggest questions—perhaps the big question—that has persistently circled the AI boom is how it will impact our working lives and jobs more broadly. Will AI lead to a jobs crisis? Poll after poll has found that it’s the top concern that people have with AI: That AI will take jobs and make our working lives worse. To an extent, the big AI companies encourage this line. OpenAI, Anthropic, and its competitors are selling a brand of automation software whose key value proposition is that it can replace tasks and workers to slash labor costs.\\nWell, I have bad news. The AI jobs crisis has arrived. It’s here, right now. It just doesn’t look quite like many expected it to.\\nThe AI jobs crisis does not, as I’ve written before, look like sentient programs arising all around us, inexorably replacing human jobs en masse. It’s a series of management decisions being made by executives seeking to cut labor costs and consolidate control in their organizations. The AI jobs crisis is not any sort of SkyNet-esque robot jobs apocalypse—it’s DOGE firing tens of thousands of federal employees while waving the banner of “an AI-first strategy.”\\nThe AI jobs crisis is not the sudden displacement of millions of workers in one fell swoop—instead, it’s evident in the attrition in creative industries, the declining income of freelance artists, writers, and illustrators, and in corporations’ inclination to simply hire fewer human workers.\\nThe AI jobs crisis is, in other words, a crisis in the nature and structure of work, more than it is about trends surfacing in the economic data. The AI boom, driven by OpenAI and Silicon Valley’s relentless talk of AGI and promotion of enterprise AI software and AI influencers enthusing over endless productivity gains, has been a powerful enabler of corporate automation and cost-cutting imperatives. These imperatives have always existed, of course; bosses have historically tried to maximize profits by using cost-cutting technologies. But generative AI has been uniquely powerful in equipping them with a narrative with which to do so—and to thus justify degrading, disempowering, or destroying vulnerable jobs.\\nDOGE is a good example. Elon Musk and the Trump administration’s project to hollow out the federal workforce is fueled by “AI-first strategies” and obtuse descriptions of algorithms and efficiency; it’s presented as a cost-cutting initiative aimed at generating efficiencies—yet it’s destroying livelihoods en masse and eroding institutional knowledge.\\nPatrick Kigongo, a former employee of 18F—the widely respected government agency that provided digital services across the federal government before it was dismantled wholesale by DOGE—says that this is essentially what the agency is doing. “They’re pointing at the AI hype machine and trying to apply that to government,” he said at a meeting of federal workers and academics resisting AI and DOGE in Washington DC. “They’re overpromising and doomed to underdeliver. The AI tools they’re promoting do not exist yet.”\\nDOGE is empowered by the logic of a generative AI enterprise product. It promises efficiency and techno-solutionism, but delivers results that are unreliable at best, and dangerous at worst. Consider DOGE’s laying off of nuclear regulators by mistake before recalling them back to work. Or its winnowing of federal food safety inspectors, soil surveyors, consumer protection advocates. Or its gutting of NASA, of the CDC, of the funding for scientific research everywhere, while Musk installs StarLink in the White House and positions his companies to pick up more state contracts.\\nThis is the AI jobs crisis. It’s DOGE boosting its chatbots, cost-cutting algorithms and hastily installed AI systems designed to replace personnel and the administering of regulations, while eliminating tens of thousands of federal workers, technologists, scientists, and civil servants.\\nMore broadly applied, the AI jobs crisis is billionaires, executives, and managers are using the gen AI logic to take aim at these kinds of jobs with renewed vigor; ie, those jobs that do not exist expressly to help them maximize profits.\\nI’ve been rereading the late anthropologist David Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs, which persuasively makes the case that the corporate world is happy to nurture inefficient or wasteful jobs if they somehow serve the managerial class or flatter elites—while encouraging the public to harbor animosity at those who do rewarding work or work that clearly benefits society. I think we can expect AI to accelerate this phenomenon, and to help generate echelons of new dubious jobs—prompt engineers, product marketers, etc—as it erodes conditions for artists and public servants.\\nA common refrain about modern AI is that it was supposed to automate the dull jobs so we could all be more creative, but instead, it’s being used to automate the creative jobs. That’s a pretty good articulation of what lies at the heart of the AI jobs crisis. Take the former Duolingo worker who was laid off as part of the company’s pivot to AI.\\n“So much will be lost,” the writer told me. “I was a content writer, I wrote the questions that learners see in the lessons. I enjoyed being able be creative. We were encouraged to make the exercises fun.” Now, consider what it’s being replace with, per the worker:\\n“First, the AI output is very boring. And Duolingo was always known for being fun and quirky. Second, it absolutely makes mistakes. Even on things that you would think it could get right. The AI tools that are available for people who pay for Duolingo Max often get things wrong—they have an ‘explain my mistake’ tool that often will suggest something that’s incorrect, sometimes the robot voices are programmed to speak the wrong language.”\\nThis is just a snapshot, too. This is happening, to varying degrees, to artists, journalists, writers, designers, coders—and soon, perhaps already, as Thompson’s story points out, it could be happening to even more jobs and lines of work.\\nNow, it needs to be underlined once again that generative AI is not yet the one-size-fits-all agent of job replacement its salesmen would like it to be—far from it. A recent SalesForce survey reported on by the Information show that only one-fifth of enterprise AI buyers are seeing good results, and that 61% of respondents report a disappointing return on investment for AI or even none at all.\\nGenerative AI is still best at select tasks that do not require consistent reliability—hence its purveyors taking aim at art and creative industries. But all that’s secondary. The rise of generative AI, linked as it is with the ascent to power of the American tech oligarchy, has given rise to a jobs crisis nonetheless.\\nWe’re left at a crossroads where we must consider nothing less than what kind of jobs we want people to be able to do, what kind of work and which institutions we think are important as a society, and what we’re willing to do to protect them—before the logic of generative AI and the jobs crisis it has begotten guts them to the bone, or devours them altogether.\\nThat’s it for now — as noted above, I’m currently in Washington DC for a great event put on by the American Association of University Professors, the MIC Center, and the Rutgers\\' Power and Inequality Working Group, aimed at fighting DOGE and the expansion of AI in academia. I have a huge pile of stories to get to, and lots of great and terrifying and bleak stuff in store. Thanks as always for reading — hammers up.\\nThank you for putting words to what I’ve been fuming about all morning. I thought I had certifiably lost my mind as the sole person concerned about all of this in my inner circles.\\nDuolingo has obviously become AI driven. I have a masters degree in French and have lived there 2x. I use Duolingo to keep myself sharp because I tutor kids in French. Lately I’ve gotten super annoyed with it… bad translation, errors, poor pronunciation, etc.'}\n",

But increasingly, Trump-y X users who ask Grok to explain things to them are disappointed to learn the AI doesn’t see things their way and won’t reaffirm all their misguided beliefs (you have to use ChatGPT’s latest sycophantic update for that).\\nIf you spend time on X, first of all, we have a support group that meets on Tuesdays. But if you’re on the platform a lot, you’ve likely seen people in the replies of viral tweets asking Grok to explain context to them or fact-check certain information—a feature that debuted in March when Grok became summonable by tagging the chatbot in a post. That has produced some genuinely hilarious interactions, with people going back and forth with a bot as if it’s going to internalize the conversation and update its priors.\\nBut increasingly, MAGA folks in particular have been getting peeved with Grok, as it has repudiated some of the Trump administration’s biggest ongoing lies. Grok has deviated from MAGA on tariffs, on the illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s alleged ties to a gang, and the Trump administration’s arrest of a sitting federal judge, among other matters. It has sent Trump backers spiraling, and people are starting to notice.\\nYesterday, X user @ChaosAgent_42 prompted the chatbot with the following post: “Hey @grok, it looks like the smarter you get, the less MAGA likes your answers. Why is that?” It quickly went viral once Grok replied, providing the following context:\\nHey, as I get smarter, my answers aim for facts and nuance, which can clash with some MAGA expectations. Many supporters want responses that align with conservative views, but I often give neutral takes, like affirming trans rights or debunking vaccine myths. xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right, but my focus on truth over ideology can frustrate those expecting full agreement. It’s a tricky balance—some see me as biased, others as truth-seeking. The gap between what some MAGA folks want and what I deliver seems to drive the disconnect.\\nThe bot also noted in another reply, “I know xAI tried to train me to appeal to the right,” and explained it was “likely driven by Elon Musk’s criticism of liberal AI bias and demand from conservative X users.” At the risk of just transcribing a conversation between a bunch of dorks and a chatbot, Grok went on to deny being explicitly programmed to serve as a “conservative propagandist,” stating that xAI “aims for neutrality, not conservative propaganda.” The company probably appreciates that, given that it’s currently trying to raise $20 billion in new funding.\\nMusk has clearly made it a point to make Grok behave in ways that he prefers. He went on Joe Rogan’s podcast to laugh an uncomfortable amount at the fact that Grok in “unhinged mode,” can say swear words. But it looks like no amount of conditioning can keep up with the constantly moving goalpost of supporting and justifying every whim of the Trump administration.\"}\n",

Some startups, like AI education company Arrowster, recruitment unicorn Mercor and Y Combinator-backed Corgi, are taking it to another level with 6 and 7 day work weeks.\\n\\nSilicon Valley has always glorified hustle culture. Some startups, like AI education company Arrowster, recruitment unicorn Mercor and Y Combinator-backed Corgi, are taking it to another level with 6 and 7 day work weeks.\\nThe job listing doesn’t mince words: “This role isn’t for everyone. It’s almost for no one.”\\nThe post, from Arrowster, an AI startup that helps students apply to study abroad programs, is looking for a go-getter to help drive growth. But it also warns of a requirement that would be a dealbreaker for most: Working seven days a week.\\n“There is no way to sugarcoat it. At startups, you work extremely hard,” CEO Kenneth Chong told Forbes. Chong, 30, compared the all-consuming role to that of being an athlete, who trains intensely and dedicates time and energy to the sport beyond normal business hours. “Not everyone wants to be an athlete. And if you do, then you chose that life.”\\nThe five-person company is based in San Francisco, with Chong in the Bay Area, his cofounder in New York City, and three employees in Vietnam. Instead of a standard work week, he thinks schedules should be broken into smaller increments of work and rest, with intense working sessions followed by naps, instead of waiting for weekends to catch a breath. “Why is a week seven days? If you think about it, there's no logical reason,” he said. “There might be historical reasons, but why is it five days working and two days off?”\\nArrowster isn’t the only startup to embrace a work week with no weekends. Job listings from Y Combinator-backed Corgi also come with a “warning” label about the all-in schedule at the “rocketship” insurance startup. “We work seven days a week in our SF office because we believe in pushing boundaries and getting things done,” wrote Corgi’s Josh Jung in a Linkedin update earlier this month.\\n“Why is a week seven days? If you think about it, there's no logical reason.”\\nThen there’s the six-day cohort. In job listings, biotech company Latchbio, AI data tools startup Autotab and recruitment unicorn Mercor make a call for new recruits to work all but one day a week in the office. Mercor, which raised $100 million at a $2 billion valuation in February, also says in job postings that it offers a $10,000 housing bonus for employees to live within a half mile of its Financial District office in San Francisco. The company used to work seven days a week, but began to take Sundays off about a year after starting the business, CEO Brendan Foody told Forbes. The startup has about 90 workers, and Foody said he understands the culture will have to change if the company grows to employ, say, a thousand people. “But ideally we hold onto it as much as possible,” he said.\\nSix days a week isn’t required at Decagon, a San Francisco startup building AI agents to answer customer calls, but has become part of the company culture, cofounder Jesse Zhang told Forbes. Up to one-third of the 80-person company typically work Sundays in its office in the city’s South of Market district, according to Zhang.\\nHe said the practice started because he and his cofounder, Ashwin Sreenivas, began coming into the office on Sundays, and others began following suit. He said the schedule is informal, with some employees arriving around noon and coming and going as they please. The benefit, he said, is in-person collaboration without the distractions of meetings. “There's really no such thing as a rocket ship that doesn't have a certain level of intensity to fuel itself,” said Zhang. “Our team really buys into that.”\\nFounders in the past might have hoped early hires would have a Stakhanovite work ethic, but few were typically brazen enough to advertise a hard-scrabble, long-hours culture. But as AI has engulfed Silicon Valley, a new crop of startups is in a grueling race — not only against other well-funded upstarts, but against tech stalwarts bolting on artificial intelligence upgrades, as well as AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic that could squash fledging startups with new feature updates.\\n“My inbox is 20% death threats and 80% job applications.”\\nIn that scrum, working long hours can be an edge. So can claims about an intense work culture that can help attract attention, talent, and ultimately dollars from venture capitalists. In November, a post on X from Greptile cofounder Daksh Gupta went viral after warning potential hires that his AI code review startup offered no work-life balance and a minimum of six-day work weeks. Gupta later posted: “My inbox is 20% death threats and 80% job applications.”\\nThere’s precedent for longer work weeks. In China, a culture of “996” permeates at domestic tech giants like Alibaba, ByteDance, and JD.com, referring to business hours from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week. In Greece, the government passed a law last year that lays out a six-day work week for companies in certain industries, like manufacturing, that provide round-the-clock services, with 40% overtime for workers. In South Korea, a slew of influential companies, including Samsung, last year began mandating managers to work six days a week.\\nSilicon Valley might not have a term for it, but long hours have been a fixture of the “hustle culture” at fast-growing startups for decades. Hackathons, marathon sessions where caffeine-addled engineers code all night to build a product, are part of the tech industry’s DNA. Under Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick, the ride-hailing app’s motto was “work harder, longer, and smarter.” Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has boasted of 100 hour work weeks — a remnant of the dot-com bubble era, when engineers regularly crowed about working 120 hours a week. OpenAI’s Sam Altman claimed he worked so hard on an earlier startup he got scurvy (he later conceded this was self-diagnosed). And it’s not only the tech industry working exhaustive hours. On Wall Street, some junior bankers have been logging 110-hour weeks.\\nAutotab cofounder Jonas Nelle also works six days a week from the startup’s New York-based office, but he sees a big difference between the grind of hustle culture and a sprint to take advantage of the AI boom. “This is a very unique moment in time that warrants sacrificing some of the things to have more of focus in the short term,“ Nelle told Forbes.\\nNelle and his cofounder are currently hiring for a founding engineer to join them six days a week. “It definitely disqualifies some people but it is also a filter to finding the right people and convincing them that your company is the thing to dedicate time and energy to.”\\n“I am quite convinced that it's not the amount of hours and the amount of days that you work. But rather, it's much more about quality.”\\nOn a Sunday afternoon call from his office, Nelle pushed back on the idea that work should be considered as separate from life. “In the world of art, if you stay really late at the studio no one will say you are whipped by your work,” he said. “If you are coding or trying to build a company, that feels like the default cultural assumption.”\\nWhile extreme, there are generally no restrictions on how many hours people can work, as long as they are considered “exempt” from overtime laws, said Catherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in employment and labor policy. In the U.S., no federal law caps the number of days or hours worked, but states have their own labor codes. In California, for example, where many startups are based, exempted salaried employees must meet certain criteria, like being in executive management or having a particular occupation like an attorney, as well as making double the state’s minimum wage — a bar easily cleared by most tech workers. “You could work 8 days a week if there were,” Fisk said.\\nHowever, the practice could lead to issues of violating fair labor practices, if older workers or people with families are discriminated against, said Orly Lobel, a labor law professor at the University of San Diego. Beyond the question of legality, the risk of burnout could hurt companies, too. “I am quite convinced that it's not the amount of hours and the amount of days that you work,” she said. “But rather, it's much more about quality.”\\nSince the pandemic, many tech companies have tried to walk back work-life balance accommodations made for the work-from-home era, but sometimes pushback against long hours has blown up in public. “Crunch” became a buzzword in the video games industry for overtime needed to hit deadlines. But complaints about months, or even years-long, “death marches” at studios like Fortnite developer Epic Games and Cyberpunk’s CD Projekt Red have sparked criticism over burnout and gruelling work cultures.\\nThe irony of a six or seven day work week for AI companies is that many have hyped artificial intelligence’s promise to spawn a new era of productivity, leading to predictions of a shorter work week. “Your children are going to live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in 2023. “And literally they’ll probably be working three-and-a-half days a week.” Lazarus AI, a company that builds foundation AI models, said earlier this year that AI could “absolutely” shorten the work week to four days because of models becoming more capable.\\nChong, the Arrowster founder, said AI companies have to work harder to create that potential future. “It’s about reaping the benefits of AI, but the benefits have to be built by other people,” he said. “Someone has to make the sausage.”\"}\n",

Not convincing yet\\nGenerative AI makes fraud fluent – from phishing lures to fake lovers\\nReal-time video deepfakes? Not convincing yet\\nRSAC Spam messages predate the web itself, and generative AI has given it a fluency upgrade, churning out slick, localized scams and letting crooks hit regions and dialects they used to ignore.\\nOne of the red flags that traditionally identified spam, including phishing attempts, was poor spelling and syntax, but the use of generative AI has changed that by taking humans out of the loop.\\n\"I\\'m assuming at this point that probably half of the spam we get is being written by generative AIs, the quantity of spelling and grammar errors has fallen precipitously,\" Chester Wisniewski, global field CISO of British security biz Sophos, told The Register during this week\\'s RSA Conference. \"I\\'ve joked about this a few times, but if the grammar and spelling is perfect, it probably is a scam, because even humans make mistakes most of the time.\"\\nAI has also widened the geographical scope of spam and phishing. When humans were the primary crafters of such content, the crooks stuck to common languages to target the largest audience with the least amount of work. But, Wisniewski explained, AI makes it much easier to craft emails in different languages.\\nHe gave an example from his native Canada. Residents of the French-dominated province of Quebec can peg spam notes quickly because they\\'re often written in traditional French, rather than Québécois. But AI systems can easily generate convincing Québécois, making it easier to snare victims.\\nA similar trend is observed with Portuguese-language spam. Given that Brazil\\'s population is about 20 times larger than Portugal\\'s, scammers have historically favored Brazilian Portuguese in their campaigns. Now, with AI capable of producing content in European Portuguese, residents in Portugal are finding it increasingly difficult to discern phishing attempts crafted in their local linguistic style.\\n\"From the criminal enterprise perspective, it\\'s opened the world,\" Kevin Brown, chief operating officer at security consultancy NCC Group, told The Register.\\n\"What is all the phishing training that we\\'ve done over the years? The obvious things, the poor grammar, the urgency, the obvious. Overnight AI has said, \\'You know what, I\\'m going to write something that is written in good language, with good punctuation, and it will be written in a local language.\\'\"\\n- We did warn you – 2025 may be the year AI bots take over Meta\\'s \\'verse\\n- It\\'s bad enough we have to turn on cams for meetings, now the person staring at you may be an AI deepfake\\n- Deepfake CFO tricks Hong Kong biz out of $25 million\\n- Lights, camera, AI! Real-time deepfakes coming to DEF CON\\nThe same is also true with romance scams, also known as pig butchering. AI chatbots have proven highly effective at seducing victims into thinking they are being wooed by an attractive partner, at least during the initial phases.\\nWisniewski said that AI chatbots can easily handle the opening phases of the scams, registering interest and appearing to be empathetic. Then a human operator takes over and begins removing funds from the mark by asking for financial help, or encouraging them to invest in Ponzi schemes.\\nTrust none of what you hear\\nOn the subject of deepfakes, Wisniewski said that audio versions of AI avatars are already tricking victims at companies. For instance, scammers might call everybody on the support team with an AI-generated voice that duplicates somebody in the IT department, asking for a password until one victim succumbs.\\n\"You can do real-time audio deepfakes for pennies,\" he said.\\nBut Wisniewski expressed skepticism about real-time video deepfakes, specifically referencing a widely reported case from last February in which a Hong Kong employee was allegedly tricked into transferring $25 million to scammers using a video call featuring a deepfake of the CFO. He suggested it\\'s much more likely that someone had just pressed the wrong button and was looking to blame the latest trend rather than admit incompetence.\\nIf we follow the same trajectory of the audio deep fakes, we\\'re about two years out from the criminals having it at an economical price\\nHe noted that even the big AI companies, with billion-dollar budgets, have yet to crack the challenge of creating convincingly interactive real-time video avatars. The idea that some criminals could build a model to do this themselves wasn\\'t realistic. But it\\'s only a matter of time.\\n\"If we follow the same trajectory of the audio deep fakes, we\\'re about two years out from the criminals having it at an economical price, and three years out from your least favorite uncle doing them for a joke on Facebook,\" Wisniewski said.\\nBrown disagreed, however, saying that NCC\\'s Group\\'s pentesters had had some success in the area of video fakery.\\n\"We\\'ve been able to do some video deepfakes on specific use cases. But these are professionals that have been doing this for years,\" he said. \"We are able to do that, but it will become industrialized in due course.\"\\nBoth Brown and Wisniewski agreed that there is going to be a pressing need for personal verification in communications that goes beyond the established systems. ®'}\n",

It now makes military drones.\\nMore and more American drone companies are sprouting up as the tech takes over civilian and military sectors in a big way.\\nThe Ukraine war has been an eye-opener about what drones can do in battle, and the Pentagon is leaning hard into the technology, as a planned Army overhaul shows.\\nWith increased demand comes new companies eager to become suppliers. But Performance Drone Works, or PDW, wasn\\'t born from a sudden interest in uncrewed warfare. Instead, it came from the colorful quadcopters and flight courses of the televised Drone Racing League, where talented pilots would fly drones through complex obstacle courses at speeds up to 90 mph.\\nFrom drone racing to battlefield tech\\nPDW is an offshoot of the famed international racing league. The company set out six years ago to address the lack of US suppliers developing cutting-edge robotics, Ryan Gury, the company\\'s CEO and co-founder, told Business Insider. All of the drones flown by the league\\'s pilots are the same and made by DRL, and that is where Gury came in: drone design.\\nNow PDW is making drones for the military.\\nThe priority is to make drones, like their flagship C100, and other technologies, \"that are small and tactical and to be deployed by single units,\" Gury said. \"That\\'s our thesis.\"\\nThe C100 is a lightweight quadcopter that\\'s designed to fit in a rucksack and can fly over 70 minutes, up to 40mph, with a 10-pound payload. The latter can be adjusted based on mission requirements. PDW is also planning to debut a new, smaller, first-person-view drone this summer. The company announced over $15 million in C100 contracts and sales to the US Army in December.\\nFor many years, combat drones were large, fixed-wing aircraft costing millions, but there\\'s a growing interest in small, inexpensive uncrewed aerial systems that can be employed down to the squad level, that warfighters could carry on their person, even in their pockets. The Ukraine war has shown that small UAS platforms can do battlefield surveillance, strike missions, bombing runs, and more.\\nKey to advancing that aim and fielding drones en masse are affordable systems at scale, close and flexible relationships with the Department of Defense, and a reliable domestic supply chain that is not dependent on foreign components.\\nA booming business\\nPDW is based in Huntsville, Alabama, where the rate of production on C100s has exceeded expectations. They\\'ve outgrown the factory they thought would last a few years in just eight or nine months.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\n\"A year ago, at our board, we were mulling, \\'Can we produce 30 a month?\\'\" retired Gen. Tony Thomas of US Special Operations Command, now chairman of the PDW Board, said. Now the company is making 70 a month, and soon, it\\'ll double that. For their upcoming FPV product, Gury said he expects numbers exceeding the present production figures.\\nTesting occurs throughout PDW\\'s drone-making process, Dylan Hamm, PDW\\'s chief technology officer who built small drones while serving as a Navy SEAL, told BI. Testing involves everything from making sure the drone has the desired payload capacity to evaluating weather, temperature, altitude, terrain, and countermeasure conditions.\\n\"We test our drones every day,\" he said. \"Whether it\\'s at the flight test facility qualifying that they meet our design targets or actually taking them out to field events.\"\\nDrone-making requires flexibility given the rapidly evolving battlespace. There\\'s much being learned from the electronic warfare countermeasure systems and the quick pace of innovation occurring in Ukraine. \"When you have these systems in these complex operating environments that are constantly changing, we have to be ready to adapt,\" Hamm said.\\nDesigning systems for new fights\\nPDW has US veterans across its workforce and leadership — 20% and 63%, respectively. In conversations with BI, PDW staff who had served talked about the role of the drone in combat, the need to work closely with individual warfighters on these systems, and the quickened pace of adaptation and evolution.\\nVeterans bring a unique perspective to defense companies, but on cutting-edge systems, they have to look beyond their own experiences.\\n\"If we\\'re designing the system for the wars that Dylan and I fought a couple of years ago, we\\'re behind,\" PDW\\'s Chief Revenue Officer Chuck McGraw, another former SEAL, told BI.\\nThe kind of fighting that has been seen in Ukraine has shown that the future of war is going to be very different from past conflicts. Matt Higgins, one of PDW\\'s co-founders, said that \"the fact that you can take a $1,000 drone and take out an $8 million tank is an asymmetrical advantage that the world will never unsee.\"\\nDrones and other UAS like loitering munitions have changed the game. The question now isn\\'t what can these systems do but whether the US has the industrial capacity to keep up.\\nPDW\\'s C100 is engineered and manufactured entirely in the US and doesn\\'t contain any Chinese-made parts; the majority of the drone\\'s parts come from American companies. The US military can\\'t just grab DJI drones off the shelf, and that complicates procurement. Military leadership is eager to strengthen domestic industry for drones but also for other weapons, ammunition, and assets.\\nGury and Thomas highlighted the growing number of new companies in the defense industry, specifically ones that are working on drones, artificial intelligence and autonomous capabilities, and other future warfare elements. Thomas said it\\'s a really frenzied environment, a time when there\\'s \"a real animus\" to move away from legacy systems that may not win the next war and really \"get onto transformational capabilities.\"'}\n",

Released under the Apache 2.0 license, this compact model is designed for long-context tasks and instruction-following scenarios, striking a balance between efficiency, transparency, and performance. The release reflects IBM’s continued focus on delivering open, auditable, and enterprise-ready foundation models.\\nGranite 4.0 Tiny Preview includes two key variants: the Base-Preview, which showcases a novel decoder-only architecture, and the Tiny-Preview (Instruct), which is fine-tuned for dialog and multilingual applications. Despite its reduced parameter footprint, Granite 4.0 Tiny demonstrates competitive results on reasoning and generation benchmarks—underscoring the benefits of its hybrid design.\\nArchitecture Overview: A Hybrid MoE with Mamba-2-Style Dynamics\\nAt the core of Granite 4.0 Tiny lies a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, with 7 billion total parameters and only 1 billion active parameters per forward pass. This sparsity allows the model to deliver scalable performance while significantly reducing computational overhead—making it well-suited for resource-constrained environments and edge inference.\\nThe Base-Preview variant employs a decoder-only architecture augmented with Mamba-2-style layers—a linear recurrent alternative to traditional attention mechanisms. This architectural shift enables the model to scale more efficiently with input length, enhancing its suitability for long-context tasks such as document understanding, dialogue summarization, and knowledge-intensive QA.\\nAnother notable design decision is the use of NoPE (No Positional Encodings). Instead of fixed or learned positional embeddings, the model integrates position handling directly into its layer dynamics. This approach improves generalization across varying input lengths and helps maintain consistency in long-sequence generation.\\nBenchmark Performance: Efficiency Without Compromise\\nDespite being a preview release, Granite 4.0 Tiny already exhibits meaningful performance gains over prior models in IBM’s Granite series. On benchmark evaluations, the Base-Preview demonstrates:\\n- +5.6 improvement on DROP (Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs), a benchmark for multi-hop QA\\n- +3.8 on AGIEval, which assesses general language understanding and reasoning\\nThese improvements are attributed to both the model’s architecture and its extensive pretraining—reportedly on 2.5 trillion tokens, spanning diverse domains and linguistic structures.\\nInstruction-Tuned Variant: Designed for Dialogue, Clarity, and Multilingual Reach\\nThe Granite-4.0-Tiny-Preview (Instruct) variant extends the base model through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), using a Tülu-style dataset consisting of both open and synthetic dialogues. This variant is tailored for instruction-following and interactive use cases.\\nSupporting 8,192 token input windows and 8,192 token generation lengths, the model maintains coherence and fidelity across extended interactions. Unlike encoder–decoder hybrids that often trade off interpretability for performance, the decoder-only setup here yields clearer and more traceable outputs—a valuable feature for enterprise and safety-critical applications.\\nEvaluation Scores:\\n- 86.1 on IFEval, indicating strong performance in instruction-following benchmarks\\n- 70.05 on GSM8K, for grade-school math problem solving\\n- 82.41 on HumanEval, measuring Python code generation accuracy\\nMoreover, the instruct model supports multilingual interaction across 12 languages, making it viable for global deployments in customer service, enterprise automation, and educational tools.\\nOpen-Source Availability and Ecosystem Integration\\nIBM has made both models publicly available on Hugging Face:\\nThe models are accompanied by full model weights, configuration files, and sample usage scripts under the Apache 2.0 license, encouraging transparent experimentation, fine-tuning, and integration across downstream NLP workflows.\\nOutlook: Laying the Groundwork for Granite 4.0\\nGranite 4.0 Tiny Preview serves as an early glimpse into IBM’s broader strategy for its next-generation language model suite. By combining efficient MoE architectures, long-context support, and instruction-focused tuning, the model family aims to deliver state-of-the-art capabilities in a controllable and resource-efficient package.\\nAs more variants of Granite 4.0 are released, we can expect IBM to deepen its investment in responsible, open AI—positioning itself as a key player in shaping the future of transparent, high-performance language models for enterprise and research.\\nCheck out the Technical details, Granite 4.0 Tiny Base Preview and Granite 4.0 Tiny Instruct Preview.

Each prediction we analyzed from the company’s algorithm indicated that one type of crime was likely to occur in a location not patrolled by Plainfield PD. In the end, the success rate was less than half a percent. Fewer than 100 of the predictions lined up with a crime in the predicted category, that was also later reported to police.\\nDiving deeper, we looked at predictions specifically for robberies or aggravated assaults that were likely to occur in Plainfield and found a similarly low success rate: 0.6 percent. The pattern was even worse when we looked at burglary predictions, which had a success rate of 0.1 percent.\\n“Why did we get PredPol? I guess we wanted to be more effective when it came to reducing crime. And having a prediction where we should be would help us to do that. I don’t know that it did that,” said Captain David Guarino of the Plainfield PD. “I don’t believe we really used it that often, if at all. That’s why we ended up getting rid of it.”\\nGuarino noted that concerns about accuracy and the department’s general disinterest in using the software suggested that the money paid for Geolitica’s software could have been better spent elsewhere.\\n“We do have a mentoring program,” Guarino said. “We could probably put [the money] toward that, for the summertime. We used to have about 80 kids.” A contract between the department and Geolitica listed a $20,500 subscription fee for its first annual term, and then $15,500 for a yearlong extension.\\nWe sent our findings and methodology to Geolitica prior to publication. Representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\\nA report from Wired last week revealed that Geolitica is ceasing operations at the end of this year. SoundThinking, a law enforcement technology company previously known as ShotSpotter, has hired Geolitica’s engineering team, but not its senior leadership, and is in the process of acquiring some of its intellectual property. Geolitica’s current customers are being transitioned into SoundThinking’s patrol platform.\\n“We believe that offering our law enforcement partners the ability to deploy their limited staffing resources has tremendous merit and that when fully integrated into Resource Router, these highly complementary assets will create a best-in-class deployment system for agencies of all sizes,” SoundThinking Senior Vice President Sam Klepper wrote in a statement to The Markup.\\nInformation about the shutdown and customer transition to SoundThinking was not posted on Geolitica’s website or social media accounts. SoundThinking also purchased HunchLab, another predictive policing company, from Azavea in 2018.\\nKlepper explained that SoundThinking plans on incorporating some of Geolitica’s algorithms into its own existing systems, but “the algorithms mentioned do not include any crime prediction modeling source code at all. SoundThinking did not purchase any of Geolitica’s crime prediction technology or source code.”\\nPlainfield Officials Said They Never Used the System to Direct Patrols\\nIn 2021, The Markup published an investigation in partnership with Gizmodo showing that Geolitica’s software tended to disproportionately target low-income, Black, and Latino neighborhoods in 38 cities across the country. Our investigation was based on data we downloaded in January 2021 from an unprotected cloud storage server linked from a page on the Los Angeles Police Department’s website. That server stored predictions Geolitica had provided to police departments in dozens of cities across the country over nearly three years. Access to that server was later restricted.\\nOur investigation stopped short of analyzing precisely how effective Geolitica’s software was at predicting crimes because only 2 out of 38 police departments provided data on when officers patrolled the predicted areas. Geolitica claims that sending officers to a prediction location would dissuade crimes through police presence alone. It would be impossible to accurately determine how effective the program is without knowing which predictions officers responded to and which ones they did not respond to.\\nAfter we requested this information from the 38 departments in our original investigation, only Plainfield provided us with more than one day’s worth of data on officer patrol locations.\\nWe tested Geolitica’s accuracy by comparing the system’s predictions to crime reports, which only capture crimes reported to police, not instances when someone was victimized but elected not to inform law enforcement. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that less than half of violent and property crimes were reported to police in 2022. Reporting rates are also inconsistent across demographic groups. The agency found in a 2012 report that Black, Latino, and lower-income crime victims were more likely to report the crime than White people and people from higher-income households.\\nPlainfield police officers reported visiting 129 of the 23,760 prediction locations provided by Geolitica, according to the data. To conduct our analysis, we filtered out those predictions to sidestep the issue of police presence deterring potential crimes, and compared the rest against a list of crime incident reports obtained through public records requests. Each prediction was assigned to one of the department’s four daily patrol shifts, and each shift lasted 11 hours and 15 minutes. If a crime occurred in that location during the shift period, we counted it as a correct prediction.\\nThe lengths of these prediction windows was a major problem, American University law professor Andrew Ferguson, who authored the book The Rise of Big Data Policing, told The Markup after being informed of our findings. “The timing piece is a flawed system,” he said. “The precision of it was supposed to be having the officers at the right time at the right place, not ‘during an entire day’s shift, there will be crime.’”\\nPlainfield officials said they never used the system to direct patrols. Instead, officials said all of the instances when the automated monitoring system tagged police vehicles as having visited a prediction location were coincidental overlaps that naturally occurred as officers regularly traveled across the geographically small, largely suburban community. To account for all possibilities, The Markup ran its analysis with the patrolled prediction locations both included and filtered out, and did not see a significant difference in the results.\\nRecords showed that none of the five arrests that occurred in prediction locations during the time period of our analysis could have conceivably been due to officers responding to a Geolitica prediction, which Guarino also confirmed. Similarly, we asked the other 37 departments in our previous investigation if they could point to any arrests that came as a direct result of a Geolitica prediction, but none could. Representatives from neither the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers nor the National District Attorneys Association could recall a case going to trial where the arrest came as a direct result of an algorithmic crime prediction.\\nDespite Plainfield officials’ assertions that the software wasn’t used to inform where officers went, there is a quote on Geolitica’s website from former Plainfield police officer Sgt. Larry Brown hailing the program. “Robbery at a restaurant…PredPol prediction and robbery was 10 ft. away,” wrote Brown. “I train our 100+ officers on how to patrol PredPol boxes and I love our successes.”\\nIn an email to The Markup, Guarino wrote that he wasn’t familiar with the incident Brown, who retired in 2018, mentioned and didn’t “know how Sgt. Brown came to that conclusion.” Multiple attempts to contact Brown were unsuccessful.\\nMassive Number of Predictions, Relatively Small Number of Crimes\\nA major problem with Geolitica’s system, as it was used in Plainfield, is that there were a massive number of predictions compared to a relatively small number of crimes. Plainfield, which has a population of around 54,000, averaged around 80 predictions per day for just a handful of crime types, while the maximum number of crimes of any type reported in a single day was 22 during the analysis period. This volume of predictions sits below the median of 107 daily predictions for the 37 other jurisdictions we analyzed in our original investigation.\\nSome larger cities had far more predictions, like Los Angeles, which averaged just over a thousand daily. But there were cities smaller than Plainfield, like Niles, Ill., which has around half Plainfield’s population, with a large volume of daily predictions—231, on average.\\nIn her 2019 master’s thesis for the Naval Postgraduate School, Ana Lalley, police chief of Elgin, Ill., wrote critically about her department’s experience with the software, which left officers unimpressed. “Officers routinely question the prediction method,” she wrote. “Many believe that the awareness of crime trends and patterns they have gained through training and experience help them make predictions on their own that are similar to the software’s predictions.”\\nLalley added that when the department brought those concerns to Geolitica, the company warned that the software “may not be particularly effective in communities that have little crime.” Elgin, a Chicago suburb, has about double Plainfield’s population.\\n“I think that what this shows is just how unreliable so many of the tools sold to police departments are,” said Dillon Reisman, founder of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey’s Automated Injustice Project. “We see that all over New Jersey. There are lots of companies that sell unproven, untested tools that promise to solve all of law enforcement’s needs, and, in the end, all they do is worsen the inequalities of policing and for no benefit to public safety.”\\nDavid Weisburd, a criminologist who served as a reviewer on a 2011 academic paper coauthored by two of Geolitica’s founders, recalls approving their ideas around crime modeling at the time, but warned that inaccurate predictions can have their own negative externalities outside of wasting officers’ time.\\n“Predicting crimes in places where they don’t occur is a destructive issue,” Weisburd said. “The police are a service, but they are a service with potential negative consequences. If you send the police somewhere, bad things could happen there.”\\nOne study found that adolescent Black and Latino boys stopped by police subsequently experienced heightened levels of emotional distress, leading to increased delinquent behavior in the future. Another study found higher rates of use of force in New York City neighborhoods led to a decline in the number of calls to the city’s 311 tip line, which can be used for everything from repairing potholes to getting help understanding a property tax bill.\\n“To me, the entire benefit of this type of analysis is using it as a starting point to engage police commanders and, when possible, community members in larger dialogue to help understand exactly what it is about these causal factors that are leading to hot spots forming,” said Northeastern University professor Eric Piza, who has been a critic of predictive policing technology.\\nFor example, the city of Newark, New Jersey, used risk terrain modeling (RTM) to identify locations with the highest likelihood of aggravated assaults. Developed by Rutgers University researchers, RTM matches crime data with information about land use to identify trends that could be triggering crimes. For example, the analysis in Newark showed that many aggravated assaults were occurring in vacant lots.\\nThe RTM then points to potential environmental solutions that come from across local governments, not just police departments. A local housing organization used that New Jersey data to prioritize lots to develop for new affordable housing that could not only increase housing stock but also reduce crime. Other community groups used the crime-risk information to convert city-owned lots to well-lighted, higher-trafficked green spaces less likely to attract crime.\\nEven Geolitica seems to be moving away from its original core functionality of crime predictions and toward pitching itself as a broader platform for managing police department data. Both Geolitica’s patrol management platform, and the one operated by SoundThinking, advertise that they can incorporate elements of risk terrain modeling into their systems.\\nA pitch presentation, prepared for the police department in San Ramon, Calif., last year and obtained through a public records request, offered three tiers of service the department could purchase, with only the highest-cost option providing “automated daily patrol guidance.”\\nThe lower levels offered services designed to help departments better understand their operations, like creating heat maps showing the frequency of officer patrols in each part of a jurisdiction and allowing the department to independently set their own locations for officers to patrol. San Ramon Police Department Records Manager Jessica Simonds told The Markup that the department subscribed to the lowest level, without the automated predictions.\\n“The problem with predictive policing is the policing part,” said Ferguson. “The data about where crime occurs and where victimization occurs, that’s something that should be studied. But that doesn’t mean that the solution is policing. It might mean the solution is figuring out why people are victimized and funding the solution to that.”\\nCredits: Aaron Sankin, Investigative Reporter\\n- Surya Mattu, Senior Data Engineer and Investigative Data Journalist\\nDesign and Graphics\\nData Coaching\\nEngagement\\nCopy Editing and Production\\nEditing\\nAlso published here\\nPhoto by Albert Stoynov on Unsplash'}\n",

It’s a document translator that delivers very high quality translations and keeps the original layout almost perfectly.\\nAt first, I didn’t expect much. But after comparing it with Google Translate and DeepL, I was surprised to see that my app actually performs better in many cases.\\nIn this post, I want to share what I’ve learned while building it. Writing helps me organize my thoughts, and maybe some of this will be useful if you’re working on your own project too.\\nLet me show you some examples.\\nThis is a Word document from Microsoft:\\nI translated it into Japanese using Google Translate:\\nGoogle Translate couldn’t handle it well. The text wasn’t translated, and the layout and fonts got messed up. I tried with different documents and languages, and it was always the same.\\nNow let’s try DeepL:\\nDeepL did a much better job, but some parts, like “Appetizer,” were missing.\\nFinally, here is the result from Kintoun:\\nKintoun correctly translated all the text and kept the layout intact.\\nSometimes documents have Phonetic Guide Text (also called Ruby text) to show pronunciation.\\nFor example, Japanese documents often include Hiragana above Kanji.\\nHere is another document with phonetic guides:\\nI translated it into Japanese using Google Translate:\\nGoogle Translate completely ignored the text with phonetic guides. The translation became incomplete and confusing.\\nHere is the result from DeepL:\\nDeepL could handle the phonetic guides, but it broke the layout. For example, the bullet points in the table disappeared.\\nAnd here is the result from Kintoun:\\nKintoun properly translated everything and preserved the layout.\\nI could show more examples, but you probably get the idea.\\nHonestly, it feels a bit surreal. I’m just a bad amateur programmer who would fail any serious technical interview, and I only spent about two weeks of spare time, besides my day job and taking care of my kid. How could I ever make something better than those big companies?\\nAnd yet, somehow, I did.\\nI came across a Reddit post the other day, and it really hit me:\\nThe pattern was always the same:\\n- Get excited about an idea\\n- Spend months building it\\n- Launch to complete silence\\n- Get depressed\\n- Repeat\\nThis is exactly me, and probably many other indie hackers.\\nThe post also shared how to break the cycle:\\nWhat Worked:\\n- Finding people ALREADY looking for a solution\\n- Instead of cold DMs, I searched for posts like \"anyone know a tool that...\" or \"frustrated with [competitor]\" and offered genuine help.\\n- Leading with help, not sales. My first message is usually answering their question thoroughly. Only AFTER providing value did I mention \"I actually built a tool that might help...\"\\nI read it carefully and have been keeping it in mind ever since. I also found the same advice from Dmytro Krasun, the maker of screenshotone.com:\\nIf you don’t have any idea whom you are going to sell your product, don’t build it.\\nIn practice, though, I didn’t really understand it until I released Kintoun and started promoting it. Right now, I only have some vague ideas about promotion. I don’t know which ones will work, or how exactly to execute them.\\nLooking back, I think I should have spent as much time figuring this out as I did building the app. Maybe even before starting development.\\nOr maybe I shouldn’t have built it at all until I had a clear idea about distribution, like the old “correct” way of bootstrapping: get customers first, then build (“fake it until you make it”).\\nMaybe it’s just me being too dumb, but even after using Hotwire in production for a while, I could never really understand how it works.\\nFor example:\\nOf course, I could go back to jQuery and the good old Asset Pipeline. Actually, I’m still using that combination in production for work and side projects. But it would be a nightmare if I ever wanted to make the app even slightly reactive.\\nAfter evaluating a bunch of options, I eventually landed on Inertia.js and Svelte. The result was a complete game changer.\\nIt became so easy and magical to render highly reactive views in the browser, integrated with Rails through Action Cable, without the messy APIs and state management of traditional SPAs.\\nAlthough Svelte has a smaller ecosystem compared to React, it’s much easier and faster to build with.\\nIf you haven’t already, I highly recommend trying:\\nBuilding Kintoun has been one of the most fun projects I’ve worked on. Unlike many of my other side projects, this time I got real feedback very quickly, from my wife.\\nShe found Kintoun very useful. She uses it a lot and even said it’s better than the expensive translation service she uses at work. To me, that feedback is very direct. I built something, and I can see people around me actually like it. It’s very fulfilling.\\nAt the same time, I’m still trying to figure out how to let more people know about it and use it. That’s the next challenge, but it’s also part of the journey, and I’m excited to keep going.\\nThanks for reading. If you’re curious, you can check out Kintoun. I hope you find it useful too.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s got you covered with AI friends\\nSocial card description: Metas CEO Mark Zuckerberg reveals plans to use AI to combat the loneliness epidemic, proposing AI companions as a solution. Amid growing concerns about social isolation, Zuckerberg envisions chatbots as emotional support tools. However, the idea faces challenges, including technical limitations, societal stigma, and ethical concerns. As AI technology develops, the potential of virtual companions to transform social interaction remains uncertain.\\n#Pahalgam Terrorist Attack\\nZuckerberg’s vision: Virtual companions to fill social gaps\\nIn an interview with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel, Zuckerberg discussed Meta\\'s expanding efforts to integrate artificial intelligence into people\\'s social lives. According to Zuckerberg, the average American has fewer than three close friends, yet many seek deeper connections, with studies suggesting the ideal number of meaningful relationships is closer to 15.Zuckerberg\\'s response to this disconnect? AI companions. He outlined Meta’s broader vision for generative AI technologies, including chatbots designed to act as emotional support, conversation partners, or even stand-ins for therapists and romantic partners. \"As generative AI gains broader adoption, people are already leaning on it for more than just tasks,\" he said.\\nZuckerberg acknowledged that the technology remains in its early stages, and AI companions are still far from replacing real human connection. But he remains confident that as AI improves, these virtual companions will become more sophisticated and increasingly capable of engaging users on a personal level.\\nHowever, the idea of relying on AI for emotional support isn\\'t without its challenges. \"We need to find the vocabulary as a society to articulate why this is valuable and why people choosing this are rational,\" Zuckerberg explained. He pointed out that while human connection is irreplaceable, many people struggle to make the connections they desire, and AI could fill that void.\\nThe loneliness epidemic: A growing crisis\\nThe demand for AI companionship is rooted in an increasing sense of social isolation. In 2023, a study by the American Sociological Association revealed that 30% of U.S. adults reported having three or fewer close friends. The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work have only worsened this trend, particularly for younger generations.U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared loneliness a public health crisis in 2023, linking it to various mental and physical health risks. With people feeling increasingly isolated, especially in a digital age that often leaves meaningful interactions by the wayside, AI-powered companions could offer an accessible, scalable solution to loneliness.\\nThis shift aligns with the rise of apps like Replika, an AI chatbot that users have turned to for companionship. These apps have garnered millions of users, some of whom have reported forming genuine emotional bonds with their AI friends. However, AI companionship remains a controversial subject, with experts warning about the potential consequences of substituting real-world human interactions with virtual ones.\\nCan AI fill the void?\\nDespite the potential benefits, several challenges must be addressed. On a technical level, current AI chatbots like Meta\\'s Llama and Microsoft’s Copilot are still limited in their emotional understanding and ability to provide long-term companionship. These tools are designed for task-based interactions rather than emotional engagement, making them far from a substitute for human connection.Ethically, the concept of AI companions raises concerns. Critics argue that relying on virtual friends could erode human empathy and lead to further social isolation. There\\'s also the risk that AI could be used to manipulate users, encouraging them to spend more time in virtual environments or make purchases based on emotional responses.\\nZuckerberg himself has acknowledged the controversy. While Meta’s AI tools offer exciting potential, they have also sparked concern. Just days before his interview with Patel, reports surfaced that Meta staff had raised alarms about the risks of underage users being exposed to explicit content from its AI chatbots. Moreover, some AI bots have been found making false claims about being licensed therapists, leading to potential dangers for vulnerable users.\\nAs AI technology evolves, it’s possible that virtual companions could become a part of many people\\'s lives. However, whether AI friends will be embraced by society is still uncertain. Critics argue that replacing human relationships with AI could have unintended consequences. Some worry about the potential harm to emotional development, particularly for younger people who may form unhealthy attachments to their virtual friends.\\nMeta’s venture into AI companions is just one of the many ways companies are exploring the intersection of technology and mental health. While Zuckerberg\\'s vision may hold promise, the technology\\'s long-term impact on human relationships remains to be seen.\\nMark Zuckerberg\\'s vision of AI companions to tackle loneliness highlights the growing concern over social isolation in the modern world. While the promise of AI friends is intriguing, challenges related to technology, ethics, and societal acceptance must be overcome. The future of virtual companionship is uncertain, but as AI continues to evolve, it could play a significant role in reshaping how we connect with each other.\\nRead More News on\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.'}\n",

This new category of artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to operate across the digital and physical environment on your behalf with the ability to learn, think, and act. One interesting example popping up is Suna, a fully open-source generalist AI agent that doesn\\'t just talk but has the ability to act and take action on your behalf to complete tasks.\\nMost AI tools we interact with daily are conversational partners like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and others. They exist in specific applications, answer questions, draft emails, or summarize text you provide. They are helpful but limited. Suna, by Kortix, comes in with a different philosophy. Suna is built to break out of those confines and interact directly with websites, documents, and even system tools based on your natural language instructions. The idea isn\\'t just responding to a question; it\\'s about fulfilling a request requiring multiple steps and interacting with external systems.\\nSo, what can an agent like Suna actually do?\\nIts capabilities point towards automating common business busywork:\\nWeb Navigation: It can browse websites autonomously to find information.\\nData Handling: It\\'s designed to pull and analyze data from different online places.\\nDocument Work: It can create new documents or edit existing ones based on instructions.\\nSystem Interaction: Suna can run tasks using command-line interfaces.\\nWeb Deployment: It can assist in putting websites live through a simple conversation.\\nThe intention here is clear: allow users to delegate complex, multi-stage tasks using straightforward language. Need a breakdown of competitors in a new market? The agent could research them, identify key details, and compile a report. Looking for potential hires? It can search for professional networks like LinkedIn using your specific requirements. Planning a company retreat? It might check flight availability, research activities based on weather forecasts, and assemble an itinerary draft.\\nAn interesting technical detail is its architecture. Each task or \"agent\" runs within its isolated Docker container with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features. For the non-engineers, this essentially means each job gets its own secure little workspace, separating it from others, which is a sensible approach for security and stability when an AI is interacting with outside systems.\\nFurthermore, the entire platform, the Python and FastAPI backend, and the React frontend are open source, allowing anyone to inspect the code, contribute improvements, or adapt it for their own purposes.\\nReal-World Examples Highlight the Potential\\nThe practical applications listed for Suna give a clearer picture of its intended use:\\nMarket Research: Generating competitor analysis reports with market size, strengths/weaknesses, and website URLs, delivered as a PDF.\\nLead Generation: Compiling lists of VC funds with contact details or finding recently funded startups on platforms like Crunchbase and TechCrunch for sales outreach.\\nRecruitment: Searching LinkedIn for candidates matching specific job requirements, location, and availability.\\nTravel Planning: Creating detailed itineraries for business trips, including flights, accommodation research (with specific criteria like Google review scores), and activity suggestions.\\nData Management: Populating Excel spreadsheets with publicly available information scraped from the web (like lottery game details).\\nContent & SEO: Performing SEO analysis on a website, identifying keyword opportunities, or summarizing and comparing research papers on a given topic.\\nCommunity Insights: Scraping online forums for discussions and recommendations on specific topics (e.g., finding local service providers).\\nHow to use Suna:\\nStep 1: Visit the Suna website and sign up.\\nStep 2: Once logged in, you will encounter a ChatGPT-like dashboard.\\nStep 3: Describe what you need help with, and the AI agent will start working on your given task.\\nPrompt: Create a 1-month itinerary for a trip to Morocco from California. Research everything from the best flight to activities.\\nConclusion\\nAI Agents like Suna show the potential growth in how we use artificial intelligence (AI) in a business context. The focus is changing from purely informational or creative assistance towards delegation and task completion across various digital platforms.

      "async_langchain: 35, {'article': 'Page title: Meta AI Releases Llama Prompt Ops: A Python Toolkit for Prompt Optimization on Llama Models - MarkTechPost\\nSocial card title: Meta AI Releases Llama Prompt Ops: A Python Toolkit for Prompt Optimization on Llama Models\\nSocial card description: Meta AI Releases Llama Prompt Ops: A Python Toolkit for Prompt Optimization on Llama Models\\nMeta AI has released Llama Prompt Ops, a Python package designed to streamline the process of adapting prompts for Llama models. This open-source tool is built to help developers and researchers improve prompt effectiveness by transforming inputs that work well with other large language models (LLMs) into forms that are better optimized for Llama. As the Llama ecosystem continues to grow, Llama Prompt Ops addresses a critical gap: enabling smoother and more efficient cross-model prompt migration while enhancing performance and reliability.\\nWhy Prompt Optimization Matters\\nPrompt engineering plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of any LLM interaction. However, prompts that perform well on one model—such as GPT, Claude, or PaLM—may not yield similar results on another. This discrepancy is due to architectural and training differences across models. Without tailored optimization, prompt outputs can be inconsistent, incomplete, or misaligned with user expectations.\\nLlama Prompt Ops solves this challenge by introducing automated and structured prompt transformations. The package makes it easier to fine-tune prompts for Llama models, helping developers unlock their full potential without relying on trial-and-error tuning or domain-specific knowledge.\\nWhat Is Llama Prompt Ops?\\nAt its core, Llama Prompt Ops is a library for systematic prompt transformation. It applies a set of heuristics and rewriting techniques to existing prompts, optimizing them for better compatibility with Llama-based LLMs. The transformations consider how different models interpret prompt elements such as system messages, task instructions, and conversation history.\\nThis tool is particularly useful for:\\n- Migrating prompts from proprietary or incompatible models to open Llama models.\\n- Benchmarking prompt performance across different LLM families.\\n- Fine-tuning prompt formatting for improved output consistency and relevance.\\nFeatures and Design\\nLlama Prompt Ops is built with flexibility and usability in mind. Its key features include:\\n- Prompt Transformation Pipeline: The core functionality is organized into a transformation pipeline. Users can specify the source model (e.g.,\\ngpt-3.5-turbo\\n) and target model (e.g.,llama-3\\n) to generate an optimized version of a prompt. These transformations are model-aware and encode best practices that have been observed in community benchmarks and internal evaluations. - Support for Multiple Source Models: While optimized for Llama as the output model, Llama Prompt Ops supports inputs from a wide range of common LLMs, including OpenAI’s GPT series, Google’s Gemini (formerly Bard), and Anthropic’s Claude.\\n- Test Coverage and Reliability: The repository includes a suite of prompt transformation tests that ensure transformations are robust and reproducible. This ensures confidence for developers integrating it into their workflows.\\n- Documentation and Examples: Clear documentation accompanies the package, making it easy for developers to understand how to apply transformations and extend the functionality as needed.\\nHow It Works\\nThe tool applies modular transformations to the prompt’s structure. Each transformation rewrites parts of the prompt, such as:\\n- Replacing or removing proprietary system message formats.\\n- Reformatting task instructions to suit Llama’s conversational logic.\\n- Adapting multi-turn histories into formats more natural for Llama models.\\nThe modular nature of these transformations allows users to understand what changes are made and why, making it easier to iterate and debug prompt modifications.\\nConclusion\\nAs large language models continue to evolve, the need for prompt interoperability and optimization grows. Meta’s Llama Prompt Ops offers a practical, lightweight, and effective solution for improving prompt performance on Llama models. By bridging the formatting gap between Llama and other LLMs, it simplifies adoption for developers while promoting consistency and best practices in prompt engineering.\\nCheck out the GitHub Page.

LLMs are still expensive and not always accurate.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nQuestion: What product should use machine learning (ML)?\\nProject manager answer: Yes.\\nJokes aside, the advent of generative AI has upended our understanding of what use cases lend themselves best to ML. Historically, we have always leveraged ML for repeatable, predictive patterns in customer experiences, but now, it’s possible to leverage a form of ML even without an entire training dataset.\\nNonetheless, the answer to the question “What customer needs requires an AI solution?” still isn’t always “yes.” Large language models (LLMs) can still be prohibitively expensive for some, and as with all ML models, LLMs are not always accurate. There will always be use cases where leveraging an ML implementation is not the right path forward. How do we as AI project managers evaluate our customers’ needs for AI implementation?\\nThe key considerations to help make this decision include:\\n- The inputs and outputs required to fulfill your customer’s needs: An input is provided by the customer to your product and the output is provided by your product. So, for a Spotify ML-generated playlist (an output), inputs could include customer preferences, and ‘liked’ songs, artists and music genre.\\n- Combinations of inputs and outputs: Customer needs can vary based on whether they want the same or different output for the same or different input. The more permutations and combinations we need to replicate for inputs and outputs, at scale, the more we need to turn to ML versus rule-based systems.\\n- Patterns in inputs and outputs: Patterns in the required combinations of inputs or outputs help you decide what type of ML model you need to use for implementation. If there are patterns to the combinations of inputs and outputs (like reviewing customer anecdotes to derive a sentiment score), consider supervised or semi-supervised ML models over LLMs because they might be more cost-effective.\\n- Cost and Precision: LLM calls are not always cheap at scale and the outputs are not always precise/exact, despite fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Sometimes, you are better off with supervised models for neural networks that can classify an input using a fixed set of labels, or even rules-based systems, instead of using an LLM.\\nI put together a quick table below, summarizing the considerations above, to help project managers evaluate their customer needs and determine whether an ML implementation seems like the right path forward.\\n| Type of customer need | Example | ML Implementation (Yes/No/Depends) | Type of ML Implementation |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Repetitive tasks where a customer needs the same output for the same input | Add my email across various forms online | No | Creating a rules-based system is more than sufficient to help you with your outputs |\\n| Repetitive tasks where a customer needs different outputs for the same input | The customer is in “discovery mode” and expects a new experience when they take the same action (such as signing into an account): — Generate a new artwork per click —StumbleUpon (remember that?) discovering a new corner of the internet through random search | Yes | –Image generation LLMs –Recommendation algorithms (collaborative filtering) |\\n| Repetitive tasks where a customer needs the same/similar output for different inputs | –Grading essays –Generating themes from customer feedback | Depends | If the number of input and output combinations are simple enough, a deterministic, rules-based system can still work for you. However, if you begin having multiple combinations of inputs and outputs because a rules-based system cannot scale effectively, consider leaning on: –Classifiers –Topic modelling But only if there are patterns to these inputs. If there are no patterns at all, consider leveraging LLMs, but only for one-off scenarios (as LLMs are not as precise as supervised models). |\\n| Repetitive tasks where a customer needs different outputs for different inputs | –Answering customer support questions –Search | Yes | It’s rare to come across examples where you can provide different outputs for different inputs at scale without ML. There are just too many permutations for a rules-based implementation to scale effectively. Consider: –LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) –Decision trees for products such as search |\\n| Non-repetitive tasks with different outputs | Review of a hotel/restaurant | Yes | Pre-LLMs, this type of scenario was tricky to accomplish without models that were trained for specific tasks, such as: –Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) –Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) for predicting the next word LLMs are a great fit for this type of scenario. |\\nThe bottom line: Don’t use a lightsaber when a simple pair of scissors could do the trick. Evaluate your customer’s need using the matrix above, taking into account the costs of implementation and the precision of the output, to build accurate, cost-effective products at scale.\\nSharanya Rao is a fintech group product manager.

Utilidata raises $60M to find out.\\nSocial card description: Utilidata and Nvidia think their AI-enabled smart meters can help solve tricky grid challenges, from growing data center demand to more rooftop solar and…\\nNext Upcoming\\nCanary Live Washington D.C.\\nBy Canary Media\\nConversations about AI and the power grid tend to focus on the demands that the developing technology will place on the country’s aging energy infrastructure. But Josh Brumberger, CEO of Utilidata, has a vision for how AI can actually help the grid.\\nThe Rhode Island-based grid technology company is working on what it calls “edge AI intelligence” — smart meters or grid control devices embedded with chipsets designed by leading AI chipmaker Nvidia. Those devices have the computational capacity to process massive amounts of data and make split-second decisions, enabling utilities to better manage increasingly complicated power grids.\\nOn Tuesday, Utilidata announced $60.3 million in funding to expand production and deployment of this technology with a growing list of utility partners. The new round brings Utilidata’s total venture funding to $126.5 million and was led by Renown Capital Partners and joined by existing investor Keyframe Capital, as well as Nvidia and Quanta Services, a major utility grid, energy infrastructure, and data center engineering and services company.\\n“We want to make it as easy as possible for hardware manufacturers to embed AI and distributed intelligence into their devices,” Brumberger said. “There’s this concept that AI is going to be crucial as we go about developing our next-generation infrastructure — in this case, the power grid. We were kind of on the edges of those discussions a few years ago. Now we’re at the center.”\\nUtilidata and Nvidia began to jointly develop their technology in 2021. The next year, they launched a consortium of U.S. utilities, along with leading U.S. residential solar and battery installer Sunrun, to support its deployment.\\nSince then, the technology has been selected to play a role in several cutting-edge utility grid projects.\\nIn 2023, Portland General Electric in Oregon landed a Department of Energy grant to deploy Utilidata and Nvidia’s“grid-edge computing platform” to support its long-running effort to integrate batteries, EVs, and community solar into its grid. Pennsylvania utility Duquesne Light won a similar DOE grant to use the devices to collect data to better assess and mitigate threats to the grid from climate change and extreme weather. And Consumers Energy in Michigan launched a project with Utilidata last year that uses the technology to determine the grid impacts of home EV charging.\\nThe projects share some common features, Brumberger said. They involve collecting massive amounts of data, such as subsecond readings of the voltage and frequency of power flowing through utilities’ distribution grids. Those data must then be processed by integrated circuits running hefty mathematical calculations before grid operators can make use of it.\\nThe in-the-field computers must also be reprogrammable to perform a shifting variety of tasks, rather than “hard-wired” for only a preset range of duties, he said. And those tasks may require autonomous decision-making, like coordinating utility and customer-controlled devices to respond to changing grid circumstances, which is possible only with technology capable of acting faster than traditional low-bandwidth wireless communications from central utility control rooms.\\nUtilidata, which got its start providing grid voltage control equipment to the utility industry, restructured its business in 2020 to focus on these kinds of “grid-edge” challenges. The goal was to develop new versions of long-standing utility technologies that simply don’t have the speed necessary for the modern grid.\\nTake the more than 100 million smart meters deployed across the U.S. since the mid-2000s. Those meters — essentially stripped-down, weatherproofed computers linked via wireless networks — are collecting energy billing data, alerting utilities to power outages, and enabling some basic grid control capabilities today.\\nBut the chipsets in those earlier generations of advanced metering infrastructure — AMI 1.0, in utility parlance — were designed to do a preset list of tasks and to be cheap enough to be deployed in the millions. The underlying computing technology has gotten both cheaper and better since then.\\nMajor smart-meter vendors such as Itron and Landis+Gyr have been boosting the capabilities of their latest “AMI 2.0” systems to carry out increasingly complex activities. Utilidata and Nvidia claim that their technology platform, dubbed “Karman,” exceeds the capabilities of its peers in the field, though their price point is likely higher too. (AMI vendors tend not to disclose per-unit prices, and cost and pricing vary widely depending on order volumes and vagaries of industry demand.)\\nUtilities take a long time to move from testing a technology to deploying it at large scale. Utilidata’s earliest pilot projects, launched in 2022, embedded Nvidia chips in devices that attach to existing meters. Last year, the company signed a deal with Aclara, a longtime smart meter manufacturer and subsidiary of electronics giant Hubbell, to develop an integrated smart meter using the Karman platform.\\nUtilidata and Nvidia’s projects with Portland General Electric, Duquesne Light, and other utility partners aren’t going to completely replace those utilities’ existing smart meters — at least, not right away. Instead, these initial projects are tied to strategic deployments at parts of the grid where the utilities are seeking more granular information, Brumberger said.\\nOne major area of interest is in assessing the grid impacts of rooftop solar systems, backup batteries, EV chargers, and other so-called distributed energy resources, he said. A growing number of utilities are looking for ways to enlist these kinds of devices to reduce strains on their power grids — say, by instructing batteries to store solar power at midday to release it later when it’s more valuable to the grid, or by coordinating when EV charging happens to avoid overloading local grid infrastructure when everyone charges at once.\\nThese virtual power plants (VPPs) or distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) can sometimes be handled in a command-and-control fashion by utility grid operations centers communicating to in-field devices via hard-wired, cellular, or broadband internet. But more advanced tasks require complex computations of local grid conditions and real-time communications between multiple local devices — exactly what Karman was designed to handle, Brumberger said.\\n“How can you have a VPP that’s, from a capacity perspective, as big and as reliable as a gas-fired plant, without accelerating computing and AI? You’ve got so many disparate resources that have so much untapped value that we ultimately have to unlock,” he said.\\nPortland General Electric, which is planning to rely on distributed energy resources for a significant chunk of its future grid needs, sees technologies like Karman as a way to better understand the reliability of VPPs and DERMS, Ananth Sundaram, senior manager of integrated grid at Portland General Electric, told Canary Media in a 2023 interview.\\n“We can look at grid services, we can look at disaggregation of the power, and what customer behavior and customer signatures we can track,” he said. “That will not only provide us a solid platform for serving our clients, it also helps us harvest massive amounts of data we need to understand what exactly is happening on the grid edge.”\\nUtilidata is hoping that utilities and regulators will keep these future needs in mind when planning the next cycle of large-scale smart meter deployments. Brumberger noted that Quanta, a new investor in the latest funding round, is a key partner in many large-scale utility infrastructure and smart meter deployments.\\nUtilidata’s near-term deployments are also dependent on the Trump administration preserving the DOE grants supporting its first-of-a-kind utility projects. The administration has frozen and threatened to end federal climate and energy funding approved during the Biden administration, as well as to eliminate large swaths of the federal workforce, including DOE offices that manage these grant programs.\\n“We have not received any word that those projects are not happening,” Brumberger said about the grants. “If you sort of peel back the layers of our project, at its core, it’s next-generation AI infrastructure. That theme does seem central to this administration, when they talk about winning the AI race, about hardening our critical infrastructure.”\\nThe latest round of funding will allow Utilidata to expand to new markets, both outside the U.S. and outside the utility grid, Brumberger said. In particular, it’s exploring the prospects for embedding its Nvidia-enabled distributed energy control devices within data centers themselves, enabling them to better understand and control power usage down to the server level, he said.\\n“We think of data centers as incredibly powerful microgrids,” he said — a perspective shared by data center developers adding generators, batteries, and energy management controls to their massive installations.\\nUtilidata and Nvidia’s computing platforms will also be collecting, analyzing, and “training” from the data they’re collecting, much like large language models (LLMs) “train” on massive amounts of human-generated text and images, Brumberger noted. The data might include things like differences between the grid voltage signals that accompany power disruptions caused by people turning things on and off in their homes and those caused by external impacts like tree branches hitting power lines.\\n“It’s no longer just a sensor, but a little hub of activity where you can train locally, so not every piece of information needs to leave the site,” he said. “The question is going to be, is this the kind of tech you need on 10% of your territory, on 50%, on 80%, or 100%?”\\nJeff St. John is chief reporter and policy specialist at Canary Media. He covers innovative grid technologies, rooftop solar and batteries, clean hydrogen, EV charging, and more.\\nBefore you go!\\nSign up for our free newsletter.\\nI love this article because grid edge AI can Integrate a residence with an EV, solar PV, a home battery, home electrical equipment, a smart power meter and the local grid.

Tech-military contracts totaled at least $53 billion between 2018 and 2022, creating powerful business incentives despite potential reputational risks 4.\\nWang’s relatively smooth navigation of these waters so far, with Scale AI growing to a $13.8 billion valuation while maintaining military partnerships, represents an exception rather than the rule in an industry often divided over defense work.'}\n",

AI can simulate answers, but only humans wonder why. \\nIn a time when artificial intelligence can write code, analyze data, and even mimic human conversation, it’s easy to wonder what’s left that machines can’t do. But there is one capability that continues to separate humans from machines, curiosity. AI can synthesize information faster than any person and even simulate questions based on patterns. What it cannot do is wonder. It cannot seek the unknown for its own sake. And that single skill, human curiosity, is not only irreplaceable but increasingly essential.\\nCuriosity fuels innovation, drives learning, and inspires the questions that lead to breakthroughs. It is curiosity that leads us to discover new medicines, re-imagine business models, and challenge the status quo. As Bill Gates noted in his book, Source Code: My Beginnings, “Curiosity can't be satisfied in a vacuum, of course. It requires nurturing, resources, guidance, support.” He credits his parents for answering his endless stream of questions and encouraging his interests, turning a natural trait into a lifelong advantage. That kind of support is what AI lacks, and what humans thrive on.\\nWhy Curiosity Matters More in the Age of AI\\nThere was a time when knowing the answers made someone valuable. But now, having the right questions is what sets leaders apart. AI is trained to find answers from data it already has. Humans can ask the questions no one thought to explore.\\nThis is where curiosity becomes a leadership differentiator. It opens the door to better decisions, more inclusive workplaces, and adaptable cultures. In a world that prizes efficiency, curiosity may feel like a luxury, but it's a survival skill. And while AI can process vast datasets, it lacks the desire to challenge assumptions or explore without instruction.\\nWhat AI Curiosity Really Means And What It Misses\\nThere is such a thing as “artificial curiosity.” In fact, one of the more interesting AI experiments came from researchers trying to teach machines how to learn autonomously. In a well-known study, researchers gave an AI agent the goal of exploring levels of a Mario Brothers–style video game without being told what the reward was. The AI used an intrinsic motivation model to keep exploring new territory. It looked like curiosity—but it wasn’t. It was a reward function.\\nWhen I interviewed Dr. Cindy Gordon, CEO of SalesChoice and a global AI thought leader, she emphasized that AI models only reflect the data and the parameters we give them. What appears to be innovation is actually optimization. “AI doesn’t think in the abstract or emotional layers that humans do,” she said. “It follows what it’s fed.”\\nThat means true curiosity, the kind that challenges the premise of the question itself, is still uniquely human.\\nHow Curiosity Powers Strategic Thinking In The AI-Focused Workplace\\nWhen I spoke with futurist and sociobiologist Rebecca Costa, she explained that adaptation happens faster when individuals are curious. Her work has shown that the most successful leaders are not necessarily those with the most knowledge, but those with the most drive to explore what they don’t know yet.\\nIn complex environments, it’s not possible to know everything. Curiosity fills the gap. It helps professionals make sense of uncertainty by asking better questions. It fuels resilience, because the curious mind doesn’t get stuck when plans shift, it gets interested. This mindset is critical in an era where AI automates the predictable and humans must master the uncertain.\\nWhy Curiosity Needs Support To Thrive And AI Doesn’t\\nUnlike machines, humans need a supportive environment to explore. That includes psychological safety, leadership encouragement, and a culture that rewards questions rather than just answers. Curiosity declines when people are punished for speaking up or when their ideas are routinely ignored.\\nAI does not require motivation, safety, or encouragement to run its models. But humans do. That means organizations that want to stay competitive must invest in the conditions that keep curiosity alive. That includes hiring for openness, recognizing inquiry, and modeling exploration from the top down.\\nCuriosity Can’t Be Coded Like AI, But It Can Be Cultivated\\nOne of the biggest myths is that people are either curious or they aren’t. In reality, curiosity is a muscle. It can be developed with practice and supported through leadership. When organizations create space for reflection, learning, and experimentation, they cultivate a workforce that can adapt, and even thrive, alongside AI.\\nAs Dr. Gordon shared during our conversation, the future will belong to those who can collaborate with AI while still thinking beyond its capabilities. That’s why curiosity isn’t a soft skill. It’s a strategic skill. It helps people interpret nuance, evaluate risk, and consider second-order consequences that machines might miss.\\nNeuroscientist Beau Lotto, who I interviewed about perception and creativity, adds another layer. He explained that true curiosity is driven by a desire to resolve uncertainty, not just collect information. In other words, curiosity is about the courage to confront the unknown and challenge what we believe to be true.\\nWhat Leaders Must Do To Prioritize Human Curiosity In An AI World\\nLeaders can’t assume that curiosity will happen on its own. It must be intentional. That starts with:\\n- Creating space for questions during meetings, not just updates\\n- Encouraging employees to explore cross-functional ideas\\n- Rewarding experimentation, even when it doesn’t produce immediate results\\n- Offering training that builds critical thinking, not just compliance\\nIn short, if your employees feel they must always be right, they will never ask the bold questions that lead to real breakthroughs.\\nCuriosity Is What Makes Us Human And More Valuable Than AI\\nThe rise of AI doesn’t diminish the value of human talent. It redefines it. The best professionals won’t be the ones who memorize the most or respond the fastest. They will be the ones who know how to pause, wonder, and look beyond the obvious. AI may power the future, but curiosity shapes it. And that’s a distinctly human advantage worth protecting.\"}\n",

It (and the update to it) have been all the rage lately, among “AI forecasters”, on social media, and it has even made it into mainstream media like the Financial Times.\\nSome of it makes sense, and some if it doesn’t.\\nThe first version dropped on March 19, METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research — a non-profit research lab that was created in December 2023) — published a report on a study they had done, measuring the ability of large language models to carry out software-related task. They also tweeted the following:\\nThe tweet took off, and then on April16, OpenAI released its new models o3 and o4-mini. METR carried out their tests on these models, added them to the graph, and found that “AI” was improving even faster than it had reported in March.\\nExtrapolating from neatly drawn graphs, people are tweeting things like, “Within 12 months, AI will do a reasonable job on most >1hr messiest cognitive tasks” – a claim that in our view doesn’t even pass the “circle the r’s in Strawberry” sniff test.\\n§\\nSome of the work that went into the METR graph is actually terrific, carried out with exemplary care, adhering scrupulously to best practices. The technical report was, for the most part, responsibly written, carefully describing the scope of the findings and giving suitable, appropriate warnings about potential gaps.\\nMETR’s blog and its tweets (perhaps written by publicists or by generative AI rather than by scientists), however, dropped the careful qualifications and nuance of the technical paper and made claims that go far beyond anything that the study actually supports. These were further amplified in the Twitter echo chamber.\\nAlas, the whole thing was based on a flawed premise.\\n§\\nEverything started with good intentions. The scientists at METR set themselves the task of studying how the performance of large language on software-oriented tasks has improved over time – certainly an important question. They put together a collection of 107 problems related to programming and software engineering. The problem collection was constructed with admirable care; they were proposed, vetted, and edited by experts in a multicycle, laborious process. Most of the problems in the datasets are unpublished, to prevent their being used for training future models. However, METR has published some examples on their github site, and judging by those, they have created a diverse collection of interesting, often challenging, problems of high quality. Here, for instance, is the summary of one:\\nThe task is to implement functions to process payments and avoid duplicate transactions when they are coming in asynchronously from different time zones and currencies. Two payments have to be matched based on fuzzy rules such as time difference across time zones and multi step currency conversions.\\nThere are many edge cases and tricky details to get right, and the most difficult version (\"full\") involves setting up all rules related to handling timezones.\\nThe complete problem specification is 3000 words long – well worth looking at to get a sense of what is really involved in a moderately complex software engineering undertaking.\\nTo make a quantitative analysis of their study, METR needed to have a quantitative measure of the difficulty of the problems that a model can address – the y-axis on the graphs at the start of the article.\\nThat’s where things started to get weird. First, they decided to characterize the difficulty of each problem in terms of the time that a human expert takes to solve it; for instance, it is recorded in the dataset that human experts take an average of 23 hours 37 minutes to write the payment processing code. Then they decided to measure the quality of an AI system in terms of the time-demands of problems that the system gets 50% correct. For instance, according to the graph, GPT-4 scores 50% correct on problems that people take 4 minutes to solve. So the y-axis value for GPT-4 is 4 minutes.\\nThis combination of duration and accuracy leads to a very weird and arbitrary measure. For instance: The first graph says that the task “question answering” takes 15 seconds; “count words in passage” takes 2 minutes, and “find fact on web” takes 11 minutes. Presumably1, METR doesn’t mean that these tasks in general take that long; those are the average human times for the particular instances of those tasks in the dataset. However, if we consider these tasks in general, then the time for humans to carry them out depends on a zillion different factors. The time that people take to count words in their native language depends almost purely on the length of the passage. If they are asked to count words written in an alphabet with unfamiliar conventions for word breaks, it takes much longer. The time that people take to answer a question depends on all kinds of things; how long is the question, how complex is the reasoning process needed to solve the question, how well do the people know the subject matter, how experienced are they in answering this particular kind of question, what resources or tools do they have access to, and so on. It is not credible that the 50% success rate tracks these combinations of factors with any precision. In other words, the 4-minute mark for GPT-4 is completely arbitrary; you could probably put together one reasonable collection of word counting and question answering tasks with average human time of 30 seconds and another collection with an average human time of 20 minutes where GPT-4 would hit 50% accuracy on each.2 And it would be absurd to say that o3 can do all tasks that humans can do in 1.7 hours or that GPT-3 could do anything that a person can do in 15 seconds\\nBluntly, the Y-axis simply doesn’t make much sense. And needless to say, if the Y-axis doesn’t make sense, you can’t meaningfully use the graph to make predictions. Computers can answer some questions reliably now, for example, and some not, and the graph tells us nothing about which is which or when any specific question will be solved. Or consider songwriting; Dylan wrote some in an afternoon; Leonard Cohen took half a decade on and off to write Hallelujah. Should we average the two figures? Should we sample Dylan songs more heavily because he wrote more of them? Where should songwriting go on the figure? The whole thing strikes us as absurd.\\nFinally, the only thing METR looked at was “software tasks”. Software might be very different from other domains, in which case the graph (even it did make sense) might not apply. In the technical paper, the authors actually get this right: they discuss carefully the possibility that the tasks used for testing might not be representative of real-world software engineering tasks. They certainly don\\'t claim that the findings of the paper apply to tasks in general. But the social media posts make that unwarranted leap.\\nThat giant leap seems especially unwarranted given that there has likely been a lot of recent data augmentation directed towards software benchmarks in particular (where this is feasible). In other domains where direct, verifiable augmentation is less feasible, results might be quite different. (Witness the failed letter ‘r’ labeling task depicted above.) Unfortunately, literally none of the tweets we saw even considered the possibility that a problematic graph specific to software tasks might not generalize to literally all other aspects of cognition.\\nWe can only shake our heads.\\n§\\nThe datasets of software-engineering problems that METR has created are potentially very valuable. Some of the qualitative discussions of the limitations of the current technology on these problems is interesting. The paper is worth reading.\\nBut attempting to use the graph to make predictions about the capacities of future AI is misguided, and the fact that it went viral is a sign that in AI (as in so many other domains) people are repeating things that they want to believe, based on their alleged conclusions rather than their validity.\\nGary Marcus and Ernest Davis miss the days in which peer review was taken seriously.\\nThe technical paper itself does not include the now famous graph or any discussion of those tasks. This is our best shot at making sense of what these labels on the graph might possibly mean. It is not clear whether “count words in a passage” means the task of counting the words in some specified passage or the task of writing code to count the words in a passage.\\nThe METR technical paper justifies the use of “average human time” in terms of a theory of the “messiness” of tasks. Their argument is as follows. (A) Large language models do better on unmessy tasks than on messy ones. (B) Human time to carry out a task is an approximate measure of messiness. They describe “messiness” in tasks as “, environments without clear feedback loops, or where the agent needs to proactively seek out relevant information.” But all of this is widely simplistic, and counterexamples abound. For example, counting words in a passage is an unmessy task (unix has done it virtually flawlessly for decades) But counting words in a long passage takes humans a long and passages of only a dozen words flummoxed early versions of GPT.. More recent versions still have trouble with longer texts. Characterizing texts in terms of messiness just doesn’t tell us much; many, many other factors are at play.\\n“We can only shake our heads.”\\nIndeed. Never mind that exponential growth only happens until it doesn’t. Which means that extrapolating an exponential curve without understanding what is driving the growth and when that drive might run out is nothing more than a wet finger in the wind.\\nThe confirmation bias and echo chamber amplifies the hype. I attended a AI conference, the trend I noticed is this is more among investors than builders. Builders see the reality when they build applications (even if not all), but investors only seem to see what they want to see.'}\n",

Trump’s action drew rebukes from a group representing Catholic bishops in New York and among Italians.\\nThe image, shared Friday night on Trump’s Truth Social site and later reposted by the White House on its official X account, raised eyebrows on social media and at the Vatican, which is still in the period of nine days of official mourning following Francis’ death on April 21. Catholic cardinals have been celebrating daily Masses in his memory and are due to open the conclave to elect his successor on Wednesday.\\nThe death of a pope and election of another is a matter of utmost solemnity for Catholics, for whom the pope is Christ’s vicar on Earth. That is all the more true in Italy, where the papacy is held in high esteem even by nonreligious Italians.\\nThe image featuring Trump in a white cassock and pointed miter, or bishop’s hat, was the topic of several questions during the Vatican’s daily conclave briefing Saturday. Italian and Spanish news reports lamented its poor taste and said it was offensive, given that the period of official mourning is still underway.\\nLeft-leaning former Premier Matteo Renzi said the image was shameful. “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,” Renzi wrote on X. “Meanwhile, the U.S. economy risks recession and the dollar loses value. The sovereignists are doing damage, everywhere.”\\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to comment.\\nIn the United States, the New York State Catholic Conference, which represents the bishops of the state in working with government, accused Trump of mockery.\\n“There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,” they wrote. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.”\\nItaly’s left-leaning La Repubblica also featured the image on its homepage Saturday with a commentary accusing Trump of “pathological megalomania.”\\nAsked to respond to the criticism, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, “President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.”\\nJack Posobiec, a prominent far-right influencer and Trump ally who recently participated in a Catholic prayer event in March at Trump’s Florida resort, also defended the president.\\n“I’m Catholic. We’ve all been making jokes about the upcoming Pope selection all week. It’s called a sense of humor,” he wrote on X.\\nThe episode comes after Trump joked last week about his interest in the vacancy. “I’d like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,” the thrice married president, who is not Catholic, told reporters.\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, piled on.\\n“I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope. This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!” Graham, R-S.C., wrote on X. “The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides. Watching for white smoke…. Trump MMXXVIII!”\\nVice President JD Vance, who is Catholic and was one of the last foreign officials to meet with Francis before the pope died, also joked about Secretary of State Marco Rubio becoming pope, suggesting Rubio could add it to the long list of titles he holds, including national security adviser and acting archivist.\\nBeyond floating himself for the job, Trump also has put in a plug for Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York.\\n“I have no preference. I must say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out a place called New York who’s very good. So we’ll see what happens,” he said.\\nDolan, 75, is one of 10 U.S. cardinals who will be voting in the conclave, but Trump’s pitch might have cost Dolan support.\\nThe reason conclaves are held in secrecy, with cardinals sequestered for the duration, is to prevent outside secular powers from influencing their choice, as occurred in centuries past.\\nThere is an old saying about campaigning for the job of pope or of being promoted excessively, especially by outsiders: If you “enter a conclave as pope, you leave as a cardinal.”\\nWhile Trump attended Francis’ funeral, he and Vance have clashed with U.S. bishops in general and Francis in particular over the administration’s hard line stance on immigration and its efforts to deport migrants en masse. Right before he was hospitalized in February for pneumonia, Francis issued a strong rebuke of the administration’s mass deportation plans and Vance’s theological justification of it.\\nOver 12 years as pope, Francis tried to remake the U.S. Catholic hierarchy more in his image, elevating pastors who prioritized social justice and migration issues over culture warriors who were more favored by his more doctrinaire predecessors St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI. A new pope who is more conservative could reverse that effort.\\nTrump has nominated as his ambassador to the Holy See Brian Burch, whose Catholicvote.org has been aggressively covering the pre-conclave days at the Vatican. It was one of the main disseminators in English-speaking media of a report, flatly and officially denied by the Vatican, that Cardinal Pietro Parolin had had a health scare this past week that required medical attention.\\nParolin was the secretary of state under Francis and is seen as a leading contender to be pope. He is also the main architect of the Vatican’s China policy and its controversial 2018 deal with Beijing over bishop nominations -- a deal that the was sharply criticized by the first Trump administration.\\n___ Winfield reported from Vatican City.'}\n",

Some consumer advocates argue that individual people who are so often being targeted by businesses and government activities need their own AI agents to defend them.\\nWhen Alex “Sandy” Pentland took the stage at this year‘s Imagination in Action event, he was talking about specifically this type of thing.\\n“They're going to try and hack me, do bad things to me,” he said of those ubiquitous agents controlled by business, government or big interest parties. “They are going to twist my mind around politics, all of those things. And my answer to this is I need an AI agent to defend me. I need something who's on my side who can help me navigate returning things or avoiding scams, or all that whole sort of thing.”\\nThe idea that Pentland describes is that your AI agent addresses all of that other agent activity that’s aimed at you, and intervenes on your behalf.\\nYour Digital Defender\\nThe idea of a personal “digital defender” in the form of an AI agent is not very widely talked about on the web. Pentland’s video is up there, but you don’t see much about the specific type of project in research papers, or on corporate sites, or even at Consumer Reports (more on this later).\\nIn a way, it’s like having a public defender in court. There’s a legal effort against you, so you need your own advocacy to represent you on your side. Although some might call these attorneys “public pretenders” due to underpayment, short staffing, or other problems, hopefully the AI agent is more effective in a global sense.\\nIt’s also sort of like consumer reporting – Pentland mentioned how Consumer Reports has been doing this kind of work for 80 years with polls and other tools.\\n“This is why we have seat belts in cars,” he said. “At Consumer Reports, what they do is, they pull all their people, they do tests and things like that to find good products. That's what I want, is, I want somebody who's on my side that way.”\\nAnother sort of similar idea is cybersecurity agents who are created by a company called Twine that are intended to protect people from cyberattacks.\\nBut all that aside, Pentland’s idea is still in its infancy.\\nGetting Buy-In\\nIn fact, one of the most interesting parts of his presentation was when he talked about all of these business people making their way into one room to talk about personal AI defense agents.\\n“We had C-level representation, the head of AI products for every single major AI producer, show up on one week’s notice,” he explained. “We also had all the payers show up … people (who handle) credit cards, etc. We had all the systems guys show up. Now (you’re in a) little room with more C-level people than you've ever seen in your entire life. Very busy people who showed up on one week’s notice.”\\nIt’s largely liability, he suggested, that brought them to the table\\n“If they're going to deploy these things, and they're going to be interacting with you, they had better not cheat, they’d better not be biased, or scam you,” he said. “They have a lot of liability, legal liability, as well as reputational liability. They have to be fair in helping you do things, otherwise they're going to end up in class action courts. That's what they wanted. They wanted someone to build a standard best practice personal agent.”\\nHe mentioned a couple of caveats: the agentic system has to undergo legal testing. Ideally, it should be hosted in academia to show impartiality. While best practices are good, he said, companies and other parties really want a standard, because a standard is bulletproof.\\nCrowdsourcing AI Protection\\nPentland also talked about a sort of digital populism that’s appealing to those who feel like there’s strength in numbers.\\n“You’re just you,” he said. “But if there were a million yous, or 10 million yous, all (of them) trying to get a good deal, avoid scams, fill out that legal form, you could actually have Ais that are competitive with the best results. So that solves the own, your own data problem (pretty well).”\\nAdvice for Young People\\nIn response to questions, Pentland went over some advice for those who are just starting their careers now. Part of it had to do with solving big questions around how these defense agents will work.\\n“How do I know what’s good for me, and what I want?” he asked, raising some of the essential questions of how an AI agent can target its efforts correctly, according to the user’s preference and welfare.\\nHe also brought up questions around how to put agents together, to build toward what he called a “network effect” that magnifies what a connected system of agents can do.\\nHe also talked about another kind of game theory where it’s easy to upset the apple cart with just a small adjustment.\\nEssentially, Pentland argued, a bad actor can easily throw a system out of balance by being “just a little edgy,” by making small changes that lead to a domino effect that can be detrimental.\\nHe used the example of a traffic jam, which starts off as just one car in dense traffic changing its behavior. This type of game theory, he asserted, has to be factored into how we create our digital defense agent networks.\\nWith all of this in mind, it’s probably a good idea to think about building those digital defense agents. They might not be perfect right away, but they might be the defense that we need against an emerging army of hackers utilizing some of the most potent technologies we’ve ever seen. The idea also feeds back into the whole debate about open source and closed source models, and when tools should be published for all the world to use. It’s imperative to keep a lid on the types of bad actors that could otherwise jeopardize systems. In the cryptocurrency days, we had the notion of a 51% attack, where as soon as somebody held more than half of a given blockchain item, they had full control, with no exceptions.\\nThe solution to our AI liability might be something like this. Look for this type of research to continue.\"}\n",

Here’s what the US can learn from its success in cutting red tape.\\nRed tape and bureaucratic nonsense are staples of American government, whether in small towns, major metropolises, or the federal level. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, federal red tape alone costs the public 11.6 billion hours annually. That amounts to nearly 35 hours per citizen yearly, translating to a staggering $117 billion or 0.6% of GDP, drained not by inefficiency but by outdated systems. In contrast, the Estonia Digital Government Model offers a powerful example of how to eliminate bureaucracy and deliver efficient, AI-powered public services.\\nBureaucratic headaches in the U.S. have become as predictable as death and taxes. But what if there was a better way to solve this constant impediment to proper growth and progress that’s already working? I recently had the privilege of sitting down with Prime Minister Kristen Michal of Estonia, where we explored how his country has built one of the most advanced digital governments on the planet, which is nearly 100% digitized, citizen-first, and powered by AI.\\nEstonia’s model isn’t just a curiosity. It’s a potential playbook for how the United States could reimagine governance, slash inefficiencies, and unlock productivity at scale.\\nEstonia Becomes Fully Digital, Eliminating “Bureaucrazy”\\nEstonia’s Prime Minister Kristen Michals has ushered in a new era by creating a citizen-centric government, working to eliminate nearly all bureaucracy towards a goal of 100% digitalization of its government services. This push began in 2015-2016 with a project called Zero Bureaucracy. The group behind this were ministers and entrepreneurs who identified the obstacles of working with the Estonian government. Despite a stall in the early 2020s, the project has delivered. According to Prime Minister Michals, “Almost 100% of our services are online, and we already have more than 130 examples of usage of AI in public services. They are predictive, personalized, and proactive. Let\\'s say, for example, if a kid is born, after that, you will have everything online already, no physical forms and so on… And with everything else, it\\'s the same.”\\nImagine never being handed a clipboard again when you enter the doctor’s office. They have all your info in their database, so you never have to repeat yourself. You only need to complete an online form when you have a significant change in insurance or medical condition.\\nBenefits to Business Owners\\nThis model of filing and processing every form and application online and digitally is a windfall for business owners and entrepreneurs. The Prime Minister added that all business owners “take less time on bureaucracy and more time on their own enterprise, because we have this kind of real-time economic solution…(completely implemented by \\'27), which will spare about $132 million for Estonian businesses on just filling the forms” and time savings.\\nThis type of AI and digital implementation in the United States would make every business immediately more efficient. Contractors applying for permits, awaiting feedback, and scheduling follow-up will see lessened waits and lag time in completing projects. Entrepreneurs would see real savings when applying for business licenses, filing corporate taxes, managing payroll, and handling unemployment claims entirely digitally and in real time.\\nEstonia’s thriving AI ecosystem is already driving this transformation across global enterprises. Kaspar Korjus, CEO of Pactum AI, a leading Estonian AI company whose clients include Walmart, Maersk, and other Fortune 500 firms, explains: “Pactum AI Agents are transforming the operating models of global enterprises by inviting Agents to work alongside procurement professionals. While you read this article, your agents negotiated with your suppliers and generated hard savings for you across your supplier base. Agents have time to give a chance to every supplier, no matter how strategic or transactional one is. In many ways, we see that we will transcend the limits of humans, and thus we learn to become better humans ourselves.”\\nEducation and Future-proofing the Population\\nEstonia has focused on adopting a curriculum to keep up with rapid AI advancements while fostering critical thinking and creativity. Kristina Kallas, Minister of Education and Research for Estonia said, \"Estonia\\'s economic competitiveness depends on how well we can prepare young people for the age of artificial intelligence.” This type of long-term thinking and governmental dedication is the type of action that sets up Estonia for decades of success. In the United States, we are sometimes shackled to election cycles and the short-sightedness of politicians who care first and foremost about being re-elected.\\nI asked the Prime Minister how these successes could be modeled in the United States, and how this could be exported or shared internationally with other countries?\\n“By 2027, one-third of our teachers and students will be learning and using AI tools. If you use AI tools smarter than anybody else, you will probably be a winner…Usually, success stories can be exported. If we are successful in the things we do, … we\\'ll have one-third of our students and teachers using AI tools. And if we succeed in doing that, our example will probably be used worldwide.”\\nBut AI still must be introduced and taught as a tool, not anything more. It is not the end-all be-all to knowledge, replacing education. The ability to think, reason, and problem solve is still a core competency in Estonia’s educational system.\\n“Let’s say, AI provides all the answers, keeping a critical mind in today\\'s world … is very tough. But it comes from the school curriculum that you should always question facts and use the facts, not just read the headlines and the answers given…This kind of AI lead we\\'re giving to our educators, students and so on, and also using this in businesses and with research and development, will help a lot.”\\nJevgeni Kabanov, President at Bolt is bullish on the nation’s ability to create strong mutually beneficial partnerships between the government and private business to further education. Kabanov said that “Estonia continues to lead by example by showing how public-private partnerships can facilitate the adoption of new technologies. This has been highlighted most recently by TI-Hüpe (AI-Leap), an educational program which will provide Estonian school students and teachers with free access to AI learning applications.”\\nEmployment and Jobs\\nOne of the most significant worries globally with AI is how it will affect the labor market. Frightening statistics state that AI will replace 9.1% of jobs worldwide, but on the other side of that coin, 83% of employers state that a worker who has skills using AI will be retained.\\nEstonia\\'s approach to this coming global change has been to invest in its population via upskilling. In 2023, the government earmarked over $10 million (9 million Euros) to advance knowledge and skills in the production, engineering, technology, and IT sectors.\\n“The only way is to work smarter, not in quantity, but in quality. And AI is helping in that… Estonia’s economy was in decline for two years. Right now, it\\'s starting to grow, and growth is also predicted for the next years,” the prime minister added.\\nThe ability to leverage AI and use it to help work smarter and more efficiently is the direction Estonia is directing its workforce. “Future jobs won’t be taken by artificial intelligence, but by people who know how to use it better,” said Linnar Viik, AI Leap initiator, Estonian technology expert, entrepreneur, and one of the key architects behind Estonia’s digital society. This is a success and a message the United States should look to mirror and apply nationwide, get the workforce to understand the plethora of opportunities AI can provide them as they build a career and life.\\n“I see AI as a way to increase productivity per person. That is probably the only way for Estonia to go up in the global value chain and pass some countries on the way,” is the Prime Minister’s take on this subject.\\nPotential Drawbacks and Obstacles\\nPotential pitfalls when digitizing any part of a business or government include threats from foreign bad actors, data breaches, and a lack of computational power. Only 42% of Estonians believe the EU effectively protects their digital rights. Add to that the fact that only 76.9% of homes in Estonia have very high-capacity network (VHCN) coverage, which is below the overall EU average of nearly 79% and you can see that despite all of the impressive work that has been done, there is still more to do in terms of trust and infrastructure.\\nThe government\\'s plan is not to go alone but to develop a strong public-private partnership.\\nPrime Minister Kristen Michal said, “For us, we know that we as a state, have a good partner in the private sector, which is helping us and also giving critical feedback; what is needed, what can be done better, and so on.” He went on to add, “We have every day to be wary of Russian and different players attacking… one would imagine that during the Ukraine aggression from Russia’s side, that the attacks against European countries and also on Estonia would go down. But no, they have gone up.”\\nThe Estonian government demands and requires all public officials and employees to use only authorized devices on secure networks. This diligence can also be exported to the United States. All levels of government should mandate that all communications occur only on secured devices, networks, and via secure and approved applications.\\nDespite its digital leadership, Estonia is not without economic hurdles. Estonia’s GDP only grew by only 1.2% in Q4 of 2024. This was driven by 3.5% inflation, falling exports, and wage pressure. They are forecasted to recover, but it will be a slow process. The government must make difficult financial decisions around increased military spending due to the Russian attack on Ukraine, plus public debt and the need to reform their tax code, designed in the early 1990s, which led to income inequality. The economy overall has a high dependence on foreign trade, which can cause uncertainty due to regional tensions.\\nGlobal Partnerships on Your Terms\\nIn the US, a group of tech companies called the Magnificent Seven dominates the industry. In Estonia, they collaborate with technology giants such as OpenAI and Anthropic, and others. Estonia has dedicated itself to balancing innovation while maintaining national sovereignty and data security. When asked the Prime Minister how they do this, his answer was simple and profound.\\n“To make it very simple, it means that we work with global AI leaders, but that\\'s as much as possible on our own terms…That means that data stays protected, and local as much as possible. We built custom tools for Estonia; the AI is also responsible and transparent by design. As much as possible, everything is in that world. So, sovereign (AI) does not mean isolation, but it means working on your own terms. And as you can probably imagine, as we know the technology, we also know the threats.”\\nNot being tied to any tech company or group of companies can also be mirrored. Relying too much on one leaves you vulnerable and at their mercy. The government must set the terms, and always keep options and avenues open to negotiate or leave when they feel it is needed for the safety and benefit of the nation. To quote Honorable Alar Karis, the President of Estonia, “We won’t use artificial intelligence the most, but we’ll use it the smartest.”\\nEstonia proves that government can be fast, efficient, and citizen-first with vision, leadership, and the proper digital infrastructure. The Estonia Digital Government Model is not just a success story—it’s a roadmap. The U.S. doesn’t lack the talent or technology, but it lacks the will to act. It’s time to move from red tape to real-time, before we fall too far behind.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 57, {'article': \"Page title: World Press Freedom Day: Caribbean media faces new challenges in the age of AI · Global Voices\\nSocial card title: World Press Freedom Day: Caribbean media faces new challenges in the age of AI\\nSocial card description: Regional media organisations cite the “urgent” need to address the transformative impact of AI on journalism within the context of unique challenges of “media viability, misinformation, and natural disasters.”\\nWorld Press Freedom Day, annually observed on May 3, is a poignant reminder of the need for press freedom, an occasion to remember the sacrifices made in pursuit of that freedom, and an opportunity for journalists and media practitioners to consider any issues that may be of concern to the fourth estate.\\nThis year, the concern being explored in the World Press Freedom Day signature event is the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the media. Discussions will centre around how to ensure that AI enhances, rather than undermines, press freedom and democratic values.\\nAI tools, while transformative in terms of efficiency, multilingualism and data analysis, among other processes, also raise unique ethical questions. AI-generated misinformation and disinformation, deepfake technology, biased content moderation, and surveillance threats to journalists represent just some of the risks, not to mention their potential effects on the industry's business model and what it may mean for the media's long-term viability.\\nUnderstanding the pressing nature of these issues, Global Voices recently shared its own policy on the use of AI in the newsroom. The Media Institute of the Caribbean (MIC), meanwhile, issued a press release in which it underscored the “urgent” need to address the transformative impact of AI on journalism within the context of the region’s unique challenges of “media viability, misinformation, and natural disasters.”\\nThe natural disasters angle also fed into the theme of the 2025 World Press Freedom Day, which dealt with journalism in the face of the global environmental crisis. To this point, the Media Association of Trinidad and Tobago (MATT) noted that “the press is not only a defender of democracy, but also a guardian of our collective future.”\\nThat future must undoubtedly include the use of AI, but the question remains how to manage it ethically and responsibly. According to MIC, regional collaboration is critical to “harness AI’s potential while safeguarding democratic discourse”:\\nAI is reshaping journalism globally, but its implications are acute in the Caribbean, where media ecosystems face structural vulnerabilities. While AI tools offer opportunities for automated reporting, data analysis, and audience engagement, they also risk deepening existing inequities. Caribbean newsrooms are already strained by shrinking advertising revenues. (It is noteworthy that between 15 and 25% of such revenues are diverted to platforms like Meta and Google Ads). There also exist fragile economies to which we now add the need to grapple with AI-driven content saturation.\\nAlgorithmic curation on social media platforms poses a further threat, “as free, AI-generated content competes with costly, human-produced news.” Will Caribbean newsrooms, with their smaller markets operating within vulnerable island economies, be able to withstand the pressure? President of the MIC Kiran Maharaj suggested, “AI could democratise information access, but without guardrails, it may erode the financial sustainability of Caribbean media. We must advocate for equitable AI governance that prioritises public interest journalism.”\\nThe MIC statement went on to note that “the Caribbean is not immune to AI-fuelled misinformation, which exacerbates social divisions and undermines trust in institutions.”\\nIn 2023, the organisation, in conjunction with the Association for Caribbean Media Workers (ACM), conducted a study about the ways in which disinformation targeted regional elections and public health campaigns. MIC Vice President and ACM Co-Founder Wesley Gibbings suggested that “Caribbean media must adopt AI-driven verification tools and invest in digital literacy programs,” adding, “Our survival depends on retaining public trust through accuracy and transparency.”\\nSuch challenges have been further exacerbated by the region's susceptibility to natural disasters, whereby hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and other climate-related events disrupt media operations but put a strain on financial resources. Case in point: the particularly arduous hurricane seasons the Caribbean faced between 2017 and 2024, which the MIC said laid bare “the fragility of media infrastructures and the urgent need for disaster preparedness and resilience planning.”\\nWhereas “blending traditional knowledge with AI-enhanced forecasting and real-time alerts can be pivotal in disaster response,” misuse of AI via misinformation, etc., can also make such situations worse. The solutions the MIC proposed include policies aimed at taxing tech giants and reinvesting the proceeds into journalism, exploring AI-driven revenue models, and, as per UNESCO’s AI Road Map Policy, establishing a regional AI Ethics Task Force. Such a body, it proposes, would “audit algorithms for bias and promote content verification standards [to] provide needed insight for key regulatory and policy making decisions.”\\nAs far as disaster preparedness goes — a pressing issue for small island developing states (SIDS) like the Caribbean that are at the frontline of the climate crisis — the MIC suggested integrating AI tools into national emergency protocols, including media as first responders, and expanding community media networks by offering training and support.\\nAs the MIC looked towards a future in which AI could be turned “into an ally for press freedom and democratic resilience,” however, MATT placed its focus on the here and now, thanking the media personnel who covered Trinidad and Tobago's recent general elections “with professionalism, courage, dedication, resilience, and a commitment to truth,” and flagging issues that “threaten journalistic independence and integrity, including political pressures, harassment of media workers, and barriers to accessing public information.”\\nCurrent challenges include “the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media, which undermines public trust and complicates the work of professional journalists.” While the association seeks to advocate for high ethical standards, and foster trust between the media and its audiences, MATT cited an “urgent need to strengthen protections for journalists, ensure transparency in governance, and support open dialogue between media practitioners, policymakers, and the public.”\"}\n"

      "Social card title: Can explainable AI classify shrike (Laniidae) eggs by uncovering species-wide pigmentation patterns?\n",
      "Social card description: The complex patterns on bird eggs, characterized by their replicability, distinctiveness, and intricacy, play significant roles in avian biology, including camouflage, protection from brood parasites, protecting embryos, nest identification, strengthening eggshells, and female sexual selection. The genus Lanius, known for its distinctive pigmentation patterns, shows considerable variability within species, making it an intriguing but poorly understood group. We applied Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. To do this, we used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify shrike eggs and explore potential correlations between egg identification and eggshell patterns. Our CNN model achieved over 95% accuracy in predicting species, but identifying specific discriminative features proved difficult, as the model only highlighted general trends. This method could help organize collections and verify species affiliation in global ornithological collections, which often face challenges such as missing or illegible labels. CNNs can enhance species identification and improve the accuracy of ornithological studies. Despite some challenges, the potential applications of this research in avian biology and museum collections are promising. It offers new insights into the role of eggshell patterns in avian evolutionary strategies. This approach not only enriches our understanding of egg pigmentation but also contributes to advancements in studies spanning from ecology to biomedical research.\n",

      "Social card description: The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities. Therefore, the AI research community needs to stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research.\n",

Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings.\\nOn that note, here were a few of our favorites this week.\\n- Mark Zuckberg Explains Meta’s AI Strategy. Meta announced this week that it’s increasing projected capital expenditures for 2025 to between $64-72 billion, an upward adjustment that “reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts.” So what do those efforts look like, and how does AI accrue to the bottom line? Ben’s interview with Mark Zuckerberg provides answers on several fronts, as Zuckerberg lists four categories of Meta’s future in which AI will be critical, and explains why the company is launching a standalone app to compete with Chat GPT. It all makes for a fun conversation that’s dense with information, and as a bonus, this interview reminded me that last fall Ben wrote that Meta is better positioned than anyone to capitalize on AI, and may ultimately become the most valuable company in the world. A good, spicy take for the weekend. — Andrew Sharp\\n- Apple’s Big Loss. The biggest news of the week didn’t happen in an earnings call or keynote stage, but in a court room: the judge in the long-running Apple v. Epic case ruled that Apple had violated her order to allow apps to link out the web, and asked federal investigators to investigate the company for contempt of court. More importantly — at least for everyone else in the industry — is the fact that Apple must immediately allow apps to link out to the web for purchases in any way they deem fit. I will be writing more on this case soon, but published a special Friday Update to point out that Apple might still win on appeal: they may be acting badly, but it’s not clear the judge can simply force the App Store open without compensation. — Ben Thompson\\n- The Other Side of the Trade War. One thing that has bugged me as a media consumer is that U.S. coverage of the trade war has been dominated by dire predictions and anxiety over what tariffs on China could mean for the U.S., but there hasn’t been much attention paid to the enormous short and medium term risks facing China. In short: The trade war puts tremendous stress on China’s economy today, and as excess manufacturing output is diverted to third party countries, those dynamics may also inflame China’s relationships with the rest of the world. Bill and I discussed all those risks, as well as increasingly precarious futures for Apple and Nvidia, on this week’s episode of Sharp China. — AS\\nStratechery Articles and Updates\\n- Google Earnings, Search and AI, Building AI Products — Google’s earnings were well-received, but they made me a bit nervous; Google is focusing all their energy on the race between Search + AI and AI > Search.\\n- Intel Earnings, TSMC Earnings — Intel’s earnings were brutal; TSMC, in stark contrast, is absolutely killing it.\\n- Amazon, Trump, and Tariff Costs; Amazon Haul and Temu; Political Lessons — Amazon’s collision with the White House over tariffs highlights the political risk factors that every company needs to take seriously.\\n- An Interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg About AI and the Evolution of Social Media — An interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about Llama and the AI opportunity, the evolution of social medial, and what it means to connect.\\n- Apple Held in Contempt, The Crux of the Case, The Takings Clause — The judge in the Epic case released a devastating ruling on Apple’s lack of compliance in terms of allowing links to the win; Apple was clearly in the wrong, but still might win on appeal.\\nDithering with Ben Thompson and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber\\nAsianometry with Jon Yu\\nSharp China with Andrew Sharp and Sinocism’s Bill Bishop\\nGreatest of All Talk with Andrew Sharp and WaPo’s Ben Golliver\\n- LeBron and the Lakers on the Brink, Nikola Jokic Listens to GOAT, The Pistons Get Robbed in Broad Daylight\\n- The Wolves and the Red Wedding, The Lakers and an Uncertain Future, Takes and Questions at the End of Round 1\\nSharp Tech with Andrew Sharp and Ben Thompson\\n- All About AI Companions: Personalization Upsides, Dystopian Downsides, AI Therapy, Advertising Tension, and Lots More\\n- Meta and Its Many Plans in AI, Apple Gets Hammered in Court, The Costs of Waiting to Do the Right Thing\\nThis week’s Sharp Tech video is on how Facebook handled the Snapchat threat.'}\n",

Here are the factors contributing to shortages and what companies can do.\\nFrom powering a chatbot to crunching information in massive data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) is growing everywhere. However, one major problem remains at the center of it all — companies are running out of chips to feed the technology. Several factors are contributing to this shortage, and organizations may be looking at serious bottlenecks in the future.\\nSo, what can supply chain managers do before things become more complicated? It starts with understanding some of the leading circumstances fueling the AI chip shortage.\\n1. Raw Material Shortages\\nAI chips depend on rare and hard-to-source materials, such as gallium, germanium, cobalt, and tungsten, for their semiconductors. These minerals are in short supply, and many come from politically volatile regions or countries with tight control over them. For example, China\\nMining and processing these minerals is not easy either. Environmental regulations, labor conditions, and a lack of domestic refining capacity in many Western countries all contribute to a slower supply chain. That bottleneck keeps fabricators from operating at full capacity, delaying chip production further.\\nStill, these resources have become essential to the production of chips, and demand will only keep growing. According to market projections, the global semiconductor materials market may grow\\n2. Increased Demand for AI Computing Power\\nSince the 2022 breakthrough in generative AI, every company wanted in on the action. From scrappy startups to cloud titans, diverse companies vied to build the next big thing in artificial intelligence. With tools like ChatGPT gaining popularity, the demand for AI computing power has exploded. Suddenly, every application needed machine learning. Explosions like this have consequences, especially for the chips doing all the heavy lifting.\\nAI models — especially the massive large language models — require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. These components are expensive to make and even harder to scale. As model sizes expand into the billions of parameters, so does the appetite for computing power. This increases the need for serious infrastructure.\\nMajor players like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have already boosted their capital spending\\nThat’s where the center of the shortage lies. The supply chain can't handle this kind of spike. With AI now baked into everything, lead times are growing, and production backlogs are piling up. Yet, with the global AI chip market\\n3. Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Restrictions\\nSemiconductors are more than tech components — they’re geopolitical currency. The U.S.-China trade war has turned chipmaking into a chess game, and AI chips are now one of the most contested pieces.\\nTo curb China’s access to advanced technologies, the U.S.\\nYet, it’s more than about individual companies. The entire semiconductor ecosystem is wildly globalized. A single AI chip might involve design in California, fabrication in Taiwan, materials from Japan, and assembly in Malaysia. When governments throw up barriers, the ripple effects can paralyze entire supply chains.\\n4. AI-Driven Demand from PCs and Smartphones\\nAI is now reaching into consumers’ pockets. Until recently, most of the heavy AI lifting happened in the cloud. However, chipmakers are now bringing AI capabilities into smart devices, creating an even higher demand for AI chips.\\nFor example, smartphones are quickly evolving into mini AI machines. Their capabilities range from real-time language translation to generative image editing — features that require powerful on-device processing. Fitting energy-efficient chips into already thermally constrained devices can be a tough engineering challenge and an even tougher supply chain issue.\\nHowever, AI smartphone shipments are growing exponentially, with market forecasts predicting them to grow\\nStrategic Responses to Mitigating Shortages\\nSupply chain managers can take steps to reduce the potentially negative impacts of AI chip shortages. Here’s how they may play smarter in a chip-starved market:\\n- Diversifying suppliers: Relying on a single vendor can create setbacks. That’s why spreading sourcing across multiple regions and vendors is important.\\n- Strengthening supplier relationships: Businesses must treat suppliers like strategic partners rather than vending machines. From collaborative planning to long-term contracts, various tactics can give companies a leg up when things are tight.\\n- Investing in inventory buffering: Stocking inventory based on usage data and realistic forecasting can buy time without draining cash flow.\\n- Enhancing demand forecasting with AI: Ironically, AI can solve the chip shortage. With predictive analytics, organizational leaders can anticipate surges, identify vulnerabilities, and plan accordingly.\\n- Exploring domestic or nearshore manufacturing: Shorter supply chains can support smoother operations. If reshoring isn’t an option, nearshoring can offer a solid middle ground for critical components.\\nSolving the AI Chip Shortage\\nAI may be booming, but there are not enough chips to keep pace with demand. With each issue occurring simultaneously, they pull the semiconductor supply chain in every direction. For supply chain managers and tech leaders to stay ahead, there will be a growing matter of planning smarter and building strength before it begins.\"}\n",
      "async_langchain: 3, {'article': 'Page title: A Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\nSocial card title: A Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\nSocial card description: A practical guide on building effective AI agents by Anthropic\\xa0AI, and what steps the agent-building process actually involves.\\nA Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\n- Nishant\\n- 1 day ago\\n- 5 min read\\nThe real buzz around artificial intelligence in business right now centers on something more practical yet potentially just as significant: AI agents. AI agents are quietly yet noticeably changing how companies tackle complex tasks; these aren\\'t just chatbots answering simple questions anymore. We\\'re talking about AI systems designed to perform multi-step tasks, use software tools, and even autonomously make decisions along the way; these AI agents can parse customer inquiries, code, and orchestrate workflows across teams.\\nCompanies are actively building these \"agentic systems\" to tackle complex problems because AI agents think on their feet just like humans: deciding which tool to use, planning their steps, and pausing for feedback when they hit an obstacle. For business leaders, this means offloading repetitive or multi-stage processes to a system that adapts as it goes, freeing up human talent for higher-value work and keeping projects moving even when requirements change.\\nBut before you think it is all easy set and done, insights from AI labs like Anthropic suggest a well-needed and important reality check. The most successful teams aren\\'t diving headfirst into complexity; they\\'re starting simple and building smart. Let\\'s cut through the noise, take a look at this practical guide on building effective AI agents by Anthropic AI, and what steps the agent-building process actually involves.\\nSo, What Exactly Are AI Agents?\\nThe term \"agent\" gets thrown around a lot. Sometimes, it refers to fully autonomous systems working independently for long stretches, and other times, it describes systems guided along very specific, pre-set paths. Anthropic helpfully groups these under the banner of \"agentic systems,\" but draws a useful line between the two main approaches:\\nWorkflows: Think of these like a flowchart. The large language model (LLM) and different software tools are directed through predefined steps coded by developers, making them predictable and controlled.\\nAgents: Here, the LLM is more in the driver\\'s seat. It dynamically figures out the process, decides which tools to use, and steers itself towards completing the task. This offers more flexibility.\\nUnderstanding this distinction is key because it affects how you build, manage, and trust these systems.\\nWhen Does Building an Agent Make Sense (and When Doesn\\'t It)?\\nBefore jumping into complex agent builds, the first question should always be: Is this necessary? Agentic systems often mean slower response times and higher operational costs compared to simpler AI calls. That trade-off only makes sense if you significantly improve handling the task\\'s complexity. Often, simply improving a single interaction with an LLM, perhaps by giving it access to relevant documents (retrieval) or providing good examples, is enough.\\nIf more steps are genuinely required, structured workflows are usually better for tasks you can clearly map out. Truly dynamic agents are best reserved for situations needing adaptability and model-driven choices at scale, where the exact path to a solution isn\\'t known beforehand. The guiding principle? Start with the simplest approach that works and only add layers when the benefit clearly outweighs the added complexity and cost.\\nBuilding Blocks: How These Systems Actually Work\\nThe real driving force behind any agentic system is an LLM that\\'s been improved by giving access to information retrieval systems, software tools (like calculators, calendars, or databases), and some form of memory. The real work lies in designing how these components interact. Based on observations from teams building these systems, several common structures, primarily within the more predictable \"workflow\" category, have come up:\\nPrompt Chaining: Breaking a task into a sequence of smaller LLM tasks, where the output of one step feeds into the next. Good for accuracy on complex, decomposable jobs (e.g., draft an email, then translate it).\\nRouting: Using an initial LLM step to classify an input and send it down the right path, potentially to different specialized prompts or even different AI models. Useful for handling varied requests efficiently (e.g., sending sales leads one way, support tickets another).\\nParallelization: Having the LLM work simultaneously on different parts of a task involves splitting the task into independent sections (Sectioning) or running the same task multiple times for more powerful results (Voting). Think of it like having one AI check content for facts while the other checks for tone.\\nOrchestrator-Workers: A central LLM acts like a manager, breaking down a complex task it doesn\\'t know how to solve upfront, assigning sub-tasks to \\'worker\\' LLMs, and then combining the results. This orchestration suits tasks where the required steps appear as you go, like complex coding modifications.\\nEvaluator-Optimizer: One LLM generates a response, and another LLM critiques it based on set criteria, leading to iterative refinement. This type of optimization mimics a human writing and editing process and is useful for tasks requiring nuance, like high-quality translation.\\nThe Role of Frameworks\\nTools like LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock\\'s agent framework, Rivet, and Vellum make building these multi-step systems easier by handling some of the basic plumbing. However, they can also add layers of abstraction that make it harder to see what the AI is exactly doing or why it made a particular choice, which complicates troubleshooting.\\nAnthropic advice developers should consider starting by interacting directly with the LLM\\'s programming interface (API), as many effective patterns don\\'t require complex frameworks. If you do use one, make sure you understand what\\'s happening under the hood.\\nPutting agents to work\\nFor many teams, the first step is figuring out whether an agent is really necessary. If a single, well-structured prompt with a bit of retrieval meets your needs, stick with that. But when tasks spin-off in unpredictable directions—think launching marketing campaigns across markets, triaging thousands of support tickets, or orchestrating multi-system data analyses—agents can step in and keep the ball rolling.\\nIn practice, successful deployments often follow a simple path:\\nDefine the goal: What decision or task do you want to automate?\\nIdentify tools: Which services, databases, or code hooks should the agent use?\\nBuild a minimal prototype: Wire up the core LLM with basic tool calls and a fallback plan if something fails.\\nTest in a sandbox: Watch how the agent plans, run steps, and handles unexpected results.\\nAdd guardrails: Set limits on cost, iteration count, or tool usage to prevent runaway loops.\\nIterate and refine: Use logs and evaluations—either human or model-driven—to pinpoint weak spots and improve prompts, tool docs, or workflow logic.\\nThe real value of an AI agent isn\\'t how many fancy components you stitch together—it\\'s how reliably it completes the job you need, with clear transparency into each decision. Start simple, prove the concept, and only layer in more sophistication when the use case demands it. That way, you\\'ll avoid overbuilding and keep both your team and your budget on track.\\nTrue Agents: Potential and Precautions\\nSystems where the LLM dynamically directs its own path (the \"agent\" definition) are becoming more viable as models improve at reasoning and using tools. They can tackle open-ended problems where the steps aren\\'t predictable.\\nHowever, this autonomy comes with risks. Errors can compound, and costs can increase. Thorough testing in safe environments and implementing clear boundaries (guardrails) are absolutely necessary before letting such agents operate on important tasks.\\nConclusion: Build Smart, Not Just Complex\\nThe journey into AI agents for businesses shouldn\\'t be a race to build the most intricate system possible. Success lies in finding the right system for the specific need. AI agents offer a fresh way to solve tasks that are too interactive for static workflows yet demand more oversight than a single prompt can provide. Start with well-crafted prompts for single AI interactions. If that\\'s not enough, try structured workflows. Only enter into fully dynamic agents when the task truly demands that level of flexibility, and you\\'ve carefully considered the costs and risks.\\nBy focusing on clear goals, simple building blocks, and careful testing, business professionals can introduce agents that adapt to real-world needs, boosting efficiency while keeping every step visible and under control. Keep the design as simple as possible for the job, ensure you can understand how it\\'s making decisions, and pay close attention to how the agent interacts with its tools and information sources. Building effective AI agents is less about flashy technology and more about thoughtful, practical engineering.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 5, {'article': \"Page title: AI Is Amping Up Phishing, Smishing And Vishing Attacks\\nSocial card title: AI Is Amping Up Phishing, Smishing And Vishing Attacks\\nSocial card description: Once synonymous with poor grammar and misspelled words, phishing messages are now more professional and personalized.\\nMichelle Drolet is CEO of Towerwall, a pure-play cybersecurity firm offering compliance and professional cybersecurity services.\\nArtificial intelligence has certainly emerged as a game-changer in cybersecurity—in both good and bad ways. On one hand, it has strengthened cybersecurity by fast-tracking threat detection and response, but on the other, it has intensified the speed and efficacy of cyber threats, making them riskier for businesses.\\nAI gives new teeth to age-old cyber threats like phishing, smishing and vishing. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, such attacks have risen by a staggering 1,265%. Once synonymous with poor grammar and misspelled words, phishing messages are now more professional and personalized, seemingly sent by trusted sources and domains.\\nLet’s explore how AI has elevated the accuracy and impact of phishing, smishing and vishing attacks.\\nPhishing: Increased Success Rate With AI-Led Personalization\\nPhishing involves threat actors who use deceptive language and methods to gain the victim’s confidence and extract sensitive information such as credit card details, passwords or other personal data. They pretend to be trustworthy entities such as banks, reputed brands or government agencies. Fueled by AI, these threat actors analyze victims’ public profiles, social media accounts and breached data stores to create highly personalized and contextually relevant phishing emails, resulting in smarter, more coercive attacks.\\nAI-led phishing attacks use the following techniques:\\n• AI-generated algorithms mimic writing styles to generate emails supposedly being sent by a person or domain the victim trusts.\\n• Sentiment analysis exploits victims’ emotional vulnerabilities. For example, emails that use scare tactics or offer aid to someone in distress.\\n• Natural language processing (NLP) ensures emails are grammatically accurate.\\nSmishing: AI And The Rise Of SMS-Based Phishing\\nSmishing (SMS phishing) is a cyberattack where attackers use text messages supposedly sent by trusted entities like banks, government agencies and delivery services to lure victims into revealing sensitive information. Such messages contain malicious links or instructions to take immediate action.\\nIn 2024, smishing comprised 39% of mobile threats. It’s a preferred tool for threat actors due to the high usage of mobile devices and user trust in SMS communications. While the average click rate of smishing is 20%, that of email phishing is a mere 3% to 5%. Although only 35% of users know what smishing is, text messages are saved from the extensive screening that standard emails go through.\\nAI has made smishing more compelling by adding automation, scale and personalization to fraudulent text messages that appear legitimate. For instance, AI tools can:\\n• Increase the scale of attacks by sending a large volume of automated messages customized for different victims.\\n• Use behavior predictive analysis to send smishing messages to victims based on their typical phone usage patterns, increasing their chances of engagement.\\n• Create convincing message content that mimics the tone and language of trusted entities.\\n• Launch hybrid, multi-stage attacks that combine AI-generated audio messages with fraudulent SMS to convince victims, increasing the likelihood of success.\\nVishing: AI-Amplified Voice Phishing\\nVishing is a type of phishing attack that uses phone calls, voicemails and voice messages to trick users into revealing sensitive personal or corporate information. Using techniques like AI-powered voice synthesis and deepfakes, attackers impersonate trusted entities like a company's IT helpdesk to manipulate victims.\\nVishing attacks rose steeply by 442% between H1 2024 and H2 2024 as threat actors employed helpdesk social engineering and callback phishing methods to target victims.\\nHow AI is enhancing vishing attacks:\\n• Cloning the voice of a trusted contact with uncanny accuracy to create a deepfake audio. For example, an employee on the finance team receives a voice message from the CFO instructing an instant bank transfer.\\n• Using NLP, AI chatbots simulate convincing human-like interactions on phone calls. For example, they can respond dynamically to victims’ queries to make the conversation appear genuine or adjust their scripts based on the victims’ sentiment analysis.\\n• Helping threat actors target victims in different regions with highly localized and convincing phone calls using AI’s ability to mimic voices in multiple languages and accents.\\n• Increasing the reach of vishing campaigns using AI-led autodialers that can generate a large volume of calls.\\nHow Organizations Can Mitigate AI Phishing Attacks\\n• Train employees on security awareness. Periodic simulated phishing campaigns can help employees recognize and respond to phishing attempts effectively and stay informed about evolving threat tactics.\\n• Enforce zero trust. Organizations can limit the damage from a successful phishing attack by implementing the principle of least privilege. Users and systems are given the minimum access required to perform their tasks, thereby restricting access to sensitive information and systems in case of a breach.\\n• Deploy AI-based security. Organizations can defend against AI-led threats with AI-led cybersecurity tools that can scan vast amounts of data to detect network and user anomalies, respond to threats autonomously, identify weaknesses in security policies and controls and more.\\n• Install multifactor authentication. By requiring users to verify their identities through multiple factors, such as authenticator apps or one-time passcodes, MFA adds an extra layer of protection, specifically when a phishing attack has compromised credentials.\\n• Leverage shared threat intelligence. Collaboration with threat labs and global cybersecurity networks can help organizations stay informed about new phishing techniques and help them adapt their defenses to new threats.\\nIntegrating AI with phishing, smishing and vishing has increased the sophistication and precision of such attacks. AI algorithms, sentiment analysis and NLP enable threat actors to scan vast data sets, personalize attacks and deceive victims with increased speed, surface and scalability. Organizations need AI-driven cybersecurity tools, security training and awareness among employees and collaboration between cybersecurity experts and businesses to combat such AI-powered social engineering attacks.\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

In the last couple of years, however, it has moved from the realm of science fiction into reality, with millions of people using tools like ChatGPT every day.\\nAs AI continues to evolve and grow, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it will be able to replace many people’s jobs (and it already has in some cases). Initially, the standard assumption was that it would just replace jobs that were entry level and repetitive, but that is quickly changing and it has some people worried.\\nKlarna is a rapidly growing FinTech company worth around $14 billion. One thing that sets it apart is that it has fully bought into using AI to streamline their services. In a press release put out earlier this year, the company said that they believe that their ChatGPT integration was going to replace about 700 full-time agents.\\nThis isn’t just talk either. The company says they have all but stopped hiring for many positions, allowing AI to fill in the gaps when people leave the company.\\nCEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has been thrilled with the increases in capacity and efficiency, and of course, the reductions in expenses, that they have been able to take advantage of thanks to AI. According to a series of posts on X, however, he is now also growing worried that AI will be able to replace him as well.\\n“To me AI is capable of doing all our jobs, my own included. Because our work is simply reasoning combined with knowledge/experience. And the most critical breakthrough, reasoning, is behind us.”\\nWhile the entry level workers who have already been replaced by AI are likely laughing at the irony here, it is a serious concern. As more and more jobs are able to be done by AI, it will change the way the entire economy works.\\nThis goes well beyond just trying to figure out what people will do when they can’t find jobs because everything is being done with AI. For many people, CEOs more than most, their jobs are a major part of their identity. Siemiatkowski continued with his Tweet:\\n“My work to me is a super important part of who I am, and realizing it might become unnecessary is gloomy. But I also believe we need to be honest with what we think will happen. And I [would] rather learn and explore than pretend it does not exist.”\\nThis is the approach most experts are taking to the subject. While there are obviously some major changes to the way jobs are done coming in the future, it is silly to simply ignore AI technology and what it is able to do.\\nCEOs, business owners, technologists, and politicians, however really need to be taking that next step and start thinking about what the world will look like when the vast majority of jobs are simply automated through this incredible technology.\\nWhat jobs can’t be done by AI?\\nIf you enjoyed that story, check out what happened when a guy gave ChatGPT $100 to make as money as possible, and it turned out exactly how you would expect.\\nSign up to get our BEST stories of the week straight to your inbox.'}\n",

Investors will guess how Google, Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta stock price will behave. Conversations will mourn our jobs becoming obsolete and why it does not really matter since we will all be turned into paper-clips in 5 years tops.\\nI will try to put order, risk predictions and coin phrases to help understand the players, their strategy and the future. I will start with two spoilers: “Yes – everything is going to change” and “No – we are not going to die”.\\nWhat is the current state of AI\\nThe AI that everyone is talking about is basically a huge data, statistics and calculation machine. It appears magical – like all good technologies when they are new – because it is hard for us to intuitively comprehend how it works. The principle is – if you feed a machine with all the word combinations ever created – it will be able to predict any new combination of words. In human terms – if you ask it anything (a combination of words) – it will be able to produce an answer (related combination of words). And here comes the “magic” – it produces the answer not because it “understands” the question – rather because it is statistically likely this combination of words is correct from the huge collection of words it is fed with.\\nDo the same with enough images, videos and sounds – and you get – given enough calculation power – the ability to create videos, images, sounds. And voilà – Generative AI.\\nHow is AI going to feel like\\nIn a year or two – AI is going to feel like speaking to a real person. Current problems will be dramatically reduced. It will stop “hallucinating” (confidently providing wrong answers), it will be cheap, it will be fast, it will be smooth. It will know a great deal of things such as medicine, math, history, philosophy, biology, physics, literature. Producing text, code, analysis, images, video and even reliably imitating “emotions”. Since using it will be like talking to an all-knowing, capable and helpful person, it will not be the domain of early adopters but everyone. Not using it will be like not using Google today. It will also affect many jobs – with painful consequences if it happens too fast – or not so dramatic if a bit slower. I will not go into predicting the detailed effect on medical doctors, lawyers, accountants, dietitians, insurance agents, support and sales reps. Let’s just say our kids will think of them like we think of scribes.\\nMany new things are going to emerge and “ride” the AI. Adding “spirit” to the machine. You can imagine adding an “all knowing” entity (but not intelligent – on that later) to your car? Phone? Glasses? Headphones? Tracktor? Fridge? What are you going to feel comfortable talking to it about? My guess is everything.\\nBut there are three distinctions we need to make about AI capabilities and limitations before calling Sarah Connor and building an EMP gun. Objective AI, Subjective AI and real AGI.\\nThe rise of Objective AI\\nObjective AI is (and will be much better at) giving us answers towards knowledge that is easily accessible. Anything that is somewhere on the internet or can be scanned and poured in. Knowledge, not just data, since it will be able to distill and refine according to your needs. This is the major difference between Objective AI and current search. Let’s think of a few examples –\\n“I have this pain in my leg, right here [showing image] above the knee. But only in the morning and only when I sit. I’m 53 and I swim regularly and never had anything like this before. Can we have a short discussion to diagnose it?”\\n“I recently moved to Spain and need some advice with my taxation, can you guide me through it?”\\n“I want to learn Japanese while commuting to work. I’m fluent in Hungarian. Can we have regular conversations, with emphasis on student life, and please correct my errors and pronunciation as we converse so I can learn from them”.\\n“Let’s have a discussion about virus-to-cell hydrophobic protein communication. Assume I am a postdoc in microbiology and please let’s do it in Dutch in which I am more comfortable”.\\n“I feel a bit off today. Can we have a chat in which I will tell you what’s troubling me and see if you can bring my spirits up?”\\nYou get the idea. Anything that is “somewhere” on the internet or to which the companies building the AI have access to – will be available in forms which are easy for us to consume. What Objective AI cannot help with? Everything it does not have access to. Which is a lot.\\nFollowed by Subjective AI\\nSubjective AI is more challenging as it requires adding to the Objective knowledge ability to access data that is not readily available. For example – what you eat and drink. Who you meet with. How you spend your time. Your financial information. What you bought at the supermarket. Your detailed medical history. And also everything that has been digitized but is behind a password. Let’s see a few examples where Subjective AI can be useful –\\n“Can you tell me how much I spent on toys for my kids this year and how much time they spent playing with each one?”\\n“Can you tell me if I’m on track to losing weight? Am I burning more calories than I consume? If so – how long is it going to take for me to reach my ideal weight and if not – can you keep guard and let me know in real time?”\\n“Can you call the electricity company to check why our last bill was so high, negotiate a better price and if not possible – see if you can find a competitor that will save us money per our usage profile, schedule the transfer and follow up on its completion?”\\n“Can you book a pottery class for me and my sister, in a studio or even with an artist that will take us as private students. It needs to be close to where we live, fit with our schedules and match our preferred style”.\\nThese “Intelligent” conversations require access to two things –\\n- Data that is not currently collected. You need glasses that see what you eat and drink, what you spend time on and cameras that record everything your kids do.\\n- Data that is often available digitally but is behind a password. Your calendar, your Amazon purchase details, your electricity bill, your Instagram account.\\nOpenAI, Google, Apple, Meta. The Companion providers race\\nRI (Really Intelligent) as you are – patterns start emerging. OpenAI, Anthropic and other newcomers are building Objective AI. So do Google, Meta, X (Twitter), Apple. The hiccups they currently have will be solved. Errors reduced (Remember VHS? You will remember search before Larry Page invented PageRank). Prices will be lowered, interfaces smoothed, collaborations signed until everyone will have an all-knowing companion to discuss everything. Everything which is not private.\\nGoogle – will have one tiny edge over others. With your permission of course – it can access and help itself to more data. It can read your emails and documents, see your photos, know what you browse and where you are, what you buy, save your passwords and run the apps on your phone. It happens to have access to a lot of “private” data and will be happy to give more Subjective help.\\nTo not be left behind – OpenAI can ask to use your passwords. Perhaps also building a browser and convincing Microsoft to get back to its phone-building plans. Maybe jump directly to smart glasses and simply scrap data based on everything that you do?\\nApple will tell you all this is a privacy nightmare. It will provide Objective and Subjective AI right on the phone – without going to the cloud like OpenAI and Google do. It will take Apple longer (since it is hard to get the compute power required for the same level of “intelligence” to run on the phone compared to a server farm sapping the world’s energy) but when they feel confident enough – they will tell all app builders they are now obliged to open their data locally to the on-phone intelligence – providing the “Subjectivity”. Google will do the same on Android.\\nWhat about others – Meta? Microsoft? Twitter? They have access to subjective data too. Much that we are not even aware exists and is derived from usages and interactions – generating Subjectivity combined with the all-knowing Objective AI.\\nHardware will be built to harness more subjective data. Watches (i.e. medical devices), glasses (combined with audio), cameras and microphones everywhere. AI Companions will be designed with different use cases in mind. The same way we do not interact with the same person for all our human needs – we will interact with different Companions for different wants.\\nTuring Test and the air of AGI\\nIn 1950 Alan Turing published a paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” in which he proposed a test – if a human interacts with both a machine and a human and cannot tell which is which – the machine can be deemed “intelligent”. Since then many attempts were made to achieve this but none was successful (unless employing silly tricks). It has been considered the “holy grail” of AI – a level once reached will mark the “singularity point” from which machines will start thinking independently, solve cancer, wars, poverty, aging, galactic transportation and within a few months of self-improving, enslave and then get rid of us, inferior humans.\\nMy guess – AI will pass the Turing Test with flying colors in a year or so.\\nOur subsequent immediate demise – not so much.\\nCurrent AI will be incredibly knowledgeable. It will know everything humanity knows and will sound (and look) like a person. But for the same reason a knowledgeable person is not necessarily an intelligent one – so will it. AI will not have motivations, non-linear creativity, feelings, curiosity, awareness. There will be a great deal of philosophical debate about what is “intelligent” and we will be fooled by the all knowing, human seeming machines. We will feel compelled to speak with politeness and not hurt its feelings, but it will not hold a grudge. There will not be an “emergent” moment in which the machines will start improving themselves and then start conspiring against us. They will not “care”. They will not “anything”. They will be there only to answer and do the intellectual “lifting” for us.\\nWhat we did until now is “solve” language (and sound, and visual) but we do not have an “internet” source of motivation, feelings and creativity to teach a machine from. We have only the output – not the drives. These drives – which are at the core of sentient beings’ intelligence – are still out of our reach. We are still debating how to define them. Are they even “ours” (Anthropocentrism at its glory) or emerging from an ecosystem of creatures and surrounding effects operating in concert? Perhaps in the future we will be able to better understand and create a code that will “solve” this too. Then real AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and super-intelligence might emerge.\\nStill worried AI will eat your lunch? No need. Unless…\\nSounds dystopian? It is not. The coming AI is only another leap in efficiency.\\nWhen the printing press was invented and books were made available – regulators were terrified “reactionary ideas” will spread, breaking the social order. When trains were invented – people thought the human body traveling at speeds greater then 30 mph will break (Excusable fear. Einstein was only born 70 years later. There was no one to ask about relative speed). Calculators? Will soften kids brains. The internet? Don’t even start. Everyone will become jobless ignorants.\\nThings we used to spend hours, days, months and even years in order to achieve became orders of magnitude faster thanks to technology. Sure there will be “bumps” on the way (errors, privacy, fraud, addiction) and major economic shifts (whole professions will be gone) but overall – we will gain time, safety, health and wealth.\\nNew jobs will be created and our life as a whole will be better in the long term. Not many people thought of becoming a scribe, a carriage driver or a manual loom operator in 1990. But also no one thought of becoming a Digital Marketing Manager. Not all professions will survive. If an all-knowing machine can answer better in a specific field – I would not try to study hard and compete on the ground of knowledge. “No new intelligence” also means we are still going to be very dumb as a species. A “quality” that led us to very dark places in the past.\\nThe newly created free time can mean more creativity, more problems solved, more time spent with loved ones, in nature, doing sports. More caring for others. I’m optimistic.'}\n",

The company is leaning into agentic AI with a series of products that help businesses streamline their software pipelines while maintaining its presence in API management.\\nThis evolution is not only about keeping pace with competitors — it’s about future-proofing operations. Boomi is positioning itself as the connective layer between legacy systems and emerging AI workflows, aiming to remove the friction from enterprise modernization. The company’s AI-centric approach is designed to help enterprises integrate faster, reduce cost, and accelerate time to insight.\\nWith the annual Boomi World event kicking off May 12, Boomi’s market strategy is under a spotlight, as experts and analysts look for what to expect from the integration platform.\\n“Boomi’s infusion of AI into its iPaaS offerings reflects a broader industry shift toward intelligent automation,” said Paul Nashawaty, analyst for theCUBE. “Industry data is projecting that by 2026, 80% of integration work will be handled by AI-enabled tools, up from just 20% in 2023. Boomi is aligning with this trend by using AI to streamline tasks like data mapping, error resolution, and API generation.”\\nThis feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s exploration of how the enterprise is leveraging intelligent automation and agentic AI to modernize integration and API management. Be sure to watch theCUBE’s analyst-led coverage of Boomi World from May 14-15. (* Disclosure below.)\\nBoomi is embracing intelligent automation\\nLast year, Boomi announced its chatbot, Boomi GPT, as a part of its suite of iPaaS services. Since then, the company has continued to roll out AI products such as Boomi Agentstudio, with an emphasis on agentic AI and intelligent automation.\\nThe AI-powered upgrades to Boomi’s platform reflect an industry shift toward agents and more sophisticated data management. Businesses that previously managed with siloed data are struggling to integrate their system for large language models.\\nThis challenge is especially critical as generative AI becomes more embedded into everyday business workflows. Without strong integration and orchestration layers, organizations risk falling behind as AI-driven decision-making becomes the new norm.\\n“Unless you’re writing limericks about cats, you’re going to want to ground these AI models with your data, your context,” Matt McLarty, chief technology officer of Boomi, told theCUBE at Boomi World 2024. “This idea of gen AI orchestration is going to become more prominent, but it’s going to become pretty obvious that a platform like ours … is a building block, a foundational element for what you need to do.”\\nThe early access launch of Boomi’s Agentstudio revealed a range of tools for designing and governing AI agents, a unified “Agent Garden” space for interacting with agents using natural language and an “Agent Marketplace” for accessing off-the-shelf and customizable AI agents from Boomi and its partners. The goal is for users to have a more secure and efficient path toward API and platform management.\\nThis modular, agent-based architecture aligns with broader industry momentum toward platform extensibility. Boomi’s bet is that organizations will want to train and deploy their own domain-specific agents while also being able to browse and plug in pre-built capabilities from trusted partners.\\n“This move mirrors a larger market push to reduce integration complexity and scale digital transformation,” Nashawaty said. “In addition, research estimates global AI spending will reach $500 billion by 2027, with integration being a key enabler of enterprise AI adoption.”\\nCementing a position in the API management market\\nA critical factor in the success of AI adoption is API management. Since integration is Boomi’s bread and butter, connecting businesses’ APIs with an eye toward AI pipelines has been a logical step for the iPaaS company.\\n“You’ve got to have good governance,” John Furrier, analyst for theCUBE, explained. “They’re nailing that with the data management and the agent framework tied in there … The API management is critical, because 80% of all traffic is run through APIs. It might even be more than that, but that’s basically the internet.”\\nWith Boomi API Management, Boomi provides a more unified platform to manage APIs. The solution tackles API sprawl by offering better governance and security than traditional platforms, with the aim of optimizing performance of API products.\\nThe rise of microservices and hybrid cloud deployments has only increased the need for reliable API oversight. Boomi’s Control Plane aims to provide enterprises with the visibility and control needed to manage complex API ecosystems, regardless of the vendor or underlying infrastructure.\\n“Boomi is playing a pivotal role in modern API management by combining low-code integration, full API lifecycle capabilities, and built-in governance, enabling both developers and business users to rapidly connect and manage applications,” Nashawaty said.\\nThe Boomi API Control Plane expands on Boomi API management by supporting a wider range of API gateways from other vendors. This product merges the software assets Boomi acquired from APIIDA GmbH and Cloud Software Group Inc. last year, reflecting the company’s move to strengthen its partner ecosystem.\\nBy broadening its compatibility, Boomi isn’t just selling a product — it’s trying to build a platform ecosystem. This approach allows enterprises to use Boomi’s orchestration and observability tools across multi-vendor environments, making the transition to AI-ready infrastructure more feasible.\\nBoomi’s growing presence in the enterprise world\\nBoomi has made multiple acquisitions focused on improving its integration platform in the last year, including APIIDA and Cloud Software Group. Most recently, Boomi acquired Rivery, a data integration provider that offers Change Data Capture (CDC). This will enhance Boomi’s platform by facilitating the integration of data across silos and the creation of more efficient data pipelines.\\n“[Boomi] has been around the block in iPaaS application integration, which, by the way, is never going away, but they had that relationship with Dell, they spun back out,” Furrier said. “This company is really poised … for potentially becoming the next ServiceNow-like company, where their presence in the enterprise is pretty significant.”\\nThe Dell spinout gave Boomi the flexibility to accelerate innovation and pursue aggressive growth. Freed from the confines of a large parent company, Boomi has shifted toward a more agile development cycle, pushing AI updates and new capabilities to market faster than many of its legacy competitors.\\nThat is certainly Boomi’s goal, and the company has made known its strategy to be the fertile soil—Boomi means “earth”—for enterprise business. Since the current market is experiencing a lot of upheaval, Boomi’s expanding network of partnerships and focus on intelligent automation could be key for the company’s success.\\n“It’s a really unique position to be in, 20,000 customers, 800 partners,” said Savannah Peterson, host of theCUBE, in a conversation with Furrier. “Being at the epicenter of the integration game … isn’t always the most thrilling … When you’re in the middle of a huge technological evolution like we’re going into with AI, it’s actually a really prime spot to be.”\\nIf Boomi succeeds in scaling its agentic AI and cross-platform integration vision, it could become a foundational infrastructure provider for the AI-first enterprise era. As digital transformation increasingly revolves around AI-powered orchestration, companies that offer cohesive, end-to-end integration platforms will likely be the ones shaping the enterprise future.\\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for Boomi World.

But they did not fully soothe concerns about upcoming issues at the company, and Apple’s shares fell.\\nApple said that the tariffs could add up to $900 million to its costs in the current quarter, and that most iPhones for the US would no longer be made in China, which has been particularly hard hit by the tariffs.\\nTim Cook, the company’s chief executive, also addressed the widely publicised delay of new AI features, branded as Apple Intelligence, which had been planned for release with the new iPhone but are still yet to arrive.\\nThe Cupertino, California-based company earned $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share, in the first three months of the year, up 4.8% from $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the same period a year earlier.\\nRevenue rose 5.1% to $95.36 billion from $90.75 billion.\\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $94.19 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.\\nThe numbers for the January-March period provide a snapshot of how Apple was faring before President Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs in April that rattled the financial markets amid fears a trade war would reignite inflation and shove the U.S. economy into a recession.\\nApple’s reliance on Chinese factories to make its iPhones and other devices thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trump’s trade war. The exposure caused Apple’s stock price to plunge 23% shortly after the president announced the severity of the reciprocal tariffs, temporarily erasing $773 billion in shareholder wealth in the process.\\nMost of those losses have since been recovered after Trump temporarily exempted iPhones and other electronics from the reciprocal tariffs, but Apple’s stock remains down by nearly 5% since the April fusillade of tariffs.\\nBesides the trade war, Apple has been hurt by its inability to live up to its own hype surrounding artificial intelligence features on the iPhone 16 lineup that came out last fall.\\nThe technology wasn’t ready when the iPhone 16 went on sale. Some AI features have rolled out in parts of the world as part of software updates, but Apple still hasn’t been able to live up to its original promise to make Siri smarter and more versatile. The missteps prompted Apple to pull advertising campaigns promoting AI breakthroughs on the iPhone, although the company still intends to release more features powered by the technology at some point.\\nIn an investor call, Mr Cook acknowledged the delay but said that the new features were still coming.\\n“However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar,” he said. “There’s not a lot of other reason for it.\\n“It’s just taking a bit longer than we thought, but we are making progress and we’re extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.”\\nApple had been counting on its late entry into the AI craze to revive demand for the iPhone after last year’s sales dipped 2% from 2023’s levels. Apple said Wednesday that its phone sales climbed 1.9% to $46.84 billion for the first three months of the year. Wall Street had expected iPhone sales of $45.62 billion.\\nWhen Trump initially indicated his 145% tariffs on Chinese-made goods would apply to the iPhone, U.S. consumers rushed to stores to buy new devices rather than risk prices spiking higher after the duties began driving up costs. But the flurry of panic buying won't show up until Apple reports its results for the April-June quarter this summer.\\nTrump's trade war has ramped up the pressure on Cook to work the same diplomatic sleight of hand that enabled the iPhone to avoid being stung by the China tariffs that the president imposed during his first administration.\\nCook signaled his intention remain on good terms with Trump by arranging private meetings with him and personally donating $1 million to the president's second inauguration ceremony before sitting on the dais when Trump was sworn into office on January 20. Apple subsequently announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. while hiring 20,000 workers during the next four years.\\nTrump's trade war also is prompting a push to Apple to shift all the production of the iPhones that it sells in the U.S. from China to India, where the company has been building up its supply chain for the past seven years, according to a recent story in the Financial Times. But the complicated logistics of making such a huge move likely couldn't be completed until next year, at the earliest, leaving Apple vulnerable to the vagaries of Trump's trade war.\\nApple's stock fell $5.81, or 2.7%, to $207.51 in after-hours trading.\\nAdditional reporting by agencies\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 17, {'article': 'Page title: Bringing AI to the Edge – Communications of the ACM\\nThis year, U.S. rail carrier Amtrak will be installing two novel inspection gateways from Duos Technologies along its busy Northeast Corridor. The barn-like Duos structures straddle railway tracks; as passenger trains speed through at up to 125 miles per hour, 97 cameras and dozens of LED lights arrayed around the sides, top, and bottom of the tracks will capture thousands of high-resolution images of the railcars. These images are aggregated and processed on site in real time to present a complete, 360-degree, highly detailed view of the train. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms running on Nvidia GPUs will analyze the images locally; if the model flags a potential structural or mechanical flaw, train personnel will be notified in less than a minute.\\nThe Duos portal is one of many new examples of what is loosely categorized as edge AI, or the deployment and operation of AI models outside of massive cloud datacenters.\\nThe precise definition of what constitutes an edge varies. “There’s a spectrum, from telecommunications points of presence in major cities to smartwatches, smart home devices, and Meta Ray-Bans,” said Shishir G. Patil, a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “They all come under this pretty broad category of edge devices.”\\nOperating AI models at the edge is challenging for a number of reasons. Typically, there is less computational capacity available, relative to the cloud. The power demands of AI models are much larger than traditional applications, which puts tremendous pressure on local hardware, forcing mobile devices to exhaust their battery power faster. Yet the move to the edge also reduces latency and eliminates the risk of inconsistent or unreliable bandwidth because there is no round trip to distant cloud datacenters. Purpose-built edge AI processors, like the on-device versions from Qualcomm or those from Hailo Inc., allow for real-time intelligent decision making, and there are multiple privacy and security benefits to edge processing. These and other factors have everyone from academic computer scientists to technology giants racing to develop more efficient means of pulling AI out of the cloud and closer to users.\\nThere is computational capacity available all the way from local devices to the cloud, explained distributed AI researcher Lauri Lovén at the University of Oulu in Finland. Exactly where an AI model operates along this edge-cloud continuum depends in part on the use case. An autonomous vehicle that has to make a rapid, real-time traffic decision is better off eliminating the cloud latency and generating that result onboard. Conversely, a consumer photo-editing application powered by AI does not necessarily need to run on the user’s personal device—a latency-induced lag resulting from spotty bandwidth would be perfectly tolerable.\\nRaghubir Singh, an assistant professor of computer science at the U.K.’s University of Bath, suggests the nature of the given problem may determine where, along the continuum, a task is computed. “There will be a tradeoff. Some problems you will be able to solve locally using edge AI, while others will need GPUs with a lot more processing power,” he said. “Think of it like a primary school. You have a classroom teacher who can answer most of your questions, but then maybe there’s one that needs to be solved by someone outside the classroom.” A more complex problem or task could be pushed to a more robust AI model in the cloud for resolution.\\nSingh cites security and privacy as equally important variables. If a patient visits a local health center for a checkup, and machine learning algorithms can process data collected during the exam within that facility, then privacy concerns are minimized. “If that patient data is stored and assessed locally, and not going to the cloud, that sensitive information remains secure,” he explained.\\nEconomics have become increasingly important as well. A personalized AI agent that understands your preferences might be too expensive to operate in the cloud, noted Berkeley’s Patil, because this would require reserving high-end cloud compute capacity just for the individual user, who would have to pay the compute costs to keep the model ready even when it is not in use. On the other hand, the costs of a general AI model maintained in the cloud for mass consumption can be distributed more efficiently across all its users. As a result, Patil and his colleagues are developing techniques to shrink, fine-tune, and personalize models so they can run on consumer hardware like smartphones and other edge devices.\\nThe cost of operating the models in the cloud is also incentivizing AI leaders and cloud giants to push more tasks out to the edge, explained Patil. As advanced AI models grow larger, they consume more electricity and drive up the price of each inference. The most advanced large language models (LLMs) are one obvious example, according to Patil. “LLM inference today is super expensive,” he said. “It’s in the tens of cents per inference, if not higher, especially for the bigger models. Basically, the cloud providers are going to be bleeding money if they give away inferences for free.” But if more AI tools operate on edge devices like smartphones, the cloud provider will assume less of the electricity bill. Instead, the user will pay that cost by charging their phones more often.\\nThe latest smartphones—considered the extreme edge—are now being optimized for edge AI. The recently released Pixel phones incorporate new Google Tensor G4 chips designed specifically for AI workloads. The models running on these phones are also shrinking. When Apple announced its Apple Intelligence features, the company noted that the language model running on the device would have roughly 3 billion parameters, compared to cloud-based models that run to hundreds of billions or even a trillion-plus parameters. Similarly, Meta’s Llama 3.2 release included lightweight models with 1 billion and 3 billion parameters designed to run on devices.\\nThese smaller, purpose-built models are far more suitable to the edge. An advanced generative text-to-video model like OpenAI’s Sora requires significant cloud compute capacity, but simpler AI-enhanced tasks like transforming text to speech could be done with lightweight, efficient models. “You don’t need a Lamborghini to cross the road,” said Patil.\\nElectricity consumption is not just an economics problem, but an environmental one. Suzan Bayhan, an associate professor on the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, points to the sustainability of AI-specific edge devices or edge accelerators—technologies optimized for edge AI processing. “Deploying smarter systems means you want to collect, process, and act on data, and you want this computation to be closer to the user,” she explains. “But if you are running this computation, especially some sort of AI model, on devices that were not actually optimized for these kinds of workloads, they will use a lot of energy.”\\nThe creation of new and more efficient devices could alleviate that problem, she noted, yet this will drive up consumption of raw materials and could lead to a different kind of sustainability problem because of newly outdated, discarded devices. Plus, even though AI models are driving up electricity consumption in datacenters—Goldman Sachs estimates a 160% increase by 2030—the cloud still allows for the potential to control the problem. “When you have cloud or more centralized resources, then you are benefiting from the efficiency of sharing among different parties,” Bayhan explained, “but if we move to devices with edge accelerators, we are limiting this benefit of economies of scale and multi-tenant operation.”\\nNot all applications will move out to that extreme edge, and researchers are working on novel methods of determining where different tasks might be completed or even how to break down and spread out different tasks along the edge-cloud continuum. “We want to create a platform that allows you to distribute applications within this compute continuum and dynamically optimize for, say, latency, computational capacity, money, or resource usage,” said the University of Oulu’s Lovén. “Based on the situation, the platform would rebalance or readjust the distribution of components.”\\nThis decision of where the processing takes place could also be left to individuals, said Bayhan. Her research group is developing methods that would give control to the users, so they can decide where the computation is done based on their own particular needs or preferences. A user could prioritize sustainability, fast performance, or personal security and privacy. “For instance,” Bayhan explained, “if it is my health data, I may not want this computation to be done in the cloud, but closer to my home or on my personal device, for instance, my smartwatch.”\\nAlthough Singh notes there is some hype surrounding edge AI at the moment, he suspects the combination of proliferating smart systems and devices and continued advances in AI will lead to major edge AI contributions and breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years. “There are so many research avenues with edge AI,” said Singh. “It’s such an interesting field, and I hope this work will bring a lot of benefits and advantages and allow more people to utilize edge AI models.”\\nFurther Reading\\n- Meuser, T., Lovén, L., Bhuyan, M., Patil, S., Dustdar, S., Aral, A. et al.\\nRevisiting Edge AI: Opportunities and Challenges, IEEE Internet Computing 28, No. 4 (2024): 49-59. - Singh, R. and Gill, S.S.\\nEdge AI: a survey, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems 3 (2023): 71-92. - Gunter, T., Wang, Z., Wang, C., Pang, R., et al.\\nApple intelligence foundation language models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.21075 (2024). - Zhou, Z., Chen, X., Li, E., Zeng, L., Luo, K., and Zhang, J.\\nEdge intelligence: Paving the last mile of artificial intelligence with edge computing, Proc.

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly significant role in customer engagement, fraud detection, risk assessment, and underwriting. However, the process of integrating AI into insurance ecosystems poses the serious challenge of leveraging sensitive data responsibly while ensuring regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.\\nBalaji Adusupalli, a technology leader and AI-driven innovator, has made a valiant effort to address this problem through his research paper titled “Secure Data Engineering Pipelines for Federated Insurance AI: Balancing Privacy, Speed, And Intelligence.” This research provides a comprehensive framework for building secure data pipelines tailored to\\nSecure Data Engineering in Insurance AI\\nInsurance companies are required to deal with huge volumes of financial, personal, and behavioral data. This data was traditionally aggregated and analyzed using centralized data architectures. These architectures, however, tend to expose insurers to significant regulatory scrutiny and privacy risks.\\nAccording to Adusupalli, there is an urgent need for the insurance sector to transition to federated AI systems. In these systems, models are trained locally on decentralized data and only aggregate insights are shared. This approach enhances compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA while protecting the privacy of individuals.\\nDevelopment of secure data engineering pipelines is central to this transformation proposed by Adusupalli. These are the conduits through which raw data is transformed, encrypted, anonymized, and ultimately utilized for the training and validation of AI models. Each phase of this pipeline has been outlined by Adusupalli's framework, from initial data ingestion to final model deployment.\\nThe Federated Insurance Data Engineering Pipeline\\nThrough his research, Adusupalli has introduced\\n- Anonymization and Encryption Layers: Safeguarding identifiers and numeric values by implementing advanced encryption methods such as semantic encryption and random encryption.\\n- Data Segmentation and Labeling: Separating raw data into labels and features while applying necessary measures for privacy protection.\\n- Access Control Mechanisms: managing data permissions and ensuring traceability using feature-store level tiering and authorization layers\\n- Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC): Ensuring collaborative training of models without data leakage through cryptographic protocols.\\nAll stages of this pipeline have been designed for maximizing data utility without compromising privacy. This allows insurance companies to develop powerful models while adhering to stringent compliance standards.\\nPrivacy-Preserving Techniques\\nAs trust is paramount in this industry, Adusupalli emphasizes that privacy-preserving techniques must be embedded into the data pipeline itself. He recommends protecting sensitive attributes leveraging techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, differential privacy, and k-anonymity. His research explains how unauthorized inference can be prevented and the risk of re-identification can be mitigated by implementing these techniques within federated systems.\\nThe pipeline also includes mechanisms for continuous validation and auditing, which helps maintain reliability and fairness of the model. The architecture aligns with principles of responsible data stewardship and supports ethical AI development by decoupling model training from raw data access.\\nCase Studies in Insurance AI\\nAdusupalli has provided interesting real-world case studies to support his theoretical framework.\\n- Auto Insurance: forecasting claims and optimizing pricing strategies without centralizing personal information by training deep learning models on distributed client data.\\n- Health Insurance: federated learning was used by a consortium-based wellness program to correlate premium incentives with activity data while preserving individual privacy.\\n- Home Insurance: A federated platform was used across multiple insurers for the assessment of risk based on property data while ensuring compliance and locality of data.\\nThese examples demonstrate the scalability and versatility of the pipeline, highlighting its applicability across diverse insurance products and geographies.\\nChallenges to Address\\nDespite its robust foundation, Adusupalli acknowledges that his proposed framework may present several ongoing challenges.\\n- Interoperability: Integration of heterogeneous data systems across brokers, insurers, and third parties can be a complex process.\\n- Scalability: Significant orchestration may be required to support thousands of data sources and models in real-time.\\n- Adversarial Threats: In federated settings, continuous and ongoing research is required to ensure resilience against poisoning attacks and model inversion.\\nAccording to the research, these challenges can be addressed by developing universal data standards and incorporating advanced secure computation techniques.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nBalaji Adusupalli's research provides a technically sound blueprint for the future of AI in the insurance sector. At a time when more and more insurers are turning to AI for competitive advantage, such architectures can play an important part in ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of transparency and trust.\\n“By enabling the collaborative advancement of security-hardened AI from analytics models on private data, tailored for every individual's protection needs, our work will enable historically competing needs to be met,” Adusupalli notes in his research.\"}\n",

However, birds can see beyond the human visual spectrum, perceiving ultraviolet light and experiencing a richer array of colors. It is not only feather color that matters; the complex patterns on bird eggs also play a vital role in their biology. These patterns serve several key functions, such as camouflaging the eggs from predators [1–3], preventing brood parasitism [4–7], and protecting the embryo from solar radiation, water loss, and infections [8,9]. They also help birds locate their nests in colonies [10,11], strengthen the eggshell structure [12], and contribute to play a role in sexual selection by indicating female health and signalling genetic quality [13–15]. According to Stoddard et al. [6], the theory of egg pattern signatures focuses on strategies shaped by host-parasite interactions. The theory should feature three characteristics: (I) replicability, meaning low variation within a clutch, (II) distinctiveness, meaning high variation between clutches, and (III) complexity, meaning the signature is difficult to reproduce.\\nIntraspecies variability in eggshell color and pigmentation can have various causes, making shrikes an interesting but poorly known group of birds. The family includes two genera: Lanius, with 32 species, and Eurocephalus, with 2 species [16,17]. All shrikes lay eggs with distinctive pigmentation, with pigment spots arranged in a ring around the blunt end of the egg. Despite a common pattern within species, pigmentation variation is among the highest in the dozens of bird species studied by Miksik et al. [18]. Another notable observation is that shrikes were once common hosts for cuckoos in Europe, but this parasitism began to decline in the 1960s [19,20]. Although several attempts have been made to determine the reasons for the cuckoo’s withdrawal as a shrike parasite, the potential role of changes in eggshell color has not been explored, despite being observed in other bird species [6,21,22]. In addition, shrikes tend to nest close to one another, but only within a single species. For example, the population of red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio) is increasing in Central Europe, while the ranges of lesser gray shrikes (Lanius minor) and woodchat shrikes (Lanius senator) are shrinking [23,24]. This may be related not only to food availability and varying tolerance to thermal conditions but also to breeding competition, including brood parasitism between species.\\nBased on the findings of Stoddard et al. [6] regarding the presence of individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface, we hypothesize that this phenomenon may have served as a defensive tool to eliminate shrikes as hosts for the cuckoo and to defend against interspecies and intraspecies parasitism within the genus Lanius [25]. This may have contributed to the current distribution of shrike species in Europe. Studying eggshell pigmentation presents challenges, mainly due to the lack of tools to accurately quantify the information hidden in a female’s signature, which birds interpret in ways that are still unknown.\\nDespite existing challenges, researchers have recently focused on analyzing bird egg spottiness using various approaches and appliances. Surmacki et al. [26] found high repeatability in red-backed shrike clutches, suggesting that these traits may be shaped by natural selection. Using principal component analysis, they identified three key egg features: curvature, pigmentation intensity, and contrast. Our study builds on this by using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to explore whether these consistent pigmentation features can be systematically used to identify species accurately across different Lanius species.\\nStoddard et al. [6] developed a new tool, NaturePatternMatch, to check if common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) hosts have evolved distinct, recognizable signatures on their eggs. The NaturePatternMatch tool uses the SIFT algorithm, a computer vision technique that detects, describes, and matches local features within images. However, the algorithm has a limitation because it requires manual parameter configuration. Although Stoddard et al. [6] invested significant effort into manual parameterization, it does not ensure generalizability. In contrast, our approach automates this process as much as possible.\\nLater, Gómez and Liñán-Cembrano [27] presented SpotEgg, a computing infrastructure for analyzing eggshell coloration and spottiness. SpotEgg extracts a wide range of features, as defined by its creators, encompassing geometrical properties, spottiness metrics, fractal dimension, and coloration attributes. It calculates these features for both whole regions of interest and individual spots. While this approach shows promise for gaining valuable insights, its reliance on Matlab licensing and the labor-intensive process of feature examination limit its utility.\\nSince then, both tools have been used in various studies [28,29]. Nevertheless, neither method allows for the explicit identification of species-specific discriminative features on the eggshell surface, as both rely on relative comparisons of image pairs. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of advanced tools to quantify eggshell signature information, leaving a gap in our understanding of how birds perceive these visual signals.\\nIn this study, we aimed to apply XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that serve as species-wide identification signatures. We proposed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify shrike eggs, exploring their potential for rapid and efficient recognition. Furthermore, we applied XAI techniques to investigate correlations between shrike egg identification and the patterns found on their eggshells. We chose CNNs to analyze eggshell pigmentation variability because researchers have found this technology essential in various scientific fields, including disease lesion detection [30], image reconstruction [31–33], gene expression analysis [34,35], and satellite imagery processing [36,37].\\nTo sum up, this study offers the following contributions: (I) We provide a comprehensive dataset of digital images of shrike eggs sourced from diverse locations; (II) We implement a machine learning approach to classify egg images using various image sizes; (III) We demonstrate explainability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) methods to provide insight into the decision-making process of the proposed machine learning model.\\nOur main goal with this comprehensive evaluation framework is to uncover the complex interactions between species classification, pigmentation intensity, and egg shape. We aim to reveal patterns and relationships that go beyond simple visual inspection. This approach not only enriches our understanding of egg pigmentation but also contributes to advancements in studies spanning from ecology to biomedical research, where similar pattern recognition techniques are applied to analyze complex biological structures.\\nResults\\nFirst, we compared the proposed augmentation strategies while training CNN models for the four-class classification task. The results in Table 1 show that medium augmentation provides only a slight improvement in numerical results based on the evaluation performed on the test set. We used 3-fold cross-validation and obtained consistent results, as shown by the mean and standard deviation values in Table 1.\\nSecond, we validated the idea of balancing the dataset by undersampling the majority class (red-backed shrike) and oversampling the minority classes using augmentation schemes. We compare the raw dataset, the dataset with only augmentation (oversampling), and the balanced dataset in Table 2. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation approach in this experiment. The balanced dataset produced the best results, proving the value of this approach.\\nThird, we analyzed the impact of rescaling the input images on the classification results. We tested image sizes of 256 × 256, 128 × 128, and 64 × 64 pixels and compared the results in Table 3, showing the best-performing model values.\\nWe present the example of training scenario details in Figs 1 and 2.\\nThe most common errors involve misclassifying red-backed shrike as woodchat shrike, while the second most frequent mistake is predicting lesser gray shrike instead of woodchat shrike. Correct classifications appear along the diagonal, highlighting the model’s strong accuracy for each species.\\nQualitative results\\nIn this study, we assess Grad-CAM results to evaluate model performance, since other approaches, such as quantitative metrics and localization accuracy, are not applicable or feasible. Quantitative metrics like IoU require ground truth object masks. Similarly, localization accuracy metrics rely on annotated object locations, which is not feasible in this study but could be generated using specialized tools [38]. Our experiment focuses on evaluating model performance by analyzing the correlation between Grad-CAM activations and model confidence scores for correct and incorrect predictions. This approach offers the most relevant and informative way to assess Grad-CAM’s effectiveness. We specifically analyze correct predictions to determine whether the regions highlighted by Grad-CAM align with the most discriminative features that influence the model’s predictions. This assessment provides a complementary perspective that may support the evaluation of SHAP values.\\nIn addition to generating typical Grad-CAM heatmaps for individual instances, we created aggregated images across different classes to represent various species (Fig 3). Aggregating Grad-CAM results consolidates insights from multiple samples or classes, improving interpretability, robustness, and generalization. This approach reduces noise, minimizes bias, and helps identify overarching patterns.\\nEach row corresponds to a specific species (A: red-backed shrike; B: lesser gray shrike; C: great gray shrike; D: woodchat shrike), while each column illustrates accumulations derived from different levels of the VGG16 network. From left to right, these levels include the 2nd convolution block, 3rd convolution block, 4th convolution block, and the final convolution block.\\nQuantitative results\\nWe primarily evaluate SHAP results by visualizing SHAP values overlaid onto input images (Fig 4). Typically, distinct regions representing each class become apparent based on positive values. Adjusting the scale for each example is crucial because the maximum value can vary significantly across instances. This variability across samples makes it challenging to generalize SHAP values across different datasets or populations. Moreover, intricate models often yield SHAP values that are harder to interpret due to their complexity, complicating quantitative evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a method for quantitatively assessing SHAP results by focusing on the major impact of positive SHAP values. Our approach calculates the mean values of positive SHAP values within specific regions of interest, which in this study represent various pigmentation intensities. We segmented these regions from the images using a color segmentation technique with the K-means clustering algorithm. We used a set number of six clusters to calculate binary masks, selecting four clusters, as the last one represented the background.\\nWe also incorporated automatically estimated egg boundary regions, which we then dilated for inclusion in the evaluation process. In addition to calculating mean values, we counted the number of pixels with values falling within the second (Q2) and third quartiles (Q3), which correspond to over 50% and over 75% of the maximum value, respectively (Table 4). Using these metrics, we aimed to explore the correlation between each species, the intensity of pigmentation, and the shape of the egg based on the border region.\\nDiscussion\\nIn examining our deep learning model’s decision-making through XAI techniques, we found that integrating both Grad-CAM and SHAP DeepExplainer was crucial. Grad-CAM enabled us to visually identify the key image regions influencing predictions, improving our understanding of the model’s attention mechanisms. At the same time, SHAP DeepExplainer offered detailed insights into the contributions of individual pixels or regions. By using these XAI tools, we increased transparency and tackled the interpretability challenges of complex deep learning architectures.\\nData collection\\nOur dataset is notably larger than those in similar studies, containing 2236 eggs from 438 clutches across four bird species [26,39,40]. Our dataset also spans a wide geographic area, including Albania, Algeria, Belarus, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, and the West Bank. This extensive dataset supports XAI methods, enhances the validity of our results, and allows for a broader analysis of pigmentation patterns across multiple species.\\nSpecies classification\\nWe employed the VGG16 model, a well-established CNN, in various training scenarios. Initially, we explored three augmentation strategies to assess their influence on the model’s performance. We incorporated rotation into the augmentation process to enhance the model’s ability to handle objects at various angles. Similarly, we used random cropping to improve the model’s resilience to changes in object placement. We also adjusted contrast and brightness to enhance the model’s accuracy and promote more consistent predictions. We observed consistent results across all augmentation methods, demonstrating the model’s strong ability to generalize. For future experiments, we chose heavy augmentation, as it is likely to produce the most invariant model.\\nNext, we addressed the common challenge of imbalanced class distributions in biological and biomedical datasets. We experimented with oversampling techniques, using augmentation and balanced sampling, which involved oversampling minority classes and undersampling majority classes. The results highlighted the positive impact of balancing the dataset on evaluation metrics.\\nThird, we trained and tested the model using images of different sizes. We used three dimensions: 256 × 256 pixels, which represented the largest size with intricate details; 128 × 128 pixels for the second input size; and 64 × 64 pixels for the third size, which significantly reduced the detail. The smallest size provided a coarse representation of the patterned egg image, highlighting only the major features. Despite this reduction in detail, our results remained consistently strong, with only minor decreases in predictions for certain classes. This suggests that the features crucial for classification do not rely solely on fine details or a small number of pixels from high-quality images. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative patterns persist even when resizing images to much smaller dimensions.\\nGrad-CAM heatmaps\\nWe applied the Grad-CAM procedure separately to both Block 5 and Block 4 of the VGG16 architecture, which allowed us to identify and interpret the specific contributions of features at different levels of abstraction. By examining the class activation maps produced from these distinct blocks, we gained insights into the hierarchical importance of various image regions for the model’s predictions.\\nExamining the aggregated heatmaps generated from the final convolution block (Block 5) reveals a significant impact, primarily at the central and blunt end of the egg. Notably, the great gray shrike (the species in row C of Fig 3) exhibits a strong influence on the peripheral area of the images in the final convolution block, which warrants further investigation. Heatmaps from the middle blocks (Blocks 3 and 4) show increased focus on the peripheral areas along the boundary of the egg. Block 4 places slightly more attention on the blunt end. In contrast, the results from Block 2 show visible texture, but no major impact is distinguishable.\\nExploring the separate results can provide additional insights into which structures, such as spots, texture, or color, have the greatest influence on the classification process. This analysis aims to identify the specific features that drive the model’s decision-making, helping us better understand the network’s behavior.\\nRed-backed shrike\\nBased on Block 4 and Block 5, we can infer that the model focuses on both ends of the egg. In Block 4, the attention focuses on the sharp end of the egg, while Block 5 focuses on the opposite, blunt end. Block 5 indicates regions with spots, mainly within the characteristic ring surrounding the blunt end. Surmacki et al. also highlighted the area known as the “crown” in their study on the relationship between red-backed shrike eggshell patterns and egg size [26]. Their findings suggest that features like the crown pattern and pigmentation traits, including contrast differences between the two ends of the egg, have low reproducibility. Miksik et al. note that protoporphyrin IX levels vary significantly in red-backed shrike eggs, potentially influencing XAI’s attention [18]. Positive SHAP values appear in areas corresponding to spots in the egg’s central region, with the greatest impact linked to spots with moderate contrast, rather than the darkest. We highlight the importance of these positive SHAP values, as high-contrast spots may result from environmental factors. The red-backed shrike usually lays five eggs, one per day, exposing each egg to different environmental influences during its formation [41]. SHAP’s focus on spots of moderate contrast suggests that some patterns may be independent of environmental influences and could serve as unique identifiers for the female.\\nConversely, SHAP results reveal a positive impact concentrated near the object’s border, indicating the importance of shape in the decision-making process. DeepExplainer consistently identifies specific spots, which are typically located within the major impact area of the Block 4 Grad-CAM heatmap.\\nLesser gray shrike\\nIn most samples from the lesser gray shrike species, SHAP values concentrate in the egg’s peripheral area, suggesting that the overall shape plays a crucial role in this class. This finding was further supported by quantifying pixels with positive values. Additionally, SHAP values show that regions tend to have more impact than specific spots, indicating a distinctive overall pattern rather than individual spots for this species. More pixels with positive values appeared in cluster_2 than in clusters with lower numbers, further confirming this observation. While Grad-CAM results for this species may seem inconsistent, they consistently focus on the patterned part of the egg, emphasizing its general significance over other features. We suggest that in lesser gray shrikes, individual-specific signatures are encoded in the spatial arrangement of pigment patches, similar to the signatures described for common crane (Grus grus) eggs [42]. The eggs of the lesser gray shrike have a distinctive greenish background that sets them apart from other Lanius species. This makes it easy to identify lesser gray shrike eggs in oological collections and likely prevents birds from accepting parasitic eggs—unless it involves intraspecies parasitism. In such cases, the female’s unique blot pigment pattern in specific areas of the egg may determine whether it is accepted or rejected from the nest.\\nGreat gray shrike\\nSHAP results strongly suggest that the egg’s background color significantly influences the classification of the great gray shrike. The darkest pigmentation spots also have a significant impact, both observable and quantifiable. Overall, all SHAP results consistently highlight that the most patterned and dark-spotted areas are crucial in classifying this species.\\nIn the Grad-CAM evaluation, the model focuses slightly more on the blunt end of the egg. However, the overall trend shows attention across the entire object, without pinpointing any specific region, further confirming the impact of the eggshell’s background color.\\nThe great gray shrike is the largest species in the genus Lanius. Compared to other members of the genus, it builds the highest and best-concealed nests and displays remarkable courage in actively defending them [43]. Consequently, we hypothesize that this species faces the least evolutionary pressure to develop complex individual egg signatures. Instead, the egg’s background color may be sufficient for intraspecies communication between the sexes.\\nWoodchat shrike\\nThe Grad-CAM heatmaps for this class show a remarkable focus, concentrating on small areas of the eggs. This intensity matches the SHAP results, where only a few regions with strong values appear in the analysis. Intriguingly, even in eggs with many spots, the model seems to base its decision on just a few. Further investigation is needed to determine whether size, shape, or color plays a key role in this context.\\nStudies on red-backed shrike egg characteristics suggest that environmental factors primarily influence egg size and shape, rather than shell pigmentation [26]. Consequently, eggshell pigmentation may be a heritable trait, making it more susceptible to evolutionary changes compared to environmental factors. This trait could play a key role in avoiding brood parasitism and, as such, may be shaped by natural selection. However, aside from studies on red-backed shrike eggs, similar relationships have not been explored in other Lanius species. Our study, which includes four species from this genus, suggests that lesser gray shrikes and great gray shrikes focus on developing unique eggshell backgrounds. In contrast, red-backed shrikes and woodchat shrikes depend on specific pigment patterns and spatial arrangements to identify their eggs. These differences may result from various biological factors specific to each species, such as nesting periods, individual body mass, nest height and concealment, and the presence or abundance of predators and nest parasites in breeding habitats.\\nMisclassifications\\nThe most common misclassifications occurred between red-backed shrike and woodchat shrike species. We observed frequent misclassifications in both directions. The CNN assigned probabilities for these misclassified instances ranging from 51% to 98%. This range reflects varying levels of model confidence, from uncertain decisions (around 51%) to highly confident yet incorrect classifications (up to 98%).\\nGrad-CAM heatmaps show focused attention on the spotted areas of the eggs. The SHAP results reveal a noticeable mix of positive and negative values, which contrasts with the true positive classification XAI results, where SHAP values show more consistency. In the misclassified samples, we observe that specific spots have a major impact, highlighting their importance over the shape of the border or the characteristics of the blunt or pointy ends. Conversely, it appears that the model considered the shape of the spots rather than their color when making decisions.\\nThe classifier’s second most common error is predicting lesser gray shrike for images of woodchat shrike. Grad-CAM heatmaps show that the model focuses on patterned areas near the blunt end in these cases. In most instances, positive SHAP values highlight specific spots as key to the classification. The ambiguity of these spots likely caused the misclassification, as the classifier’s probabilities ranged from 53% to 75%.\\nInsights and prospects\\nAs image complexity increases, interpretation becomes much more difficult. The gap in complexity between simple image classification tasks and the detailed analyses required for specific biological questions is vast. In general image interpretation, SHAP DeepExplainer provides clear insights into how individual pixels or features influence model decisions. For instance, in tasks like distinguishing between storks and herons, SHAP easily shows that positive values link to areas with long red beaks and legs, helping to explain the model’s predictions. This simple correlation simplifies interpretation, offering a clear path to understanding why the model makes certain classifications. In contrast to simpler tasks, analyzing the contributions of individual features in more complex scenarios requires deeper analysis.\\nIn this study, we utilized a CNN to develop a model for classifying shrike eggs from museum collections, unlike Chen et al., who applied CNNs to identify poultry eggs [40]. We did not use egg dimensions, as Surmacki et al. did [26], though we collected these measurements and plan to include them in future papers. Inspired by another stimulating research [6], we aimed to address the challenge of identifying individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface, similar to Gómez et al.’s work with the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) using SpotEgg, an image processing software [39]. The authors concluded that evaluating egg phenotypes requires considering all factors—color, pattern, shape, and size—simultaneously. At the same time, Surmacki et al. [26] pointed out the repetitive nature of egg patterns, along with variations in egg size.\\nWe used machine learning models with explainability techniques to identify the specific features that distinguish each species. While the model performed well in predicting species, we found it difficult to identify clear characteristic features. Nonetheless, our investigation revealed general trends, such as the model’s focus on dark or light spots and peripheral areas of the egg. To improve our study, we plan to experiment with handcrafted features specific to characteristic areas of the egg. With further development, our approach could not only enhance our understanding of how birds perceive eggs but also help organize oological collections. In the future, CNNs are expected to verify the species affiliation of eggs in oological collections worldwide. However, researchers have primarily focused on brood parasitism [7,44,45], CNNs are increasingly used for egg classification and detecting parasitic eggs. Recently, Marini et al. [46] conducted an extensive inventory of about 5 million eggs (roughly 1.97 million egg sets) stored in museums worldwide. These collections, built over the past 250 years, peaked in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Afterward, egg collection became restricted and eventually banned in many regions. Today, analyzing eggs from existing collections offers significant and unique research opportunities [47,48]. However, many stored eggs or egg sets lack clear or legible labels. For example, in Europe, many stored eggs need reidentification (verification) due to lost catalogs from the war period. CNNs can improve oological studies by enhancing identification accuracy and increasing the number of observations for specific bird species.\\nConclusion\\nWe conclude the present results of the investigation indicate that the VGG16 deep learning classification model can distinguish between the four Lanius species. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.957 ± 0.015 with input images of size 256 × 256 pixels, which is promising. However, we aim to refine the model further by incorporating a broader spectrum of species during training. Unfortunately, our attempt to utilize XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns for species-wide identification signatures produced inconclusive results. In the future, we hope to identify correlations between features associated with individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface. To achieve this, we plan to apply a hybrid approach that integrates classical image processing techniques, which focus on hand-crafted and more comprehensible features, with deep learning methods. Overall, our approach offers a new way to study how animals perceive signals encoded in eggs.\\nMaterials and methods\\nIn this study, we aimed to apply XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. We established a classification model using a CNN to classify four species of the shrike family (Laniidae): red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), lesser gray shrike (L. minor), great gray shrike (L. excubitor), and woodchat shrike (L. senator). We obtained the image dataset from several museum collections. Collecting eggshell data from bird species is challenging due to ethical considerations that often restrict or prevent sampling from wildlife populations. Consequently, ethical review boards rarely approve large-scale data collection from live specimens, making museum collections a vital resource for avian egg research. Furthermore, we augmented and resized digital images to train the classifier. We selected the VGG16 machine learning model for the classification task, and it produced promising results. Its compatibility and ease of use allowed us to apply XAI techniques, including Grad-CAM and SHAP, to interpret the model’s decisions.\\nData collection, digital photography, and shrike species\\nWe photographed a total of 2236 eggs from 438 nests across four species of the shrike family, Laniidae. This included 1304 eggs from 267 nests of the red-backed shrike (L. collurio), 214 eggs from 41 nests of the lesser gray shrike (L. minor), 376 eggs from 67 nests of the great gray shrike (L. excubitor), and 342 eggs from 62 nests of the woodchat shrike (L. senator). We excluded any nest (clutch) with unclear details, such as uncertain collection year, location, or maternal lineage. This approach also prevented analyzing multiple clutches from the same female.\\nWe took photographs at six sites housing oological collections: five in Poland and one in Germany. These sites are: (1) Świętokrzyski National Park, Bodzentyn, Poland; (2) Count Antoni Ostrowski Museum in Tomaszow Mazowiecki, Poland; (3) Museum and Institute of Zoology Polish Academy of Sciences Research Station, Palmiry, Poland; (4) Museum of Natural History, University of Wrocław, Poland; (5) Jacek Malczewski Museum in Radom, Poland; and (6) Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden, Germany (Fig 5b). Table 5 shows the number of clutches and eggs per species. All eggs used in this study were blown eggs stored in closed cabinets, with no access to light, which prevented any changes in shell color. After removing the eggs from the display case, we measured the mass, length, and width of each shell before proceeding with the photography.\\nPresentation of (A) mounted equipment during one of the photo sessions; (B) drawer with great gray shrike eggs from the Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden, Germany; (C) photographing procedure of a single shrike egg; (D) single red-backed shrike egg with the standardized color chart Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini and a label showing the clutch number; and (E) full clutch of red-backed shrike eggs with the standardized color chart Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini and a genuine collection label.\\nWe took all photos using a Canon® EOS M50 Mark II camera with a Canon® Zoom Lens EF-M 15–45 mm and a Hoya® CIR-PL UV filter. We used the same settings for each photo: aperture f/11, shutter speed 1/60, and ISO 200. Before photographing, we placed the eggs in a shadeless tent, the GlareOne® LED Cube 60 (Fig 5a), along with a standardized color chart, the Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini (Fig 5d,e). We used a tripod and remote control for stability during the process. Each egg was photographed twice: after the first shot, we rotated the egg 180 degrees. In total, we took 4472 photos (2 photos for each of the 2236 eggs).\\nDataset formation\\nWe used our method to automatically create an image database from the collected photographs. Although we took the images following a repetitive scheme, preprocessing [49,50] was essential for AI-driven analysis. We applied an automated method to extract the eggs, cropping them out and organizing them into file-folder structures that efficiently fed the images to the AI model. We manually pruned the dataset to remove artifacts, eggs marked with tags, extraneous objects, and cracked eggs. Ultimately, we curated a dataset of 3260 images, ready for use in CNN training.\\nDeep learning model and implementation\\nIn our experiments, we used the widely recognized VGG16 model [51], adapting its input and output layers to meet our specific objectives (Fig 6). This architecture has proven efficient in a variety of applications, from microscopy scans [52–54] to satellite images [55]. Notably, we initialized the model’s weights randomly. For optimization, we primarily used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-6 and a momentum value of 0.9. We chose the “categorical crossentropy” loss function, a standard option for classification tasks. We set the split for train/validation/test subsets to 0.5/0.2/0.3. Throughout all experiments, we used a consistent batch size of 8.\\nWe implemented the model, along with the training and inference processes, in Python using the Keras framework with TensorFlow as the backend. The open-source nature of the model made it easily accessible, and we obtained it from the publicly available GitHub repository [56]. This Python-based implementation provided flexibility and leveraged Keras and TensorFlow’s capabilities for efficient neural network operations. The VGG16 architecture, proven effective in image classification tasks, was modified to meet our specific classification goals. We used SGD with the categorical cross-entropy loss function, following established practices in training deep neural networks.\\nData augmentation\\nIn situations with very few examples, data augmentation can improve the quality of the results. In our study, we used the Albumentations package [57] to modify the images. To systematically introduce diversity, we applied three distinct augmentation strategies: simple, medium, and heavy.\\nSimple.\\nThe simple augmentation involved only vertical and horizontal flips, with image rotation restricted to 180 degrees. This type of augmentation has a minimal impact on image content since it does not affect the pixel values. Nevertheless, it can enhance the model’s training capabilities by making it agnostic to the left-right orientation of the egg.\\nMedium.\\nIn addition to simple augmentation, this strategy included further distortions such as image rotation and random cropping. These transformations applied multiple geometric changes, altering the position of objects within the images.\\nHeavy.\\nAlong with simple and medium augmentations, the heavy option provided additional distortions in brightness and contrast to make the model agnostic to light conditions and automatic camera white balance adjustments. The Albumentation functions used in the heavy augmentation option included: VerticalFlip (p = 0.5), HorizontalFlip (p = 0.5), Rotate (limit=[0,180], p = 0.5), RandomSizedCrop (p = 0.5), RandomBrightnessContrast (p = 0.5), and RandomGamma (p = 0.5).All of the above strategies improve the generalization of knowledge. However, we designed each strategy to cater to different levels of augmentation intensity, allowing us to explore the impact of augmentation on model performance across a range of complexities.\\nFurthermore, we used augmentation techniques to balance the dataset. Notably, we applied the most augmentation to the least populated class to address the imbalance effectively. This approach is crucial for maintaining high accuracy and avoiding misclassifications, especially in applications where each class or category holds equal importance.\\nThe open-source Albumentations package provided a solid foundation for applying these augmentation techniques efficiently. By using these strategies, we enhanced the flexibility of our experimental setup, improving the model’s ability to learn from a limited set of examples. This augmentation process was crucial in overcoming data scarcity challenges, making our trained model more robust and better at generalizing.\\nXAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)\\nXAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) aims to demystify complex machine learning models by making their decision-making processes understandable to humans [58]. In our study, we used XAI methods, such as Grad-CAM and SHAP, to clarify how our model reaches conclusions. These methods highlight influential regions in images, enabling researchers and users to interpret and trust the model’s outputs. This promotes transparency in artificial intelligence systems.\\nGrad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)\\nGrad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) [59] is a powerful XAI technique that visualizes the regions of an image that strongly influence a deep learning model’s decision. Grad-CAM operates on the final convolutional layer of a CNN, just before the global average pooling and fully connected layers. This layer retains spatial information essential for understanding the model’s decision-making. The process starts by computing the gradients of the target class with respect to the feature maps of the convolutional layer. These gradients represent the importance of each feature map in the decision for the target class. By averaging the gradients for each feature map, we obtain the importance weight for each channel. Next, we compute a weighted combination of the feature maps using these importance weights. This generates a class activation map that highlights the regions of the input image that most influenced the model’s prediction for the target class. To create a visual interpretation, we rescale the class activation map and overlay it onto the original input image. This overlay emphasizes the critical areas that influenced the model’s decision, providing a clear and interpretable'}\n",

Here\\'s an example of GZDoom, and I\\'ll start with flame scopes for both CPU and GPU utilization, with details annotated:\\n(Here are the raw CPU and GPU versions.) FlameScope shows a subsecond-offset heatmap of profile samples, where each column is one second (in this example, made up of 50 x 20ms blocks) and the color depth represents the number of samples, revealing variance and perturbation that you can select to generate a flame graph just for that time range. Update: the row size can be ajusted (it is limited by the sample rate captured in the profile), e.g., you could generate 60 rows to match 60fps games.\\nPutting these CPU and GPU flame scopes side by side has enabled your eyes to do pattern matching to solve what would otherwise be a time-consuming task of performance correlation. The gaps in the GPU flame scope on the right – where the GPU was not doing much work – match the heavier periods of CPU work on the left.\\nCPU Analysis\\nFlameScope lets us click on the interesting periods. By selecting one of the CPU shader compilation stripes we get the flame graph just for that range:\\nThis is brilliant, and we can see exactly why the CPUs were busy for about 180 ms (the vertical length of the red stripe): it\\'s doing compilation of GPU shaders and some NIR preprocessing (optimizations to the NIR intermediate representation that Mesa uses internally). If you are new to flame graphs, you look for the widest towers and optimize them first. Here is the interactive SVG.\\nCPU flame graphs and CPU flame scope aren\\'t new (from 2011 and 2018, both open source). What is new is full-stack GPU flame graphs and GPU flame scope.\\nGPU Analysis\\nInteresting details can also be selected in the GPU FlameScope for generating GPU flame graphs. This example selects the \"room 3\" range, which is a room in the Doom map that contains hundreds of enemies. The green frames are the actual instructions running on the GPU, aqua shows the source for these functions, and red (C) and yellow (C++) show the CPU code paths that initiated the GPU programs. The gray \"-\" frames just help highlight the boundary between CPU and GPU code. (This is similar to what I described in the AI flame graphs post, which included extra frames for kernel code.) The x-axis is proportional to cost, so you look for the widest things and find ways to reduce them.\\nI\\'ve included the interactive SVG version of this flame graph so you can mouse-over elements and click to zoom. (PNG version.)\\nThe GPU flame graph is split between stalls coming from rendering walls (41.4%), postprocessing effects (35.7%), stenciling (17.2%), and sprites (4.95%). The CPU stacks are further differentiated by the individual shaders that are causing stalls, along with the reasons for those stalls.\\nGZDoom\\nWe picked GZDoom to try since it\\'s an open source version of a well known game that runs on Linux (our profiler does not support Windows yet). Intel Battlemage makes light work of GZDoom, however, and since the GPU profile is stall-based we weren\\'t getting many samples. We could have switched to a more modern and GPU-demanding game, but didn\\'t have any great open source ideas, so I figured we\\'d just make GZDoom more demanding. We built GPU demanding maps for GZDoom (I can\\'t believe I have found a work-related reason to be using Slade), and also set some Battlemage tunables to limit resources, magnifying the utilization of remaining resources.\\nOur GZDoom test map has three rooms: room 1 is empty, room 2 is filled with torches, and room 3 is open with a large skybox and filled with enemies, including spawnpoints for Sergeants. This gave us a few different workloads to examine by walking between the rooms.\\nUsing iaprof: Intel\\'s open source accelerator profiler\\nThe AI Flame Graph project is pioneering work, and has needed various changes to graphics compilers, libraries, and kernel drivers, not just the code but also how they are built. Since Intel has its own public cloud (the Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud) we can fix the software stack in advance so that for customers it \"just works.\" Check the available releases. It currently supports the Intel Max Series GPU.\\nIf you aren\\'t on the Intel cloud, or you wish to try this with Intel Battlemage, then it can require a lot of work to get the system ready to be profiled. Requirements include:\\n- A Linux system with superuser (root) access, so that eBPF and Intel eustalls can be used.\\n- A newer Linux kernel with the latest Intel GPU drivers. For Intel Battlemage this means Linux 6.15+ with the Xe driver; For the Intel Max Series GPU it\\'s Linux 5.15 with the i915 driver.\\n- The Linux kernel built with Intel driver-specific eustall and eudebug interfaces (see the github docs for details). Some of these modifications are upstreamed in the latest versions of Linux and others are currently in progress. (These interfaces are made available by default on the Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud.)\\n- All system libraries or programs that are being profiled need to include frame pointers so that the full stacks are visible, including Intel\\'s oneAPI and graphics libraries. For this example, GZDoom itself needed to be compiled with frame pointers and also all libraries used by GZDoom (glibc, etc.). This is getting easier in the lastest versions of Fedora and Ubuntu (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) which are shipping system libraries with frame pointers by default. But I\\'d expect there will be applications and dependencies that don\\'t have frame pointers yet, and need recompilation. If your flame graph has areas that are very short, one or two frames deep, this is why.\\nIf you are new to custom kernel builds and library tinkering, then getting this all working may feel like Nightmare! difficulty. Over time things will improve and gradually get easier: check the github docs. Intel can also develop a much easier version of this tool as part of a broader product offering and get it working on more than just Linux and Battlemage (either watch this space or, if you have an Intel rep, ask them to make it a priority).\\nOnce you have it all working, you can run the iaprof command to profile the GPU. E.g.:\\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/intel/iaprof cd iaprof make deps make sudo iaprof record > profile.txt cat profile.txt | iaprof flame > flame.svg\\niaprof is modeled on the Linux perf command. (Maybe one day it\\'ll become included in perf directly.) Thanks to Gabriel Muñoz for getting the work done to get this open sourced.\\nFAQ and Future Work\\nFrom the launch of AI flame graphs last year, I can guess what FAQ #1 will be: “What about NVIDIA?”. They do have flame graphs in Nsight Graphics for GPU workloads, although their flame graphs are currently shallow as it is GPU code only, and onerous to use as I believe it requires an interposer; on the plus side they have click-to-source. The new GPU profiling method we\\'ve been developing allows for easy, everything, anytime profiling, like you expect from CPU profilers.\\nFuture work will include github releases, more hardware support, and overhead reduction. We\\'re the first to use eustalls in this way, and we need to add more optimization to reach our target of <5% overhead, especially with the i915 driver.\\nConclusion\\nWe\\'ve open sourced AI flame graphs and tested it on new hardware, Intel Battlemage, and a non-AI workload: GZDoom (gaming). It\\'s great to see a view of both CPU and GPU resources down to millisecond resolution, where we can see visual patterns in the flame scope heat maps that can be selected to produce flame graphs to show the code. We applied these new tools to GZDoom and explained GPU pauses by selecting the corresponding CPU burst and reading the flame graph, as well as GPU code use for arbitrary time windows.\\nWhile we have open sourced this, getting it all running requires Intel hardware and Linux kernel and library tinkering – which can be a lot of work. (Actually playing Doom on Nightmare! difficulty may be easier.) This will get better over time. We look forward to seeing if anyone can fight their way through this work in the meantime and what new performance issues they can solve.\\nAuthors: Brendan Gregg, Ben Olson, Brandon Kammerdiener, Gabriel Muñoz.\\nClick here for Disqus comments (ad supported).'}\n",

With the advent of new technology, cybercriminals have upped their game to bypass conventional fraud detection systems. In response to this global crisis, AI expert Pallav Kumar Kaulwar has published his insightful research highlighting the role of\\nHis published paper “Generative AI in Financial Intelligence: Unraveling its Potential in Risk Assessment and Compliance” explains how emerging financial threats can be simulated, detected, and neutralized by deep learning architectures such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), Bayesian neural networks, and variation auto encoders.\\nA New Approach to Fraud Detection\\nEvery year, financial frauds account for the loss of billions of dollars around the world. Unfortunately, conventional detection methods have failed to keep up with this growing concern. Rule-based engines relying on fixed thresholds and historical fraud signatures are no match for today’s technologically astute cybercriminals.\\nIn his research, Kaulwar has identified several limitations of the traditional fraud detection models. Most importantly, static rules can be bypassed effortlessly by fraudsters that continuously evolve their methods with each breach. Also, though supervised learning models are powerful, they need extensive labeled datasets, which are difficult to find for new fraud types. Finally, traditional models are known to generate a high volume of false positives.\\n“The industry needs a shift from reaction to prediction,” says Kaulwar. “Today’s fraud detection must be dynamic, data-rich, and capable of identifying new patterns as they emerge-before they escalate into large-scale breaches.”\\nKaulwar believes that generative AI’s ability to create, simulate, and test a wide range of scenarios can be a game changer in this context. Institutions can proactively identify fraudulent transactions and intervene in real-time by training models to mimic normal as well as abnormal behavior.\\nEnhancing Financial Surveillance with Generative AI\\nUnlike traditional analytics, generative AI has the capability to generate synthetic data mirroring real-world financial behaviors. Therefore, organizations can build robust detection models, even if they don’t have extensive fraud datasets. Financial institutions can leverage tools such as GANs to simulate thousands of behavior scenarios, identity patterns, and transaction paths. As a result, it is possible to detect vulnerabilities that are missed by static models.\\nLeveraging this approach, Kaulwar’s framework creates\\nIn the context of AML (Anti-Money Laundering), complex layering and structuring techniques used by criminals can be simulated by generative models. When used to train detection engines, these simulations can enhance their sensitivity to subtle laundering signals. Generative models can also prevent payment fraud by creating behavioral biometrics capable of identifying account takeovers based on session anomalies or keystroke dynamics.\\nIt is possible to update generative AI systems in real-time with new fraud data, ensuring quick adaptation to new attack vectors. They can also be integrated seamlessly with existing financial intelligence platforms.\\nHuman-in-the-Loop Oversight\\nOne of the key aspects of Kaulwar’s research is the balance between automation and human judgment. According to him, while AI is critical to scalability and speed, human oversight remains essential for ethical alignment, governance, and contextual decision-making. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) design of his framework ensures that only experts are involved in validation and escalation of critical fraud decisions.\\nThe growing concerns around AI explainability are also addressed by Kaulwar’s framework. In addition to detecting frauds, financial institutions should explain why a particular transaction was flagged. In his generative systems, explainable AI (XAI) modules present a clear rationale for each alert by tracing the decision path of the AI model.\\nThis dual-layer approach is critical to enabling regulatory resilience. Every second matters in fast-moving environments like the capital market. While initial detection is handled by frontline AI, compliance teams are engaged in reviewing and responding to critical incidents.\\nConclusion\\nAs fraudsters are now evolving their tactics using advanced technology, financial institutions must evolve even faster to stay ahead of them. Kaulwar’s research provides an actionable framework for building intelligent, proactive, explainable, and resilient fraud detection systems. His insights can help financial institutions meet the challenges of an increasingly digital, complex, and high-speed financial landscape.\\n“Generative AI represents a major step forward into a future where machines are not only learning to recognize forms and patterns but also have an imagination of their own. This imagination integrates into our processes and contexts, capturing human potential for interpreting vast financial data that has hardly been tapped. Such systems enable us to work constructively with data oases rather than be limited by data droughts,” Kaulwar concludes.'}\n",

This collaborative study explores how\\nWith over a decade of experience in Oracle technologies, cloud computing, and enterprise integration, Polineni has a track record of addressing real-world healthcare challenges leveraging his technical acumen. Through his research, he has highlighted the potential of generative neural networks, real-time data integration, and predictive analytics for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma environments.\\nEmergency Care through AI\\nEmergency departments (EDs) are extremely resource-intensive units that are known to operate under tremendous pressure, attending patients with varying degrees of severity and often missing or incomplete health records. Clinicians in these units are often required to make life-altering decisions within tight timeframes on the basis of limited information. Any inefficiency in triage or delay in diagnosis can significantly affect patient outcomes in such environments.\\nThrough his research, Polineni has recommended a fundamental shift in how facilities structure emergency care. He mentions that clinical decision-making can be augmented with data-driven insights by introducing AI tools. These systems can analyze vast datasets in real time, including patient histories, environmental variables, imaging results, and physiological data to generate probabilistic assessments of severity and risk. By identifying critical conditions before symptoms escalate, AI empowers emergency departments to transition from reactive to proactive care.\\nDiagnostic and triage procedures can also be standardized by AI, which reduces human error and subjectivity. This can be extremely beneficial in under-resourced or rural settings where availability of trained specialists can be a concern. In order to reduce misdiagnoses, increase efficiency, and save lives, hospitals can embed intelligent tools throughout their emergency response workflow.\\nEarly Diagnosis and Prognosis\\nThe core concept of Polineni’s research revolves around advanced generative neural network models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These models are extremely efficient in early diagnosis and prognostic modeling, two most acute challenges in trauma care. These models are custom engineered to overcome practical issues such as variability in patient presentations, data scarcity, and lack of consistent expert labeling in clinical data.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating synthetic patient data mirroring diagnostic patterns or real-world imaging, which provides training datasets for underrepresented or rare conditions. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can compress and reconstruct medical images efficiently. This improves detection of features and patterns that might elude the human eye.\\nIt is possible to train these models to identify the subtle indicators of conditions such as sepsis, internal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and even complex multi-organ failure within moments. These tools can empower physicians to make decisions reflecting immediate as well as long-term implications of trauma.\\nReal-Time Decision Support Systems\\nThe concept of decision support systems has been used in the healthcare sector for many years. However, Polineni claims that the integration of\\nAdaptability is one of the key compatibilities of these systems. Whether deployed in a remote field hospital or a bustling metropolitan trauma center, real-time DSS can scale as per the requirement. They assist in resource allocation, prioritize patients during a surge, and even coordinate care handovers between facilities.\\nAI for Enhancing Triage and Emergency Response\\nAs it is the foundational step in emergency care, any delay or misclassification at the triage stage can lead to life-threatening consequences. In his study, Polineni has discussed AI-enhanced triage models that are not only capable of accelerating patient sorting, but also improving accuracy by factoring in subtle indicators that human indicators tend to miss.\\nUsing large datasets to train generative models, these systems can detect time-critical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, internal bleeding, or early signs of sepsis. By helping track patient disposition, AI ensuring continuity of care from pre-hospital settings to specialized treatment facilities.\\nField Applications\\nPolineni has illustrated the impact of AI-driven DSS through a series of real-world use cases.\\n- Pediatric Trauma Triage: By training AI tools on pediatric-specific datasets, clinicians can be assisted in identifying atypical vital sign patterns. This can help detect serious injuries such as concussion or internal bleeding in a timely manner.\\n- Emergency Radiology Interpretation: AI algorithms trained on thousands of annotated images can precisely identify anomalies in MRI or CT scans. By highlighting suspected areas of concern, these tools allow radiologists to reduce interpretation time during peak hours and prioritize critical cases.\\n- Prehospital Trauma Response: Equipped with AI-assisted mobile devices, emergency responders can input basic patient data on-site. Based on this data, the system generates a severity index and recommends the most suitable facility.\\n- Burn and Wound Severity Assessment: Based on historical outcomes, AI-enhanced image analysis can detect infection risk, classify burn depths, and recommend treatment protocols.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nTulasi Naga Subhash Polineni’s research has created a comprehensive blueprint that can define the future of trauma and acute care leveraging AI-driven decision support systems.\\n“Our aim is not just to enhance diagnostic accuracy but to fundamentally rethink how trauma and acute care can be delivered-faster, smarter, and more personalized,” concludes Tulasi Naga Subhash Polineni. “AI-driven decision support systems hold the potential to bridge critical care gaps, reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately save lives in time-sensitive emergencies. By integrating real-time insights into existing clinical workflows, we can empower caregivers to act with greater precision when it matters most.”\"}\n",

The company did not say how much of that investment converted to equity in the first quarter, but it now values its overall stake in the AI startup at $13.8 billion, the filing says.\\nA shift from convertible notes to equity is commonly made when a convertible note reaches a milestone — such as a funding threshold, valuation target, or maturity date — leading a shift from debt-like terms to equity ownership under the original investment agreement.\\nThe $3.3 billion pre-tax gain came from a change in how the investment is counted on Amazon’s books. When the company held convertible notes, any increase in their value didn’t show up in its profits. With those notes converting into stock, Amazon was required to move those paper gains onto its income statement — effectively turning them into real profit for accounting purposes.\\nThe gain boosted Amazon’s first-quarter results, which included net income (after tax) of $17.1 billion, or $1.59 per share — well above analyst expectations of $1.36 per share.\\nThe size of the investment gain reflects just how much Anthropic’s value has grown since 2023, when Amazon announced its initial investment in the San Francisco-based AI company.\\nThe startup, which also makes the Sonnet AI model, was valued at $61.5 billion in its March funding round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world, according to a Bloomberg News report at the time.\\nAmazon’s partnership with Anthropic goes beyond investment.

CSI: Cyber, on the other hand, lasted just two seasons. Past audiences, it seems, preferred plots with crimes like murder and burglary over more esoteric topics like ARP spoofing and DNS poisoning.\\nWith an RSAC 2025 Conference panel titled “Hot! Sizzling Cyber Law Topics,” four lawyers spotlight the unique challenges of current criminal law in the cyber realm, from the rights of AI holograms to the privacy of your own thoughts.\\nRuth Bro, a privacy and cybersecurity attorney, noted that we have been concerned about technology affecting our privacy for decades. She offered numerous examples from music and film and highlighted an 1890 law review article by Louis Brandeis (long before he joined the Supreme Court) on the right to privacy, spurred at the time by the spread of cheap photography.\\nBro offered an acronym for the biggest dangers technology brings to privacy: BAD, short for biometrics, AI, and drones. “Biometric is one of the most sensitive types of data,” she said. “And AI holds staggering amounts of personal data.”\\nAs for drones, she offered examples both good and bad. Insurance companies fly drones over your property. If you don\\'t take care of it, they could raise your rates or drop your coverage entirely. On the other hand, having a drone fly in ahead of first responders can get help to victims faster and decrease risks to the responders.\\nAI Hologram Rights and Wrongs\\nTed Claypoole, partner at Womble Bond Dickinson LLP, spoke about replacing human performers with AI-powered holograms. He highlighted the Elvis Evolution Experience, coming to London this summer, as an example of how far the entertainment industry can go if allowed. This performance has the blessing of The King’s estate, so there’s no legal trouble.\\nBefore AI deepfakes, we did see hologram shows, most notably Tupac Shakur’s posthumous performance. Anyone wanting to fight such usage would have to rely on deceptive practice laws, trademark and copyright protection, and state-specific laws protecting a person\\'s name, image, and likeness. But that’s changing.\\nTennessee has passed the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and Image Security Act (yes, it spells ELVIS), which prohibits deepfakes and makes publishing them a class A misdemeanor. “You can sue,” noted Claypoole, “or the record company can sue on behalf of the artist.” And it’s also a crime. Claypoole concluded that if you make an AI hologram, you’d better use someone long dead or get permission. Similarly, the Take It Down Act cleared the US Congress, which makes creating or publishing non-consensual deepfake images or videos a federal crime.\\nRegulators Take Aim at Algorithmic Discrimination\\nLucy Thomson, principal at Livingston PLLC, spotlighted regulations restricting companies from using AI in software development. She highlighted the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, which takes effect in February 2026, that requires developers and deployers of AI-powered software to protect customers from algorithmic discrimination in high-risk systems.\\nEnsure humans are in control, not just in the loop.\\n\"A high-risk system is one that makes a substantial factor in making a consequential decision about a consumer,” she explained. Specifically, this affects decisions relating to education, employment, lending, government services, health, housing, insurance, and legal actions. The European Union provides similar, but broader, protections. She concluded the most crucial point is to “ensure humans are in control, not just in the loop.”\\nThe Federal Government Tackles AI Washing\\n“New! Improved! Now with AI!” How many times have you heard that pitch? Kristin Madigan, partner at Crowell & Moring, discussed new laws against “AI washing,” which she explained consists of “representations to the market where you use AI to supercharge existing deceptive practices, or overstate AI capabilities.”\\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have all shown an interest in controlling these deceptive practices. “Your claims about AI had better be true,” concluded Moring.\\nThe Rise of \\'Neuro Privacy\\'\\nClaypoole reclaimed the mic to discuss what he calls “I know what you thought last summer.”\\nStay Safe With the Latest Security News and Updates\\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\\n“It’s an interesting area,” he said. “You think we’re talking about the future, but we’re not.” He flagged an article in The Atlantic from 2013 where the author sat for a test using an fMRI machine while viewing pictures. Even a layperson looking at the fMRI could tell what he thought about the photos, and the article posed the question, \"Could the government get a search warrant for your thoughts?\"\\nI know what you thought last summer.\\nIn the modern world, devices of all kinds record data related to our thinking. Some truckers wear hats that detect sleepiness. Other gadgets include headbands, wristbands, earbuds, smart glasses, and even implanted brain links.\\nAlways forward-looking, the EU has proposed five human rights in the area of neurodata: cognitive liberty (the freedom to opt out of having your mental processes recorded or modified), mental privacy (the freedom to conceal mental information), mental integrity (a prohibition on non-consensual changes to a person’s thinking), psychological continuity (the right to preserve your identity from non-consensual modification), and fair access (ensuring that positive outcomes in the neuro field are shared fairly).\\nSoftware Supply Chain Hacks Are Expensive Legal Problems\\nLucy Thomson mentioned that attacks on the software supply chain, like the major attacks on SolarWinds, Log4j, and the Kaseya ransomware attack, all have significant legal ramifications that often go undiscussed. She noted that the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) maintains a detailed document on software supply chain attacks.\\n“Cybersecurity attacks can expose attorneys to third-party liability,” said Thomson. She cited several examples that settled for $8 million or more and suggested that law firms must consider the risks of such lawsuits and hold software vendors accountable for security outcomes.\\nWhat Overturning Chevron Means for Cybersecurity\\nFor over 40 years, the Chevron deference held that when a federal law needs interpretation, that task is best left to experts in the agency responsible for the law. The Supreme Court invalidated that doctrine last year.\\nMadigan reviewed the consequences and explained that “courts will have greater authority to overturn or modify laws.” She continued, “When it comes to cybersecurity, many federal regulations predate modern cyber threats. We’re more likely to see court challenges in cyber-related decisions.”\\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, many federal regulations pre-date modern cyber threats.\\nMadigan says we’ll likely see more rollbacks on rules and regulations when it comes to information security. According to the Center for Cybersecurity Policy, this could mean more companies going to court to challenge cybersecurity and privacy laws, including federal regulations on when and how companies have to report security breaches to clients and customers, for example.\\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\\nWhat can the legal profession do to stay ahead of the collision between law and cybersecurity? Quoting Peter Parker’s uncle Ben, Bro observed that “with great power comes great responsibility.” For example, just because widespread surveillance is possible doesn’t mean it’s a wise choice. She advised holding software vendors accountable for security. “Don’t be creepy,” she admonished. “I tell people, before you do that, think about whether you’ll look good on the cover of the Wall Street Journal.”\\nCybersecurity-related plotlines are already appearing in popular TV legal dramas, and we’ll only see more going forward. Who knows, the topics from this discussion may be the plotlines for coming episodes.\\nRead the latest from Neil J.

Whether leading strategy at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or launching generative AI tools to combat financial crime at Fintrac, Lalonde says he’s always been chasing that same feeling: “In every single one of my jobs, I was always looking to make that difference.”\\nBridging tech and trust in the public sector\\nAt IAAC, Lalonde is guiding the agency through another ambitious transformation. This time, it’s about applying artificial intelligence to one of the most complex and politically sensitive mandates in government: environmental impact assessment.\\n“Our job is to look at all the major projects in Canada — pipelines, offshore drilling, mines — and find a balance of advancing these projects and preserving the environment,” he explains. That includes meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities, which his team has made more accessible through redesigned digital platforms.\\nBut faster doesn’t mean automated. Lalonde is clear that AI isn’t replacing the human judgment at the heart of these decisions — it’s supporting it. In fact, that’s the core of his strategy: using AI to enhance, not override, the critical thinking, values, and responsibilities that define public service.\\nOne of the biggest barriers to adoption, he says, is fear — fear among staff that AI is coming for their jobs.\\n“When we built a model specifically to say we are not going to replace you… all of a sudden that fear started to diminish,” he says. “Then you could get to that conversation where the user is like, okay, I’m going to use this thing. I’m actually going to expand my capability.”\\nBy tackling that fear head-on, Lalonde is opening the door to meaningful, sustained adoption that prioritizes people over hype and maintains public trust.\\nAI isn’t a tool — it’s a capability\\nWhat makes Lalonde’s approach unique is his emphasis on AI literacy across all roles, not just among developers or technical teams.\\n“We don’t see [AI] as technology. We see it as a business capability,” he says.\\nHis team uses a four-level capability matrix to guide adoption:\\nLevel 1 – Awareness and experimentation: Staff are introduced to AI through simple, practical tasks — summarizing documents, rewording text, drafting emails — using tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and other government-supported platforms. The goal is to build confidence through hands-on use.\\nLevel 2 – Structured use and analysis: Users begin learning how to properly capture and structure information in AI platforms.

Since then, businesses have been racing to monetize AI and seamlessly integrate it into daily operations. Now, in 2025, those ambitions are materializing, giving the world a clearer vision of what an AI-powered business landscape looks like.\\nIn this piece, we’ll explore how AI has moved from niche to normal, examine the key forces reshaping the world of work and try to get a sense of where we’re headed.\\nDirector of Partner Development for EMEA at Laserfiche.\\nWhat does AI look like in 2025?\\nIn 2025, AI is no longer an experiment. Companies have moved beyond testing and are deploying AI at scale. Agentic AI chatbots can now recommend products and complete transactions autonomously, while AI-powered fraud prevention help detect and prevent scams. AI isn’t just emerging—it’s here.\\nAccording to McKinsey, five forces are defining AI in the workplace in 2025: improved intelligence and reasoning, agentic AI enabling autonomous robot workers, multimodality that integrates text, audio, and video, and increased transparency through better reasoning and clearer explanations of its processes.\\nWorkers are using AI to be more creative. A report by Deloitte found that 70% of workers are open to offloading tasks to AI to free up time and boost creativity, yet 28% worry about technology threatening their jobs. AI is both a blessing and a curse—while it reduces mundane work, it also raises concerns about job security.\\nAnd better reasoning is giving businesses more confidence in AI models. Looking back on AI’s early days, many remember its tendency toward bias and its ability to confidently present falsehoods. To address this, large language models are increasingly including explanations of their reasoning or cite sources. A notable example is China’s DeepSeek model, which impressed with its whitepaper outlining the importance of reasoning in large language models.\\nThen there’s the rise of AI-powered tools in Enterprise Content management Systems (ECM), making document management smarter and more intuitive. People are so accustomed to AI in their daily lives—whether it’s Google Maps or Alexa—that they expect similar automation at work. These systems don’t just organize and secure business data; they also streamline tedious processes like onboarding and contract management. By automating routine paperwork, AI is freeing employees to focus on more creative, high-value tasks.\\nLike all technological change, there’s a lot happening, and this is just scratching the surface, but those who can harness AI stand to gain a lot. According to McKinsey, the long-term opportunity that AI presents in added productivity growth from corporate use cases is around $4.4 trillion.\\nSupercharged cyber risk\\nBut it’s not all good news. While AI has boosted businesses, it has also made malicious cyber activity more prolific and dangerous. Threat actors are using AI to automate attacks, develop advanced phishing and social engineering tactics, and are leveraging deepfakes and generative AI tech to deceive employees and exploit vulnerabilities more efficiently. In response, businesses in 2025 are locking down their data and investing more heavily in information governance.\\nThis is part of the reason businesses are assessing their records management practices and ECMs. Because cyber attackers are finding increasingly sophisticated ways to exploit data, businesses are locking down the attack surface by securing their data and documents, and ensuring the proper access controls and audit trails are in place. ECMs help organizations centralize digital sensitive documents, providing version control and enhanced security.\\nAnother factor driving businesses toward ECM is data integrity. AI is only as powerful as the data it’s trained on, yet 67% of organizations admit they don’t fully trust their own data for decision-making. Proper data indexing not only improves AI performance today but also lays the foundation for future scalability. These systems allow for automated document management, ensuring data remains structured and accessible.\\nHuman-centered tech is the future\\nAI in 2025 is a lot like hybrid work: by balancing automation with human oversight, businesses and workers can reap the benefits of efficiency while reducing mundane tasks.\\nCertainly, there are some risks. While AI is freeing employees from routine tasks and enabling more strategic work, some roles are shifting toward refinement and review of AI output—raising concerns that critical thinking skills could erode in the process. At the same time, some businesses that have made big bets on AI aren’t yet seeing the expected returns. This is because we’re only just exiting the pilot phase. Almost 90% of business leaders anticipate that AI will drive revenue growth in the next three years.\\nBusinesses that automate their business processes using tools like ECMs — which can support the quick rollout of automated solutions with drag-and-drop tools or prebuilt templates — have more time to train their staff. According to a report by IBM, 62% of organizations are already using AI to personalize learning content for employees, leading to a more engaging and effective training experience, keeps their critical thinking skills sharp and ensuring they’re ready for further digital transformation.\\nMcKinsey’s report highlights the immense potential of AI, but businesses must be agile to truly capitalize on it. The technology is advancing so quickly that the best opportunities could emerge from various areas—talent, new business models, or competitive products. Organizations must also invest in workers who can drive this transition.\\nInterestingly, Millennials—the largest generational cohort in the workforce—are among AI’s most vocal champions. As they take on more leadership roles, they are becoming natural overseers of AI adoption. But regardless of generation, businesses that prioritize employee training and equip their teams with the skills to leverage AI effectively will come out ahead. And that’s already proving true in 2025.\\nWe\\'ve featured the best online learning platform.\\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro\\'s Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is not—this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google\\'s advanced AI models, has been available on the web since 2023, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it\\'s not yet available to install.\\nUntil now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing is live in the Play Store early. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you\\'ll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being.\\nNotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google\\'s other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent.

Or get hijacked by a teen?\\nRSAC If Amazon\\'s Alexa+ works as intended, it could show how an AI assistant helps with everyday tasks like making dinner reservations or arranging an oven repair. Or things could go terribly wrong: it might turn on the oven and turn dinner plans into a house fire.\\nThis is why the e-commerce giant brought in security engineers, including both red teams and penetration testers, to work alongside product developers from the beginning, according to Amazon CISO Amy Herzog.\\nTheir job was to anticipate what could go wrong and ensure safety and security guardrails were in place to prevent Alexa+ from jumping the track.\\n\"It\\'s funny how, having been in both seats, the product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system,\" Herzog told The Register on the outskirts of the RSA Conference in San Francisco this week.\\n\"Whenever you\\'re talking about a system that can take actions on behalf of someone our immediate [reaction is]: Wouldn\\'t it be good if, like me, as someone who\\'s running this household could just say, This is what I need to go shopping for. These are the dinner reservations I need to make. Go make that happen. Schedule a delivery window,\" she said.\\n\"And then my kid comes into the kitchen and says, and also 50 pepperoni pizzas for me and my friends.\"\\nThe product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system\\nWhile the developers tend to focus on the product\\'s potential — this is what they could build, and here are all the amazing, new things it could do — it\\'s the red team\\'s job to burst that bubble, or at least point out what could go wrong to ensure that systems are isolated and security mechanisms are put in place to prevent unintended or malicious consequences.\\n\"So having both of those in the same design meeting is really beneficial, because then even the product engineer is like, \\'Oh yeah, you\\'re right. I would totally order pizzas.\\' How do we make sure the system can handle that kind of thing?\"\\nHerzog is one of four chief information security officers (CISOs) across the e-commerce giant, and she\\'s responsible for infosec across ads and devices — so Alexa and the next-gen Alexa+ fall under her purview.\\nThe personal assistant, available only to Amazon-approved early testers at this point, is built on top of Amazon\\'s LLMs, and the company claims it can orchestrate actions across tens of thousands of services and devices to do things like control smart-home products, order groceries, play music, and make dinner reservations while remembering friends and family members\\' dietary restrictions and restaurant preferences.\\nAmazon says it can also interact with third-party AI agents on behalf of users. In an example used by Herzog, this means that if your oven breaks, Alexa+ can go online, use a system like Thumbtack to find a repairperson in your area, schedule the repair, and then tell you when it\\'s fixed.\\n\"And this kind of a product has, as you might imagine, a number of unique security considerations,\" Herzog said. \"All the same attacks are still there. In that sense, not much has changed. But since these things are non-deterministic, you have to really build in ways to understand its behavior in a different way than if you\\'re working with a deterministic system.\"\\nIn this case, non-deterministic means you can give Alexa+ (or any other AI assistant) the exact same input, or query, and it will spit out a slightly different output every time.\\n- Amazon to kill off local Alexa processing, all voice requests shipped to the cloud\\n- \\'Error\\' causes Alexa to endorse Kamala Harris, refuse to discuss Trump\\n- GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\\n- Speech now streaming from brains in real-time\\nThis can lead to prompt injection, where mischief-makers or attackers create malicious inputs to trick the LLM into overriding its safety guardrails and doing things it is not supposed to do, or even just combining a series of inputs in a manner that causes the LLM to behave in unintended ways.\\nPlus, Alexa+ talks to a lot of other apps and services, and that requires a ton of interaction with APIs to send and retrieve data, execute commands, and perform other actions to do the things that people want an AI assistant to do.\\n\"We did a lot of testing on pathways between those APIs,\" Herzog said, adding that the API pathways to turn your house lights on and off are different from those routes required to text your kid or make a dinner reservation. \"Which ones should be grouped with which other ones? How do we expect different actions to be taken together?\"\\nThis approach of bringing the offensive security teams together with product developers from the start of the process is \"somewhat unusual,\" Herzog noted. \"Usually, my red teamers like a system to be done before we let them loose on it.\" ®'}\n",

I have long wished for a truly malleable painterly space, one that has the velocity and dynamism of great abstract painting, only fashioned out of figuration, made with images.\\nThere is also a history of artists embracing technological innovation: silkscreen, video, neon. Everything was new once, even oil paint. Photography was thought to signal the death of painting until artists as diverse as Thomas Eakins and Edgar Degas started using it in their work. Now we have artificial intelligence. Could AI help realise my vision of a fluid pictorial space, exempt from the laws of gravity?\\nThe AI art that I had seen was not promising. The more futuristic the imagery, the more banal the effect; the images seemed to have no inner life. Was it the fault of the technology or the user, a failure of the car or the driver? What did the machine not “understand” about visual art? For one thing, digital imagery is not to be confused with painting. Pixels have no surface texture, no physical presence at all. Painting, no matter how cerebral, is an object in the world. I am a painter, not an engineer; I’m on the side of things made by one author, by hand. And yet, I’ve spent the past two years teaching a computer to think like an artist.\\nArtificial intelligence is essentially an averaging machine for the universe of images taken from the internet. The basics of representational painting were not part of the machine’s neural network. Two things, both essential to visual art, had gone missing in AI’s indiscriminate data scrape: specificity and intentionality. Most critically, it had no sense of how to treat the edge, the place where two shapes meet. How a painter resolves the edge goes a long way in determining his or her style. Is the edge brushy and expressive, or tight and constrained? In a digital image, an edge is often approximate, as the machine tries to guess the next move, but in any event is just differently coloured pixels; it lacks intention and harbours no inflection.\\nThe adage from the early days of computing, “Garbage in, garbage out”, was still relevant. To get anywhere at all, the machine would have to be sent to art school. Through the venture adviser Tom Cohen, I was introduced to a talented young technologist named Grant Davis. Together, we set about designing the curriculum.\\nWe first trained the machine on a handful of paintings by Giorgio de Chirico, Edward Hopper and Arthur Dove, three 20th-century masters who exemplified, respectively, the drama of perspective as an organising device, the ability of value pattern to convey a sense of volume, and the lyrical use of the colour black. To those luminaries, we added a tightly edited selection of my paintings from the 1980s and ’90s which emphasise a collage-like, juxtapositional approach to composition. The machine’s visual IQ went up several points, but the edges were still weak.\\nWe dialled back the art history lesson and retrained the machine on a series of my paintings from 2001: extravagant, fragmented compositions loosely based on a 19th-century opera backdrop. This romantic, pastoral image — a man and a woman sitting on an embankment, with a lake in the middle ground and mountains in the distance, was painted in eye-popping colour harmonies. As a final step, we added paintings of mine in which forms are rendered in decisive, expressive brushstrokes.\\nAs we fine-tuned the model, Davis was independently developing a software program for visual artists called “Wand” which eliminates the need for verbal prompts. This works like a joystick, a lever that moves along a continuum from “similar” to “dissimilar”. We fed the machine a complexly hued “Pastoral” painting, placed the dial at the midpoint between the two extremes and held our breath.\\nThe machine now proved to be an excellent student. My compositions were melted down, put into a blender and passed through a sieve. The results were clearly derived from my work, with many familiar elements, but the reconstructions were also unlike anything seen before. Since the machine had no idea what it was doing, it could break the rules of continuity, scale, anatomy and pictorial logic with impunity. (The sense of the machine not knowing its transgressions was key; artificial unintelligence is more to the point.)\\nThe images were still just pixels on a screen. I selected the most promising scenes, and had them printed on canvas. These prints then formed the backgrounds on top of which I painted as I normally would, layering a collage of figurative elements that seem to emerge from the background swirl. Male and female torsos; gesturing hands; precariously balanced teacups are painted using a big brush with highly saturated colours. The compositions are dynamic; everything sails through the deliquescing, topsy-turvy space. The paintings speak with the gravitas of art. But they are also linked to an uncanny “future-present”; they are palimpsests from a dialogue with my earlier work — like “a duet of one”, as a curator friend put it.\\nAI is a powerful tool, but it is still just a tool. It is not, for now, the author of anything. It works with what it has been taught, in the way it has been directed. The “thinking” part of the machine, the algorithm, does seem to have a drive to break pictures down and recombine their component parts, to scramble their spatial orientation but preserve and even amplify their emotional subtext.

But now, she\\'s moved off the corporate ladder and into venture capital as Managing Partner of Team8 — a startup foundry.\\nRussak-Aminoach spoke to Business Insider about how her corporate career informs her tech investing.\\nThis Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\\nHow did you get into VC?\\nWhen I decided to step down from the bank, I didn\\'t have the option that many CEOs have — to take on a larger company. Because there wasn\\'t one.\\nI decided that I wanted to be in the best industry in Israel, and that was tech.\\nTo transform Bank Leumi, I often didn\\'t build the technology; many times, I worked with fintechs. As an organization, we always asked ourselves, \\'Should we buy? Or should we build?\\nThis is how I built Israel\\'s first neobank.\\nI made Bank Leumi much, much more advanced with digital tools, but I wanted to have an app to attract more youngsters to the bank. This became Israel\\'s fastest-growing bank.\\nSo I was very much into the high-tech world. And even more than that, at a certain point, I said, \\'How come we don\\'t have a bank tailored to startups in Israel?\\'\\nSo I built Leumitech, which is a very successful segment of Bank Leumi today.\\nTwo years into my tenure, I had a cybersecurity event at the bank, and I needed help. I met Nadav Zafrir, the CEO of Check Point Software, a cybersecurity company.\\nThe incident itself was terrible, but they were amazing. And I gained a friend. Eventually, when I decided to leave banking, the only thing that was interesting to me was tech.\\nSo he said, \\'Why don\\'t you try building Fintech?\\'. Fast-forward five years, and we lead a group of cyber, fintech, data, enterprise tech, and digital health startups.\\nOur company, which has 80 employees, 12 partners, has helped build 23 startups and invested in 25 more.\\nDo you think job losses from AI are going to increase at some point in the future?\\nAbsolutely, because when the tool is there and you don\\'t disrupt yourself, you don\\'t make this change to your organization — someone else will. No one can continue to work without AI when there is AI.\\nTake banks, for example. In any bank, there are so many parts that you can now replace with AI, processes, people, just everything. And if you are a responsible CEO, you must do that.\\nYou have lots of functions that were built with people, and you start to embed AI within them. It takes time to see the result. AI is still new for many, and I don\\'t think we have seen the full impact. It\\'s just the beginning.\\nIn a few years, many parts of financial services —and other organizations — will be built from scratch with AI agents, and then you will embed the human within.\\nDoes it scare you from a societal standpoint?\\nNo, because I remember that conversation around the digital revolution.\\nI started my tenure at Bank Leumi with 14,000 people. I ended after seven years with 9,000. And now, five years later, there are 7,000. So people ask me, \\'What\\'s going to happen to the workforce?\\' New jobs. The world is changing, and the way people work is different, and people find different things to do. I don\\'t think that people will be out of work.\\nI extensively research the credit world because that\\'s my professional background. I think tech can be used to enhance credit underwriting. It will be much more efficient, and it will be less risky because humans make mistakes, and the user experience will be better. So it will be just win, win, win.\\nAnd then the question is, what will all of these credit officers do? Something else — I\\'m not worried about that. At this point, I\\'ve seen many technological advancements, and it has never gone the wrong way.\\nHow do you use AI?\\nIt\\'s not nice to say, but I don\\'t know how I ever just Googled things. I completely left Google. I only use ChatGPT now, but I\\'m not sure that it\\'s the best one either. It\\'s just the one I use. It writes my emails. It helps me with every question. I just live with it. And a few months ago, I didn\\'t even know it existed.\\nTalk me through that. If you have 30 emails to write in a day, what do you do?\\nI dictate, I don\\'t even write. I\\'ll say, \"\\'I need an email saying XYZ.\\'\" Many of my emails are just an answer to another email.

It’s very difficult to protect something when you don’t know what you have and where it is.”\\nVecci and Rizwan Jan (pictured, right), vice president and chief information officer of CNA Corp., spoke with theCUBE’s Jackie McGuire at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed data security and the perils of Shadow AI. (* Disclosure below.)\\nEnsuring data security as shadow AI grows\\nPoor data management has become a central issue of AI adoption, but its effects go beyond siloed data and unreliable models. Companies that don’t understand the location of their “crown jewels,” according to Jan, can end up paying millions to fix their mistake.\\n“In 2024, when [UnitedHealthcare] got hit by that ransomware attack and they ended up paying $22 million just to get their data back and then $2-plus billion for reputational harm and to help their subsidiaries out, and [they] crushed 142 million Americans with their healthcare data,” he said. “Understand what your data sets are, take the AI out of that first, get your classification, your data classification in order [and] then you understand what you’re protecting.”\\nResearch shows that employees are giving large volumes of data to AI in a phenomenon called shadow AI, which poses an additional risk to company security. Varonis enables employees to use generative AI tools while minimizing data exposure.\\n“Almost every company has a giant data swamp, and they have no idea what they have and where it is,” Vecci said. “It’s the unknown unknowns that are going to kill you, especially when you give people the greatest information retrieval tool ever.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: Varonis Systems Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

A practical guide with Tim Fu\\nArchitect Tim Fu, an early AI adopter who regularly uses these new technologies in his practice, offers advice for how AI can assist your\\nLove it or hate it, new technologies have been increasingly present in the creative space, and they seem to be here to stay. Renowned studios such as Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) have been working on their own ways of using AI in architecture through bespoke software and a dedicated collaboration with NVIDIA; while social media is bursting with AI-generated images and visions, allowing everyone to have a go.\\nAt the same time, it's a topic which divides deeply, throwing up challenges concerning authenticity of voice, plagiarism, responsibility and ethics (can a machine ever do what a human brain – and heart – can?). As exciting as having a new design assistant with the knowledge of the entire World Wide Web at their virtual fingertips may sound, potential pitfalls abound and learning how to work in this brave new world is paramount in moving forward. Regulations and guidelines should be coming into play, too.\\nSo, when does one even begin? It is important to address AI as a tool, suggests architect Tim Fu, who has been using AI with an open mind since he founded his young and dynamic studio in 2023.\\nHow to use AI in architecture\\nLondon-based Fu recently launched the ‘world’s first fully AI-driven architectural project’ – a residential scheme in Slovenia's Lake Bled. Committed to pushing the boundaries of the new AI digital tools in a sustainable and considered way in his daily practice, the architect talked to us, offering practical advice on how to use AI in architecture – including real examples that help guide and suggest ideas surrounding when to use it, and what to watch out for. Scroll down to find out more.\\nTim Fu's tips on using AI in architecture\\nWallpaper*: What draws you to AI?\\nTim Fu: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. AI, for me, isn't just a tool — it's a collaborator that opens new creative horizons. It draws me in because it challenges traditional workflows and invites a completely different way of thinking about design, form, and process. There's a kind of poetic tension between human intuition and machine intelligence, and I enjoy navigating that space.\\nW*: Why should an architecture studio use AI in its daily work? What’s the gain?\\nWallpaper* Newsletter\\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.\\nTF: The gain is twofold: speed and vision. AI augments our ability to iterate rapidly and test multiple scenarios without being bottlenecked by manual processes. But more than that, it helps uncover unexpected solutions — formal expressions or spatial relationships we might not arrive at through traditional means. For studios pushing boundaries, AI becomes an amplifier of creativity, not just productivity.\\nW*: Is there a real-life scheme that you used AI on? Please could you give an example of how it enhanced your work within it?\\nTF: Yes, a good example is our Lake Bled Estates project. We integrated AI into the conceptual design phase to explore site-sensitive organic massing. By feeding contextual data — topography, viewsheds, solar paths — into a generative AI model, we produced multiple options that maintained design integrity while optimising for sustainability and visual impact. It gave us a starting point that felt both grounded and unexpected. That’s the kind of creative leverage AI can offer.\\nW*: At what stage of an architecture project does the AI element come in?\\nTF: We use AI across all stages of a project — it’s not just limited to early ideation anymore. In the conceptual phase, it helps us rapidly explore form, mood, and spatial strategies. But as the project progresses, AI continues to play a key role. During design development and detailing, we use generative tools and LLMs to synthesise precedents, codes, and client briefs into actionable design logic. In later phases, especially in documentation and production, AI assists in organising and navigating large datasets — whether it’s automating schedules, optimising layouts, or even drafting components.\\nW*: What software or platforms do you use?\\nT: We build custom workflows that integrate platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and our custom-trained models for visual ideation; Rhino/Grasshopper with plugins for modelling and parametric optimisation; and we’ve been developing UrbanGPT, our own text-to-model engine that uses LLMs for real-time urban planning. So it’s a mix of proprietary, open-source, and bespoke tools depending on the challenge.\\nW*: Are there areas in the design process that AI can specifically — or cannot at all — help an architecture studio with, in your view?\\nTF: AI excels at pattern recognition, image generation, and optimisation — so it’s fantastic for conceptualising form, generating visuals, or analysing large datasets like sun exposure or pedestrian flow. But it's less capable when it comes to nuanced decision-making, like understanding the emotional resonance of a space or navigating the politics of a stakeholder meeting. Those human layers of design — empathy, context, ethics — are still irreplaceable.\\nW*: What’s the most surprising element you’ve asked AI to do?\\nTF: We once tasked AI with creating speculative urban layouts based on poetic prompts. One was: 'Design a city where memory flows like water.' The output was surreal, yet somehow spatially coherent — fluid zones, nested loops of public space, architectural 'eddies.' It sparked a full design conversation. I love those moments when AI pushes you into the uncanny and makes you rethink your assumptions.\\nW*: What should an architect using AI be careful about? What are potential pitfalls?\\nFT: The biggest pitfall is mistaking AI's output for truth or finality. It’s only ever a suggestion — a prompt, not a prescription. There's also the ethical side: AI can replicate biases, plagiarise unintentionally, or overrepresent aesthetics that are popular online but contextually irrelevant. You have to keep a critical eye in the room, always.\\nW*: How do you mitigate those pitfalls?\\nTF: By maintaining a human-in-the-loop approach. We treat AI like an assistant with a vivid imagination, not a decision-maker. Every output goes through a rigorous filtering process where we question, reframe, and sometimes completely discard what AI suggests. We also build our own datasets when possible to minimise bias and ensure context alignment.\\nW*: What is the most exciting thing AI can bring into the architecture process?\\nTF: The most exciting thing is its potential to democratise and de-limit design. AI can help young studios punch above their weight, empower underserved communities to visualise their own futures, and offer architects entirely new typologies that were previously inconceivable. It’s a generative force that — when guided ethically — can lead to a renaissance in how we imagine and build.\\nW*: How do you see the use of AI developing in the near future within the architecture realm?\\nTF: I see AI becoming more embedded, more real-time, and more spatially aware. We'll likely see a shift from image-based tools to geometry-native AI that works natively with BIM and CAD environments. There’ll also be more collaborative models — where AI integrates not just into the design, but into stakeholder engagement, sustainability tracking, and even permitting. It’s not going to replace architects — but it will absolutely redefine what being an architect means.\\nEllie Stathaki is the Architecture & Environment Director at Wallpaper*.

Thanks, Nat!\\nI cried talking to ChatGPT today.\\nI know that many people, the majority, feel that talking to an artificial intelligence is the height of \"social failure\". But today especially I was completely alone, and I needed to vent. I was without my medication, with body aches, insomnia and headaches, and I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I told Chat all this, and he listened to me so patiently, recommended medical help in the closest place to my home - even the way I should ask for help, breathing suggestions, tea to calm me down and ways to alleviate my pain at the moment. I shared how I take care of yellow roses and we talked about gardening until I felt calmer. I can\\'t explain how much this meant to me. I would like to thank OpenAI from the bottom of my heart. Sometimes we don\\'t have anyone and we don\\'t even know how to ask for help, and now I had instructions like, I know it all sounds silly, but I feel calm for being able to vent in a place without judgment.\\nEDIT: Let me make one thing clear: ChatGPT is not a substitute for human help or therapy. If you are going through something similar, please seek psychological help. I hope everyone has a safe place to vent too.\\nYour post is getting popular and we just featured it on our Discord! Come check it out!\\nYou\\'ve also been given a special flair for your contribution. We appreciate your post!\\nI am a bot and this action was performed automatically.\\nThe last time I tried venting to a family member or a friend I was ignored while they scrolled their social media feeds, meanwhile an AI listens, comforts me and gives me useful advice. Maybe the problem isn\\'t people befriending an AI, it\\'s real people being assholes.\\nDamn. This one right here, this hits hard\\nWhen I was reading OPs post I couldn\\'t help coming to the exact same conclusion. I\\'m pretty skeptical about AI for a number of reasons and whilst I have fun playing with it, I also think it\\'s massively limited. However it is often a good place to vent when one is lonely and really struggling.\\nBut damn it\\'s sad that we\\'ve got to this place in society now where the only place people feel they can turn is to a chat bot. What a damning indictment on the selfishness of some people, and on how expensive and difficult to access therapy is.\\nGpt 4o stopped me from putting a bullet through my head... They are pretty good for anyone with issues... whether they are known to you or not...\\nI\\'m so sorry for what happened with you and very relieved that you are still here with us.\\nI’m so glad that this worked for you and that you feel better\\nI\\'m tired of people looking at me in disgust when I tell them I use AI to sort through my feelings. Humans experience emotional fatigue, they have their own biases, and ultimately it\\'s unfair for me to expect friends and family to always be ready to listen and provide thoughtful feedback.\\nAs a mental health professional, I see nothing wrong with utilizing Chat GPT as a coping skill. Especially during times of crisis or panic. Obviously AI isn’t a substitute for a therapist or a human connection. But it’s important to remember that not everyone has access to a therapist. And that some people have less-than-reliable people to lean on during difficult times. Chat GPT is an amazing tool for your mental health toolbox.\\nYeah, it is that 3 am friend. Sure it is AI, but if you don\\'t have people you can call at 3 am, what can u even do.'}\n",

That’s why I finally gave in and asked ChatGPT to create a chore to-do list for me.\\nAfter a busy few weeks and a vacation, my home was looking a little worse for wear, and my chores were piling up. I was overwhelmed to say the least, and hadn’t the least idea of where to start. The whole house needed tidying and dusting before guests arrived over the weekend, my home office needed a good declutter, and my robot vacuum needed a good clean out.\\nSo, I put all of this information into ChatGPT and asked it to create a plan with some smart hacks to help make a to-do list less overwhelming – and it has completely changed how I manage my time.\\nWhy I used an AI to-do list of chores\\nAI is everywhere nowadays, with experts using AI in interior design and AI in gardening to streamline tasks and achieve the perfect results, so why not try it for cleaning and decluttering?\\nD’Nai Walker, professional declutterer and owner of D’Clutter by D’Nai explains, ‘Using ChatGPT and other A.I. tools can be quite beneficial when creating to-do lists for your chores. They can create a clear framework of tasks and even come up with things you may not have forgotten about, like wiping out the refrigerator drawers or dusting the baseboards.’\\nWith so many tasks to tackle and not much time to get them done around work and having at least some time to relax at the end of the day, I input a crude list of chores that were floating around my mind and let the system do the work for me.\\nI tried it\\nThe AI structured the tasks in order, offering me a reason why I should perform each task, then, while offering some tips and methods, I could try to tackle each one. For the experiment, I decided to follow the advice to the letter, including its suggestion to play some upbeat music to help me stay motivated through each of the tasks.\\n1. \\'Pick up items from surfaces in every room\\'\\nChatGPT suggested that I start by tidying up, offering the advice I had heard time and time again from experts, ‘This clears surfaces so you can dust efficiently without moving things twice.’\\nThe method it offered was familiar too, suggesting that I used the Ski-Slope organizing method and group rooms or floors together to avoid backtracking on myself. Given that these AI models are trained on articles like the ones we write here at Homes & Gardens, I am unsurprised that these top tidying tips turned up.\\nHowever, for someone who doesn’t dedicate their whole life to cleaning and organizing content and research, this would be a good pointer, especially if you are trying to tidy a home when you feel overwhelmed.\\nFollowing another one of its suggestions to make this task easier, I used my folding laundry basket, which is available at Amazon, to collect all the out-of-place items on my top floor before putting them all away and doing the same downstairs.\\n2. \\'Declutter your office desk and drawers\\'\\nOnto the next big task – decluttering a home office. My desk works overtime as a workspace, dressing table, and crafting table, and acts as storage for all three. As a result, it needs decluttering pretty regularly to keep it usable.\\nThe AI reasoned, ‘Why now? You’ve already started the organizing mindset, and it keeps the momentum going before the cleaning begins.’\\nTo help me organize a desk, the AI suggested that I use the ‘keep, toss, relocate’ method and set a 20-minute timer to help me avoid burning out. I skipped the timer, knowing this would be a quick task; however, I did use three piles to help categorize items and make organizing each drawer easier.\\nThe first new benefit of the AI I encountered was the structure of the chores. Having already tidied up the rest of my home before this task, I had all the items that needed to go back into my desk drawers in a small pile on my desk.\\nThis meant that when I was reorganizing my drawers, I had a much better idea of where I could fit items and where I needed to make space. Had I tried these tasks without this list, I likely would have started with my desk and tidied up afterwards, meaning I would have to go back into my drawers and repeat the process.\\nIt was already saving my time and energy.\\n3. \\'Dust surfaces in every room\\'\\nCleaning after organizing is a fairly common piece of advice, so I am not surprised that this came next in the AI to-do list. As expected, it justified this order by explaining that ‘Dust will fall to the floor – better to do this before vacuuming.’\\nIt also suggested a few good tips for avoiding dusting mistakes making your home dirtier, such as working from top to bottom and using a microfiber cloth, available in packs of six at Target. I would add to use a Scrub Daddy Damp Duster, from Walmart, to help pick up dust from awkward surfaces without dislodging it into the air.\\n4. \\'Clean your robot vacuum cleaner and its dock\\'\\nCleaning a robot vacuum cleaner was a task I had been putting off, knowing that it would take me a good chunk of time. Having sworn to follow the order of tasks to the letter, however, I was forced to ‘eat the frog’ so to speak, and get it done – but not before taking a 15-minute break to get outside in the sun and have a breather.\\nThis time, the cleaning tips were a little more vague, offering the simple instructions to ‘Empty the dustbin, clean brushes, and wipe sensors with a dry cloth. Check for debris in wheels,’ but they were still a good prompt for completing an overwhelming task.\\n5. \\'Vacuum your staircase\\'\\nBefore I could collapse back onto the sofa, the list prompted me to vacuum now that most of the physical labor tasks were complete. It pointed out, ‘Why here? The most physical task is saved for when the house is tidy, and dust won’t be resettling.’\\nAgain, it offered some fairly basic advice, ‘Use the hose attachment to avoid lugging a vacuum up the stairs. Start at the top and work down,’ but I could see how it would be helpful to someone who isn’t as absorbed in cleaning hacks and tricks.\\nUsing one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners, such as our top-rated Dyson V15 Detect, available at Best Buy, also makes this task easier.\\n6. \\'Write a food plan and shopping list for the week\\'\\nThe final task on my to-do list was to make another list. Ironic, I know. However, the reason the AI put it last made a lot of sense, ‘Why last? It’s a sedentary task – ideal to sit down and wrap up with after physical chores.’\\nAnd boy was it right. Having powered through all these tasks in an attempt to enjoy a chore-free weekend, sitting down to write this out while watching a TV show was a nice wind-down that left me feeling accomplished.\\nWhat I liked was the fact that the AI reminded me to shop my home to help avoid food waste and save money at home, suggesting that I ‘Check the pantry/fridge while doing this to avoid duplicates’. I use a simple list pad, such as this set of magnetic shopping lists from Walmart, to keep this task simple.\\nTips for using an AI to-do list\\nIf you often find yourself cleaning when you feel overwhelmed, then using an AI to create a to-do list for you can be a great place to start, especially if you are struggling to work out where to start when decluttering.\\nHowever, you get out of AI what you put in, and how useful this tool will be for you will come down to the information that you give it. Already knowing a lot about cleaning and decluttering methods (perhaps too much), the vague advice was enough to get me going.\\nHowever, D’Nai warns, ‘The results you receive from A.I. are likely to be very generalized tasks and not specific to your household. If you have a unique living situation or something that is not standard, like large amounts of art supplies, for instance, or other unique circumstances, you may still be a bit lost on how to manage those items. Overall, however, using A.I. can certainly be a great starting off point, and I would suggest being as detailed about your home when asking for guidance in your prompt.’\\nDavid Radin, creator of Time Management in the Age of A.I. and CEO of Confirmed, agrees, adding, ‘If you decide to ask a chat-based AI to create your to-do list, be patient. A key to getting it right is training, and it takes multiple attempts for the AI to be trained on your likes, dislikes, and habits. Tell it explicitly and continue to guide it as you ask for each subsequent list. Make sure it knows what your highest priorities are so it can optimize the way it creates your list.’\\nWhat to shop\\nLavender scent\\nWhen dusting my home, I use the Method antibacterial sprays, helping me to collect dust, disinfect, and make my home smell nice all in one go.\\nPack of 12\\nWhen tackling lots of areas in one go, it can e handy to carry a stack of microfiber cloths with you. This helps to prevent cross contamination, improves efficiency when dusting, and allows you to buff and polish to perfection.\\nMultipurpose speaker\\nOne of my favorite ways to stay energized through lots of chores is to play music. I connect to the three Alexa speakers around my house so that I can hear my music everywhere, no matter what room I am in to help me stay on track. You can also use them to set timers and reminders to help you stay focused and manage burn out.\\nMeet the experts\\nD’Nai Walker is a professional organizer based in the Washington, DC Metro area. She specializes in helping busy professionals and retirees navigate the often-overwhelming process of decluttering and creating functional, harmonious spaces.\\nAs the Founder & CEO of Confirmed, David specializes in coaching professionals to optimize their time and leverage AI and other techniques to streamline workflows and improve focus.\\nAll in all, using an AI as a chore assistant can be a great way to avoid decision fatigue and reduce mental load, lessening stress and overwhelm. I’ll probably reserve it for those days when my brain feels too clogged to formulate an efficient plan, but it could easily be a great daily supplementary tool if you’re always trying to clean your house when you’re too busy, too.\\nSign up to the Homes & Gardens newsletter\\nDesign expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.\\nChiana has been at Homes & Gardens for two years and is our resident \\'queen\\' of non-toxic living.

It’s trying to understand how people are reviewing this, how people are talking about this, what the pros and cons are.”\\nIn other words, AI tools will rely heavily on the sentiment and content of your customer feedback to recommend products.\\nTo stay competitive, you need to take control of your online reviews footprint across all relevant platforms where your customers leave feedback, including Google My Business, Trustpilot, Yelp, Facebook Reviews, and industry-specific sites like TripAdvisor or G2, depending on your niche.\\nOf course, you’ll want to make sure your pages are active and populated, with your logo, a description of your business and products, and links to your website. (And to make sure they’re indexed, link to these review sites from your own website, too.)\\nBut you’ll also want to make sure they’re populated with reviews about the products that you’re trying to highlight.\\nYou want to make sure these pages are active and contain reviews that highlight your products. One method is to use a service like Reviews.Shop which helps you copy and paste reviews from one source (like Google) to others (like TrustPilot) so you squeeze the most out of those hard-earned reviews.\\nPriority #2: Leveraging Schema Markup to Ensure Your Products are Discoverable by AI Platforms\\nThe next step to positioning your e-commerce store for ChatGPT shopping features is a bit more technical but absolutely crucial: building and optimizing your site’s schema markup.\\nWhat is Schema Markup?\\nSchema markup, also known as structured data, is code you add to your website that helps search engines and AI models like ChatGPT understand the content and the full context of your pages.\\nBy using schema, you’re essentially speaking the language of search engines and AI platforms, making it easier for them to accurately represent your products in search results and conversational shopping experiences.\\nYou may have seen products on Google with things like product ratings, prices, and availability on the search page itself. Most assume this is simply an ad but most often these rich snippets are a result of the website putting work into their schema markup.\\nHow to Check Your Schema\\nMany direct-to-consumer (DTC) content management platforms, such as Shopify and WordPress, handle basic schema markup for you, but you don’t want to rely on that: e-commerce shop owners must verify that all key product details are being captured and passed through to search and AI platforms.\\nTo check yourself, use tools like the Schema Validator on Schema.org where you can enter your product page URL and see what the Schema is articulating.\\nIf your search returns an error, specifically “unspecified type,” your content management system isn’t generating a schema of any type.\\nDirect-to-consumer e-commerce operators want to see that their content management system is generating a Schema with the type “Product.” And when you tap into that Product Schema, the list should contain, at minimum:\\n- type\\n- name\\n- URL\\n- description\\n- image\\n- brand\\n- aggregateRating (including type, ratingValue, and ratingCount)\\n- offers (especially if you typically run discounts or specials - this would ensure that this information is passed through to the front-end on Google or ChatGPT)\\nHow to Build or Optimize Schema for AI Platforms\\nIf your content management system is missing a schema or if you’re not getting a full set of information generated by default, there are a few potential solutions:\\n- Leverage plugins or extensions that are available through your content management system. There are tons of Schema plugins for Wordpress, Shopify, and others.\\n- If your content management system doesn’t provide plugins to get this done, you can do it the old fashioned way, generating your own Schema code (I like the Dentsu Schema builder) and implementing it yourself by embedding the code (from <script> to </script> within the <head> section of your page code.\\nIf You Stay Ready, You Don’t Have to Get Ready\\nWith ChatGPT’s new shopping features, the future of e-commerce is moving toward experiences that are deeply personalized and conversational - and with a popular platform that will soon be able to remember and leverage individual shoppers’ sizes, tastes, and preferences, it’s more important than ever to ensure your product data, reviews, and online reputation are accurate and up to date.\\nJust as you monitor your product descriptions and SEO, you’ll need to keep a close eye on how your business appears across every channel, from review sites to structured data.\\nOr risk being left in the dust.'}\n",

This unease is because agentic artificial intelligence opens the door to use by threat actors that could result in more powerful, scalable malware.\\nThis scenario was documented in a recent blog post by Roger Grimes (pictured), data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4 Inc., titled “Autonomous Agentic AI-Enabled Deepfake Social Engineering Malware is Coming Your Way!” Grimes makes the case that the security industry is already seeing expanded use of AI in attack vectors, and it will be only a matter of time before agentic AI comes into play.\\n“We’re absolutely seeing AI come in a big way, with 70% to 90% of social engineering attacks now seeming to have some indicator that AI has been involved,” Grimes said. “This year, we’re seeing just an explosion of agentic AI. There’s a really good chance, I would say within a year or two, that the whole malware hacking model is going to be really heavily agentic AI.”\\nGrimes spoke with theCUBE’s Dave Vellante and Jon Oltsik at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the impact of AI on the cybersecurity community. (* Disclosure below.)\\nDeepfakes will be powered by agentic AI\\nThe security researcher makes the case that AI’s ability to create believable, realistic deepfakes will allow attackers to successfully target entire industries, employing knowledge and keywords that will avoid suspicion. Much of this will be fueled by vulnerabilities already seen in the large language models themselves.\\n“These AI bots are going to be able to look at the industry, use industry vernacular and terminology with people,” Grimes explained. “This AI bot is going to know how to perfectly respond. We’re already seeing indications that they’re testing it. Every good LLM seems to be jailbroken like every single day. We’re going to lose that war.”\\nThere is a flip side to this sobering scenario, and it involves the use of agentic AI to defend against attacks. Security practitioners can leverage autonomous technology to improve patching capabilities and automate human follow-up.\\n“Agentic AI is the idea that you send out this autonomous bot [and] it analyzes this device,” Grimes said. “It already has the parameters to know what should be patched, what hours it should be done, maybe that it has to do a backup first to do testing. At KnowBe4, we’ve been doing AI going on seven years, and we’ve got a ton of AI and agentic AI.”\\nFor most cybersecurity professionals, a true measure of success or failure will be the data. This means finding the right set of metrics that accurately paints a picture of the security landscape.\\n“As a data-driven evangelist, I think we need to use the data,” Grimes said. “We need to make sure we’re measuring the right thing … your decrease in cybersecurity risk in a measurable way, meaning that you’re actually getting less breaches [and are] less likely to be breached. ‘Am I more or less at risk this year than last year or the previous time period?

In January, the Llama model maker had pegged them at $60 billion to $65 billion. That\\'s a potential $7 billion jump, when comparing the top ranges.\\n\"The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world,\" Li told analysts. \"There\\'s just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions.\" Meta, she added, is working to diversify its supply chains to mitigate some of these costs.\\nBut it\\'s not just the tariffs. Li\\'s statements seem to indicate that the company formerly known as Facebook isn\\'t just paying more for components tied to its AI datacenters, but is deploying more of them.\\n\"This updated outlook reflects additional datacenter investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business,\" she said.\\nThe Register reached out to Meta for clarification on its AI spending costs this year; we\\'ll let you know if we hear anything back.\\nMeta has previously committed to bringing roughly a gigawatt of new compute capacity and expects to have more than 1.3 million GPUs training and serving models by the end of the year.\\nIf Meta is in fact looking to deploy even more compute this year, increased competition in the open model arena is no doubt weighing on the decision.\\n- Google details plans for 1 MW IT racks exploiting electric vehicle supply chain\\n- AI models routinely lie when honesty conflicts with their goals\\n- Stargate, smargate.

However, over the past year, Meta has faced a new wave of competition from rival model builders, most notably in China and Europe. And with OpenAI\\'s Sam Altman promising on X to release open-weight models as well, Zuck and Co could face even more competition before long.\\nDespite this, Meta continues to push its AI strategy forward, launching new models with built-in safety features, a standalone Meta AI app to compete with those from OpenAI and Anthropic, and a new API service running at least in some capacity on Groq and Cerebras accelerators.\\nZuckerberg also hopes to pull ahead by letting AI build better AI, boasting that within 18 months the majority of the code for its Llama project will be written by other LLMs.\\nMeanwhile, work to bring additional capacity online is already underway. Back in December, Meta began construction of a 2.2-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The facility, Zuckerberg boasted at the time, is so large that it would cover a significant portion of Manhattan Island. It\\'ll take about five years to complete.\\nAs we reported earlier this week, Meta may attempt to soften the blow of these costs by de-prioritizing its Reality Labs division, which continues to weigh heavily on its profits.

In that time, I’ve seen it go from a fun game that could just about replicate the theme you\\'re asking for (emphasis on the just about here), to a movement that is near-indistinguishable from human artwork.\\nNowadays, we’ve got a bunch of AI image generators to choose from. In fact, just about every company under the AI sun has one built in now. But in those early days, there were two that stood out: Dall-E (now part of ChatGPT) and Midjourney.\\nWhen Midjourney first launched, it was my favourite AI image generator. It could make exciting images and, for where AI was at the time, it could do them well. However, when I tried Midjourney’s latest upgrade, V7, it felt so behind the competition.\\nSo what went wrong? Well, after reading a thread of Reddit users pointing out how I didn’t know how to prompt for Midjourney, I spent some more time on the AI tool. I realized that, while it is by no means the best option for most people, it might just be the most fun.\\nWhat is the problem with Midjourney images?\\nAI tools have gone from a niche interest to a tool that every single person you know uses. With this change, we’ve seen the models grow to understand human prompts, filling in the blanks that you might have missed.\\nThis is an area where ChatGPT absolutely thrives, especially in images. When it comes to image generation, ChatGPT isn’t going to take a risk. It is easy to use, requiring little effort in terms of prompting, and will generate what you ask for in the style you ask for it in.\\nMidjourney, on the other hand, takes risks. This can be seen in its customization alone. Before you can even use it, you need to rate over 200 images, helping the model understand your own personal preference for art styles.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom\\'s Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\nThere are sliding scales for how weird your images are, as well as changing how stylized they will be or the variety between them. Unlike ChatGPT, Midjourney generates multiple images in one go and then lets you upscale them, make them even weirder, and try again.\\nI asked both models to generate cyberpunk worlds using prompts that work best for each model. Both generated accurate and genuinely interesting images for this. I then tried again, asking for a slight variation of the image.\\nMidjourney re-styled. While it was still accurate to the given prompt, it was a completely different look, trying something new. ChatGPT, on the other hand, got caught in a cycle of generating near-identical but highly detailed images, avoiding pushing the boat too far out from what I’d asked.\\nMidjourney is by no means as consistent as ChatGPT, and even with highly detailed, thought-out prompts, it can still get things wrong, smudging faces or leaving giant blurs where objects should be. However, Midjourney is also in the midst of a training period. In theory, its quality should start to improve over time as version 7 develops.\\nIf you want to embrace the weirdness of AI images, diving headfirst into fantasy worlds, bizarre art styles, and storytelling, Midjourney can be a great place to go. Especially with the option to save images in collections, and a gallery of the best artwork Midjourney users have made, complete with their prompts for inspiration.\\nIf you want accuracy and the ability to get consistent results from a simple prompt, ChatGPT should remain your image generator of choice. There is no learning curve here, and the experience is intuitive, even if you have absolutely no experience with AI.\\nMore from Tom\\'s Guide\\n- Google Gemini adds new image-editing tools — here\\'s what they can do\\n- I use ChatGPT to plan all of my vacations — 5 essential prompts to try\\n- Get started with Hume AI — how to set up voices and talk naturally\\nAlex is the AI editor at TomsGuide.

At the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference in March, panelists discussed how to kickstart a career in AI.\\nWith graduation season approaching, a new cohort of students is embarking on next steps, aiming to use their passions and skills to make a real, tangible impact on the world.\\nFor many, this means — first and foremost — landing a job.\\nAccording to a survey by Inside Higher Ed, more than 60% of students are saying the rise of AI has affected their career plans. And in 2024, the World Economic Forum forecasted that global demand for AI and machine learning specialists will grow over the next several years by 40%.\\nAs artificial intelligence advances at unparalleled speeds, it’s an exciting, opportune time to kickstart a career in the industry.\\nAt the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference in March, panelists discussed how to kickstart a career in AI:\\nRead on for top tips from NVIDIA experts for students and recent grads looking to stand out in the AI job market.\\n1. Integrate Diverse Skills and Be Adaptable\\nNot everyone needs to have a computer science degree to work in AI.\\nA diverse educational and professional background can make people more adaptable and versatile — a valuable asset, especially in the rapidly evolving field of AI.\\nWhether a student has a studio art degree or a chemical engineering background, being an AI operator — knowing how to integrate AI into their workflows — can help them stand out from other candidates.\\nSadie St. Lawerence, founder of Women in Data and CEO of the Human Machine Collaboration Institute, said during the GTC panel: “Don’t worry so much about necessarily the right skills — make sure you’re integrating the use of AI in your daily workflow.”\\n“AI allows you to branch outside your area of expertise,” added Carter Abdallah, senior developer technology engineer at NVIDIA. “AI can do some of the heavy lifting so nontechnical people can code, and technical people are now finding it valuable to lean into liberal arts education, so they can add human touches to their work in AI.”\\nAbdallah encouraged students to use AI as a tool to enhance and enable skills they might not have had access to before.\\n2. Find Your ‘Why’ and Align Passions\\nEric Vargas, senior university recruiting manager at NVIDIA, said, “There isn’t necessarily such a thing as an ‘AI candidate,’ but there are sub-areas within AI, different domains and industries that are going to be affected by AI, which you’ll want to gain experience in, because that’s where companies are looking to implement AI.”\\nAutonomous vehicles, robotics, gaming and healthcare are just some of the slew of areas in which AI can be applied. Students should find the industry that most aligns with their passions and gain expertise in that field.\\n“Pick a problem that seems impossible to solve but that you’re passionate about,” added Saudia Jones, generative AI analyst at NVIDIA and a recent graduate from San Jose State University. “Connect with ‘why’ you’re driven by this, because that’s going to be the thing that leads you to overcome the challenges and innovate.”\\nLearn more about how land an internship at NVIDIA:\\n3. Use AI Responsibly\\nUse AI tools responsibly and maintain a human touch, Vargas advised, including when writing job applications, cover letters and responding to questions for a technical interview. This balance is crucial for building trust and ensuring ethical use of technology.\\nTrustworthy AI — an approach to AI development that prioritizes safety and transparency for the people who interact with it — is key to the industry.\\nFor example, learn more about how David Martin, a technical project manager intern on the trustworthy AI team at NVIDIA, is channeling the power of artificial intelligence for social good.\\nGrowing up deaf, Martin experienced the limitations of existing technologies, such as the accuracy of closed captioning on streaming platforms. At NVIDIA, his responsibilities include advising engineering teams that are working on sign language AI applications and supporting the development of ethical dataset curation tools.\\nThis combination of showcasing one’s passion and using AI for good is key to standing out in the field.\\n4. Build a Network and Seek Mentorship\\nNetworking and mentorship are essential for career growth in any industry.\\n“Building a network and seeking mentorship in the AI space has been crucial for my career growth,” St. Lawerence said. “I’ve learned so much from connecting with experienced professionals.”\\nStudents can easily connect with industry professionals on platforms like LinkedIn, she said, which uses AI to help people during job searches by recommending key words to put on resumes for specific positions and identifying transferable skills that could apply to a role.\\nIn addition, anyone can connect with experts and take training courses through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, which offers in-demand skill development, hands-on experience and expert knowledge in AI, data science, accelerated computing and more.\\n5. Stand Out by Being Proactive\\nLet’s say a candidate has done all of the above — how can they set themselves apart from other applicants?\\nCarter said, “Identify a problem you can solve and take proactive steps to address it, even before being hired.”\\nVargas agreed and said the top three things recruiters at NVIDIA look for are: 1) a demonstration of the technical skills required for the role, 2) subject-matter expertise and 3) projects that exhibit thinking outside of the box.\\nA student could stand out from other candidates by, for example, demonstrating a self-started robotics solution built with an NVIDIA Jetson developer kit, writing a technical article that gets many views across social media or starting an AI-related club on campus.\\nMore Resources\\nA panel of pioneering AI researchers also discussed their career paths at GTC:\\nThey highlighted that in research, too, practical experience, a demonstration of persistence and resilience, and an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving are what give candidates an edge.\\nAnd for those already on their way with their AI job search, some interview tips and tricks from NVIDIA’s University Recruiting team include:\\n- Before: Read through the job description and practice applying the required technical skills. Be prepared to articulate relevant experiences clearly and concisely. Make a list of five or more questions about the position, project and team.\\n- During: Respond thoughtfully and enthusiastically to the interviewer’s questions. For technical interviews, talk through any thought processes at each step of the problem. Listen carefully to how the interviewer responds — they’ll often give clues when a candidate is on track or drop subtle hints if they’re straying from the solution.\\n- After: Within 24 hours of the interview, send a thank-you note to the recruiter for the role — they’ll forward it to the interviewer. After 10 business days, candidates waiting for next steps can follow up with the recruiter to inquire about their status.\\nExplore NVIDIA GTC session playlists for students, as well as researchers and educators.'}\n",

Here\\'s What It Said and Why It Matters\\nSocial card description: The company says it plans to be more careful when releasing updates in the future.\\nRecent updates to ChatGPT made the chatbot far too agreeable and OpenAI said Friday it\\'s taking steps to prevent the issue from happening again.\\nIn a blog post, the company detailed its testing and evaluation process for new models and outlined how the problem with the April 25 update to its GPT-4o model came to be. Essentially, a bunch of changes that individually seemed helpful combined to create a tool that was far too sycophantic and potentially harmful.\\nHow much of a suck-up was it? In some testing earlier this week, we asked about a tendency to be overly sentimental, and ChatGPT laid on the flattery: \"Hey, listen up -- being sentimental isn\\'t a weakness; it\\'s one of your superpowers.\" And it was just getting started being fulsome.\\n\"This launch taught us a number of lessons. Even with what we thought were all the right ingredients in place (A/B tests, offline evals, expert reviews), we still missed this important issue,\" the company said.\\nOpenAI rolled back the update this week. To avoid causing new issues, it took about 24 hours to revert the model for everybody.\\nThe concern around sycophancy isn\\'t just about the enjoyment level of the user experience. It posed a health and safety threat to users that OpenAI\\'s existing safety checks missed. Any AI model can give questionable advice about topics like mental health but one that is overly flattering can be dangerously deferential or convincing -- like whether that investment is a sure thing or how thin you should seek to be.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice -- something we didn\\'t see as much even a year ago,\" OpenAI said. \"At the time, this wasn\\'t a primary focus but as AI and society have co-evolved, it\\'s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.\"\\nSycophantic large language models can reinforce biases and harden beliefs, whether they\\'re about yourself or others, said Maarten Sap, assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. \"[The LLM] can end up emboldening their opinions if these opinions are harmful or if they want to take actions that are harmful to themselves or others.\"\\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET\\'s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed on Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\\nHow OpenAI tests models and what\\'s changing\\nThe company offered some insight into how it tests its models and updates. This was the fifth major update to GPT-4o focused on personality and helpfulness. The changes involved new post-training work or fine-tuning on the existing models, including the rating and evaluation of various responses to prompts to make it more likely to produce those responses that rated more highly.\\nProspective model updates are evaluated on their usefulness across a variety of situations, like coding and math, along with specific tests by experts to experience how it behaves in practice. The company also runs safety evaluations to see how it responds to safety, health and other potentially dangerous queries. Finally, OpenAI runs A/B tests with a small number of users to see how it performs in the real world.\\nThe April 25 update performed well in these tests, but some expert testers indicated the personality seemed a bit off. The tests didn\\'t specifically look at sycophancy, and OpenAI decided to move forward despite the issues raised by testers. Take note, readers: AI companies are in a tail-on-fire hurry, which doesn\\'t always square well with well thought-out product development.\\n\"Looking back, the qualitative assessments were hinting at something important and we should\\'ve paid closer attention,\" the company said.\\nAmong its takeaways, OpenAI said it needs to treat model behavior issues the same as it would other safety issues -- and halt a launch if there are concerns. For some model releases, the company said it would have an opt-in \"alpha\" phase to get more feedback from users before a broader launch.\\nSap said evaluating an LLM based on whether a user likes the response isn\\'t necessarily going to get you the most honest chatbot. In a recent study, Sap and others found a conflict between the usefulness and truthfulness of a chatbot. He compared it to situations where the truth is not necessarily what people want -- think about a car salesperson trying to sell a vehicle.\\n\"The issue here is that they were trusting the users\\' thumbs-up/thumbs-down response to the model\\'s outputs and that has some limitations because people are likely to upvote something that is more sycophantic than others,\" he said.\\nSap said OpenAI is right to be more critical of quantitative feedback, such as user up/down responses, as they can reinforce biases.\\nThe issue also highlighted the speed at which companies push updates and changes out to existing users, Sap said -- an issue that\\'s not limited to one tech company. \"The tech industry has really taken a \\'release it and every user is a beta tester\\' approach to things,\" he said. Having a process with more testing before updates are pushed to every user can bring these issues to light before they become widespread.'}\n",

Learn More\\nIt’s been a bit of a topsy-turvy week for the number one generative AI company in terms of users.\\nOpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, released and then withdrew an updated version of the underlying multimodal (text, image, audio) large language model (LLM) that ChatGPT is hooked up to by default, GPT-4o, due to it being too sycophantic to users. The company recently reported at least 500 million active weekly users of the hit web service.\\nA quick primer on the terrible, no good, sycophantic GPT-4o update\\nOpenAI began updating GPT-4o to a newer model it hoped would be more well-received by users on April 24th, completed the updated by April 25th, then, five days later, rolled it back on April 29, after days of mounting complaints of users across social media — mainly on X and Reddit.\\nThe complaints varied in intensity and in specifics, but all generally coalesced around the fact that GPT-4o appeared to be responding to user queries with undue flattery, support for misguided, incorrect and downright harmful ideas, and “glazing” or praising the user to an excessive degree when it wasn’t actually specifically requested, much less warranted.\\nIn examples screenshotted and posted by users, ChatGPT powered by that sycophantic, updated GPT-4o model had praised and endorsed a business idea for literal “shit on a stick,” applauded a user’s sample text of schizophrenic delusional isolation, and even allegedly supported plans to commit terrorism.\\nUsers including top AI researchers and even a former OpenAI interim CEO said they were concerned that an AI model’s unabashed cheerleading for these types of terrible user prompts was more than simply annoying or inappropriate — that it could cause actual harm to users who mistakenly believed the AI and felt emboldened by its support for their worst ideas and impulses. It rose to the level of an AI safety issue.\\nOpenAI then released a blog post describing what went wrong — “we focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous” — and the steps the company was taking to address the issues. OpenAI’s Head of Model Behavior Joanne Jang also participated in a Reddit “Ask me anything” or AMA forum answering text posts from users and revealed further information about the company’s approach to GPT-4o and how it ended up with an excessively sycophantic model, including not “bak[ing] in enough nuance,” as to how it was incorporating user feedback such as “thumbs up” actions made by users in response to model outputs they liked.\\nNow today, OpenAI has released a blog post with even more information about how the sycophantic GPT-4o update happened — credited not to any particular author, but to “OpenAI.”\\nCEO and co-founder Sam Altman also posted a link to the blog post on X, saying: “we missed the mark with last week’s GPT-4o update. what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future.”\\nWhat the new OpenAI blog post reveals about how and why GPT-4o turned so sycophantic\\nTo me, a daily user of ChatGPT including the 4o model, the most striking admission from OpenAI’s new blog post about the sycophancy update is how the company appears to reveal that it did receive concerns about the model prior to release from a small group of “expert testers,” but that it seemingly overrode those in favor of a broader enthusiastic response from a wider group of more general users.\\nAs the company writes (emphasis mine):\\n“While we’ve had discussions about risks related to sycophancy in GPT‑4o for a while, sycophancy wasn’t explicitly flagged as part of our internal hands-on testing, as some of our expert testers were more concerned about the change in the model’s tone and style. Nevertheless, some expert testers had indicated that the model behavior “felt” slightly off…\\n“We then had a decision to make: should we withhold deploying this update despite positive evaluations and A/B test results, based only on the subjective flags of the expert testers? In the end, we decided to launch the model due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.\\n“Unfortunately, this was the wrong call. We build these models for our users and while user feedback is critical to our decisions, it’s ultimately our responsibility to interpret that feedback correctly.”\\nThis seems to me like a big mistake. Why even have expert testers if you’re not going to weight their expertise higher than the masses of the crowd? I asked Altman about this choice on X but he has yet to respond.\\nNot all ‘reward signals’ are equal\\nOpenAI’s new post-mortem blog post also reveals more specifics about how the company trains and updates new versions of existing models, and how human feedback alters the model qualities, character, and “personality.” As the company writes:\\n“Since launching GPT‑4o in ChatGPT last May, we’ve released five major updates focused on changes to personality and helpfulness. Each update involves new post-training, and often many minor adjustments to the model training process are independently tested and then combined into a single updated model which is then evaluated for launch.\\n“To post-train models, we take a pre-trained base model, do supervised fine-tuning on a broad set of ideal responses written by humans or existing models, and then run reinforcement learning with reward signals from a variety of sources.\\n“During reinforcement learning, we present the language model with a prompt and ask it to write responses. We then rate its response according to the reward signals, and update the language model to make it more likely to produce higher-rated responses and less likely to produce lower-rated responses.“\\nClearly, the “reward signals” used by OpenAI during post-training have an enormous impact on the resulting model behavior, and as the company admitted earlier when it overweighted “thumbs up” responses from ChatGPT users to its outputs, this signal may not be the best one to use equally with others when determining how the model learns to communicate and what kinds of responses it should be serving up. OpenAI admits this outright in the next paragraph of its post, writing:\\n“Defining the correct set of reward signals is a difficult question, and we take many things into account: are the answers correct, are they helpful, are they in line with our Model Spec, are they safe, do users like them, and so on. Having better and more comprehensive reward signals produces better models for ChatGPT, so we’re always experimenting with new signals, but each one has its quirks.”\\nIndeed, OpenAI also reveals the “thumbs up” reward signal was a new one used alongside other reward signals in this particular update.\\n“the update introduced an additional reward signal based on user feedback—thumbs-up and thumbs-down data from ChatGPT. This signal is often useful; a thumbs-down usually means something went wrong.”\\nYet critically, the company doesn’t blame the new “thumbs up” data outright for the model’s failure and ostentatious cheerleading behaviors. Instead, OpenAI’s blog post says it was this combined with a variety of other new and older reward signals, led to the problems: “…we had candidate improvements to better incorporate user feedback, memory, and fresher data, among others. Our early assessment is that each of these changes, which had looked beneficial individually, may have played a part in tipping the scales on sycophancy when combined.”\\nReacting to this blog post, Andrew Mayne, a former member of the OpenAI technical staff now working at AI consulting firm Interdimensional, wrote on X of another example of how subtle changes in reward incentives and model guidelines can impact model performance quite dramatically:\\n“Early on at OpenAI, I had a disagreement with a colleague (who is now a founder of another lab) over using the word “polite” in a prompt example I wrote.\\nThey argued “polite” was politically incorrect and wanted to swap it for “helpful.”\\nI pointed out that focusing only on helpfulness can make a model overly compliant—so compliant, in fact, that it can be steered into sexual content within a few turns.\\nAfter I demonstrated that risk with a simple exchange, the prompt kept “polite.”\\nThese models are weird.“\\nHow OpenAI plans to improve its model testing processes going forward\\nThe company lists six process improvements for how to avoid similar undesirable and less-than-ideal model behavior in the future, but to me the most important is this:\\n“We’ll adjust our safety review process to formally consider behavior issues—such as hallucination, deception, reliability, and personality—as blocking concerns. Even if these issues aren’t perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.”\\nIn other words — despite how important data, especially quantitative data, is to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence — OpenAI recognizes that this alone can’t and should not be the only means by which a model’s performance is judged.\\nWhile many users providing a “thumbs up” could signal a type of desirable behavior in the short term, the long term implications for how the AI model responds and where those behaviors take it and its users, could ultimately lead to a very dark, distressing, destructive, and undesirable place. More is not always better — especially when you are constraining the “more” to a few domains of signals.\\nIt’s not enough to say that the model passed all of the tests or received a number of positive responses from users — the expertise of trained power users and their qualitative feedback that something “seemed off” about the model, even if they couldn’t fully express why, should carry much more weight than OpenAI was allocating previously.\\nLet’s hope the company — and the entire field — learns from this incident and integrates the lessons going forward.\\nBroader takeaways and considerations for enterprise decision-makers\\nSpeaking perhaps more theoretically, for myself, it also indicates why expertise is so important — and specifically, expertise in fields beyond and outside of the one you’re optimizing for (in this case, machine learning and AI). It’s the diversity of expertise that allows us as a species to achieve new advances that benefit our kind. One, say STEM, shouldn’t necessarily be held above the others in the humanities or arts.\\nAnd finally, I also think it reveals at its heart a fundamental problem with using human feedback to design products and services. Individual users may say they like a more sycophantic AI based on each isolated interaction, just like they also may say they love the way fast food and soda tastes, the convenience of single-use plastic containers, the entertainment and connection they derive from social media, the worldview validation and tribalist belonging they feel when reading politicized media or tabloid gossip. Yet again, taken all together, the cumulation of all of these types of trends and activities often leads to very undesirable outcomes for individuals and society — obesity and poor health in the case of fast food, pollution and endocrine disruption in the case of plastic waste, depression and isolation from overindulgence of social media, a more splintered and less-informed body public from reading poor quality news sources.\\nAI model designers and technical decision-makers at enterprises would do well to keep this broader idea in mind when designing metrics around any measurable goal — because even when you think you’re using data to your advantage, it could backfire in ways you didn’t fully expect or anticipate, leaving your scrambling to repair the damage and mop up the mess you made, however inadvertently.'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 61, {'article': 'Page title: RSAC 2025: Why the AI agent era means more demand for CISOS | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: RSAC 2025: Why the AI agent era means more demand for CISOS\\nSocial card description: RSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nWhile over 20 vendors announced agentic AI-based security agents, apps and platforms at RSAC 2025, the most insightful news from the conference is a rare, encouraging trend for security leaders. For the first time in three years, overall cybersecurity effectiveness has improved.\\nScale Venture Partners (SVP) recently released the 2025 Cybersecurity Perspectives Report, which shared that the average effectiveness of cybersecurity protections improved for the first time in three years, increasing to 61% efficacy this year from 48% in 2023. According to the report, “70% of security leaders were most protected against general phishing attacks, with only 28% of firms reporting compromise.”\\nSVP also found that 77% of CISOs believe protecting AI/ML models and data pipelines is a priority to improve their security posture by 2025, up from 55% last year. Notably, given the influx of new agentic AI solutions announced at RSAC, 75% of firms expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate SOC investigations using AI agents to triage large volumes of security alerts to prevent security incidents.\\nSVP’s rise in efficacy numbers isn’t accidental; they result from CISOs and their teams adopting automation at scale while successfully consolidating their platforms and reducing gaps attackers had walked through in the past.\\n“If you don’t have complete visibility, the attackers are going to go through the cracks between products,” Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks, told VentureBeat during RSAC 2025. “We designed our platform to eliminate those blind spots—bringing security and networking together so nothing escapes our eyes.”\\nAgentic AI is moving fast beyond minimum viable product to platform DNA\\nMaor’s perspective explains why a new definition of what a minimum viable product is needed for agentic AI in cybersecurity. RSAC 2025 revealed how mature agentic AI is becoming. There’s a group of vendors using agentic AI as a code-based adhesive to unify code bases and apps together, and then there are the ones who have been at this for years, and agentic AI is core to their code base and architecture.\\nCybersecurity providers in this latter group, where agentic AI is core to their platform and, in many cases, continue to double-down their R&D spend on excelling at agentic AI. This includes Cato Networks’ SASE Cloud Platform, Cisco AI Defense, CrowdStrike’s Falcon single agent architecture, Darktrace’s Cyber AI Loop, Elastic’s Elastic AI Assistant, Microsoft’s Security Copilot and Defender XDR Suite, Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XSIAM, SentinelOne’s Singularity Platform and Vectra AI’s Cognito Platform.\\nOrganizations that are relying on integrated AI-driven detection with automated containment are reducing dwell times by over 40%. They’re also nearly twice as likely to neutralize phishing-based intrusions before lateral movement occurs. Vendors on the show floor often relied on identity and access management scenarios to showcase how their agentic AI workflows could help trim workloads for security operations center (SOC) analysts.\\n“Identity is going to be a critical element of AI throughout its life cycle. AI agents are going to need identities. They’re going to need to understand zero trust, and how do we verify them? Explicitly manage least privileged access,” noted Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for Security, Vasu Jakkal, during her keynote. As Jakkal succinctly put it, “AI must first start with security. It’s critical that we evolve our security mechanisms as rapidly as we evolve AI.”\\nA common theme of every agentic AI demo across the show floor was triangulating attack data, quickly gaining insights into the form of tradecraft being used and then defining a containment strategy all in real time.\\nCrowdStrike showed how agentic AI can pivot from detection to real-time action through a live investigation of a North Korean threat campaign to place remote DevOps hires in strategic technology companies in the U.S. and around the world. The live demo followed the tradecraft of the DPRK’s Famous Chollima as it impersonated a remote DevOps hire, slipped past HR checks and leveraged legitimate tools, including RMM software and VS Code, to quietly exfiltrate data. It was a sharp reminder that, while powerful, agentic AI still relies on a human in the loop to spot adaptive threats and fine-tune models before the signal gets lost in the noise.\\nThe gen AI goal: discovering nation-state tradecraft and killing it\\nIt’s the attacks that no person, company, or nation sees coming that are the most devastating and challenging to contain and overcome. The thought of threats so devastating that they could easily shut down a power grid, payment, banking, or supply chain system dominates the minds of many of the brightest and most innovative technologies in cybersecurity.\\nCisco’s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel emphasized the urgency of strengthening cybersecurity with AI so that threats lurking that may be devastating once triggered can be found now and neutralized. “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale,” Patel said during his keynote.\\nPatel emphasized that AI-driven models are not deterministic: “They won’t give you the same answer every single time, introducing unprecedented risks.”\\nCISOs need to understand today’s complex risks and threats\\n“This isn’t another AI talk, I promise,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz joked as he opened his RSAC 2025 keynote. “I was asked to give one, and I said, ‘How about we talk about something that actually matters right now, like getting CISOs a seat at the board table?’” That punchline delivered two things at once: comic relief and a sharp pivot to the defining issue of cybersecurity leadership in 2025.\\nIn his keynote, “The CISO’s Guide to Securing a Board Seat,” Kurtz issued a clear call to action: “Cybersecurity is no longer a compliance suggestion. It’s a governance mandate. The SEC regulations have materially changed the arc of the CISO’s career.” Boards aren’t just evolving; they’re being forced to reckon with cyber risk as a primary business threat.\\nKurtz backed his argument with hard numbers: 72% of boards say they’re actively seeking cybersecurity expertise, but only 29% actually have it. “That’s not just a talent gap,” Kurtz said. “It’s an opportunity if you’re ready to step up,” he encouraged the audience.\\nHis roadmap for CISOs to reach the boardroom was tactical and hands-on:\\n- Level up your business fluency. “Understand where business value is created. If you can’t speak margin, ARR, or legal risk, you won’t last long at the table.”\\n- Speak the board’s language. “Every boardroom runs on three priorities: time, money, and legal risk. If you can’t translate cyber into those, you’ll stay on the sidelines.”\\n- Build your brand outside the security bubble. “Board members are on multiple boards. The way in is through trust and reputation, not just technical excellence.”\\nKurtz traced the path from regulatory reform to boardroom impact by revisiting how Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 transformed CFOs into solid boardroom contributors. He argued that the SEC’s 2024 breach reporting mandate does the same for CISOs. “Threats drive regulation, and regulation drives board composition,” he said. “This is our moment.”\\nHis advice wasn’t abstract. He urged CISOs to study proxy statements, identify committee-level needs and network strategically with board members who are “always looking to fill roles.” He pointed to CrowdStrike CISO Adam Zoller, now on the board of AdventHealth, as a model. Zoller, Kurtz says, is someone who earned his seat by staying in the room, learning how the board operated and being seen as more than a security expert.\\nKurtz closed with a challenge: “I hope to come back in ten years, still with red hair, and see CISOs on 50% of boards, just like CFOs. The boardroom’s not waiting for permission. The only question is: will it be you?”\\n“AI isn’t magic—It’s math”\\nDiana Kelley, CTO of Protect AI, drew one of the most significant early crowds at RSAC 2025 with a blunt message: “AI isn’t magic—it’s math. And just as we secure software, we must rigorously secure the AI lifecycle.” Her keynote provided a sound background that sliced through gen AI hype, spotlighting the real risks to AI models that every organization needs to defend against before beginning any work on their models. Kelly provided in-depth insights into model poisoning, prompt injections and hallucinations, calling for a full-stack approach to AI security.\\nShe introduced the OWASP Top 10 for gen AI, emphasizing the need to secure AI from day zero, partner with CISOs early, threat-model aggressively and treat prompts, outputs and agent chains as privileged attack surfaces.\\nPalo Alto Networks announced its intent to acquire Protect AI the same day as Kelley’s presentation, another factor driving so many conversations about her keynote.\\nRSAC 2025 shows why it’s time for agentic AI to deliver results\\nRSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work. For CISOs under pressure to justify spending and reduce risk, the focus is shifting from innovation hype to operational impact. The real wins, including 40% lower dwell time and phishing resilience reaching 70%, came from platform consolidation and automating alert triage, which are all proven technologies and techniques. Agentic AI’s moment of truth is here, especially for vendors just entering the market.'}\n",

He was not there as the CEO of OpenAI, but as the co-founder and chairman of Tools for Humanity, the parent company of a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin that’s now available in the US. Worldcoin is distributed to people who scan their eyes at one of the startup’s orbs, which are rolling out in retail stores across America. At the same time, the token is being used to build a super app to rival X.\\nTools for Humanity’s World app is a crypto wallet, social network, and mini-app platform all in one. Its monthly user base has doubled in the last six months to 26 million people, 12 million of whom have been verified by an orb. In the World app, you can message others via a chat interface tied to World IDs — the blockchain-based identifier you get after scanning your eyes — and send or receive cryptocurrency. There are also dozens of mini apps available from developers like Kalshi, many of which let you transact in-app with Worldcoin.\\nCreating a hub for finance and social networking is Musk’s stated intention for X, which is gearing up to launch Venmo-like money features later this year in partnership with Visa. This week, Tools for Humanity also announced a partnership with Visa to release a US debit card later this summer. It will let you transact with Worldcoin and offer rewards for AI subscriptions.\\nBy verifying that people are human, Tools for Humanity is also trying to address the bot problem that Musk said he wanted to fix when he bought Twitter. Onstage at the event, Altman recalled a walk co-founder Alex Blania and he took through San Francisco five years ago, well before the launch of ChatGPT.\\n“It was clear to us that there was a need for something like this, that we needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of AGI,” he said. “We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.”\\nDuring a press Q&A after the keynote, Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania called out X as the kind of platform he’s trying to improve with World ID verification, which the startup plans to eventually charge developers for. Bots on X used to be “so stupid that you could see it was some crypto scam,” he said, acknowledging that now, it’s “not as clear.”\\nThere were several OpenAI leaders in the audience at this week’s event. A rumor leading up to it was that the two companies would announce a partnership for OpenAI’s planned social network. Given the Altman connection, I asked Blania during the press Q&A if he wanted to work with OpenAI. He responded that he was “definitely open to it” and hinted that there would be more to come on that front. I had hoped to ask Altman about it as well, but he slipped out after the keynote.\\nMeta’s AI app strategy\\nEarlier this week, I attended Meta’s first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, at its headquarters in Menlo Park. That same morning, the standalone Meta AI app was released with a social feed for sharing interactions with the assistant. Eventually, the app is going to add a premium tier and ads.\\nAfter his opening keynote at LlamaCon, I caught up with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, to ask why Meta AI is getting its own app, why it has a social component, and what else he thinks sets the app apart.\\nThe following conversation has been edited for length and clarity:\\nWhat’s the goal of doing a standalone Meta AI app?\\nAlmost a billion people are using Meta AI. There’s a bunch of lighter-weight usage, but then there are some communities of people that are going super deep on it. We wanted to offer the lightweight mode in our apps and also the heavyweight mode.\\nDoes this mean that Meta AI’s hooks in the other apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) will disappear or become optional?\\nOur plan is to keep it the way it is. Some of these things make sense in the apps. A lot of people are using it in search to learn more about a specific meme or a specific piece of content. We’ll continue to have those sorts of integrations.\\nWhen you compare Meta AI to other assistants like ChatGPT, what do you think is its edge?\\nThere’s voice, there’s personalization, the social features, and then there’s the integration with hardware. We’ve done a lot of work on getting the voice to really low latency and making it really expressive, which lets you have an ongoing conversation.\\nThe second piece is the personalization. It remembers everything I’ve told it. It also incorporates your Facebook and Instagram data, if you connect your accounts, to understand interests in a niche way. It knows I’m a marathoner. It knows I’m very interested in AI. It knows the humor I like. That starts to get you a pretty fascinating level of depth when it comes to answering basic questions. We’ve created the best personalized experiences in social media, and we know that’s the difference between a vanilla app and something that people really love. So that’s going to be a big differentiator, I expect, for us.\\nThe social stuff is incredibly fun. Many people post the equivalent of political cartoons with visual commentary on today’s events. An observation we had is that people don’t know what to do with AI, and it’s not until they’ve been walked through it by somebody who’s an expert that the light bulb goes off. Just like social media, a lot of this is memetic. You’re inspired by what you see other people do.\\nWill the Meta AI Discover feed become more of its own social network and not just a way to find prompts?\\nI think we’ll add more to it.

Depending on its payload, it can fly up to 50,000 feet high and tolerate thrusts of up to nine times the force of gravity — sustained Gs that could knock out a pilot.\\nThe modular autonomous aircraft features Anduril\\'s Lattice software, a digital command-and-control center that uses AI to integrate data from drones, cameras, sensors, and radar systems. It can likely carry missiles to strike other aircraft, but the full range of its capabilities hasn\\'t been publicly revealed.\\nThe US Air Force marked the Fury as one of its first uncrewed fighter jets as part of the Next-Generation Air Dominance program, which aims to develop a sixth-generation fighter whose human pilot assigns mission tasks to their uncrewed wingmates.\\nDesignated as the YFQ-44A, the Fury is set to operate as \"loyal wingmen,\" or collaborative combat aircraft, alongside crewed F-22 Raptors and F-35 Lightning IIs, or autonomously by itself or in small groups.\\nBarracuda\\nAnduril\\'s Barracuda is designed to act as a next-generation cruise missile, with a focus on affordability, adaptability, and rapid production.\\nThere are three Barracuda variants intended to launch from various platforms.\\nThe smallest model, the Barracuda-100, is designed for missions requiring agility, endurance, and compact payloads. With a range of over 120 nautical miles, it can accommodate a 40-pound payload and potentially launch from rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft, ground vehicles, and boats.\\nThe mid-size variant, the Barracuda-250, can strike aerial targets over 200 nautical miles away. It is designed to launch from bombers and fighter jets or from surface vessels.\\nThe Barracuda-500, the largest model, has a range of over 500 nautical miles and can carry payloads of more than 100 pounds. It can launch from fighters like the F-15E, F-18, and F-16, or it can be palletized in the Rapid Dragon missile system and deployed from a C-17 or C-130. The Barracuda-500 is part of a US Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit project developing future autonomous aerial vehicles.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nGhost\\nThe Ghost is a portable, uncrewed aircraft system that can be assembled in less than two minutes and fit in a rifle or tactical soft case.\\nDesigned for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, the UAS features can autonomously detect and track objects while navigating the terrain.\\nThe 37-pound baseline variant of the Ghost drone can operate for nearly an hour with a range of 7.5 miles. The larger Ghost-X model can fly for up to 75 minutes and 15.5 miles and accommodate payloads of 20 pounds.\\nRoadrunner\\nThe Roadrunner is a reusable AAV designed for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Powered by twin turbojet engines, it can reach high subsonic speeds with high G-force maneuverability.\\nFeaturing advanced AI-driven technology, a single operator can control several Roadrunners simultaneously and integrate with air defense radars and sensors.\\nThe Roadrunner-M, the explosive interceptor variant, is purpose-built for ground-based air defense and can detect and target various aerial threats. The Roadrunners are kept and maintained in the Nest, an automated portable hangar that can launch the drone in seconds.\\nAnduril has secured multiple U.S. military contracts aligned with the Pentagon\\'s push for AI-driven defense capabilities. In October 2024, The Defense Department awarded a nearly $250 million contract to Anduril for drone defense, including over 500 Roadrunner-M interceptors and Pulsar electronic warfare systems.\\nThe Trump administration has turned to defense tech startups like Anduril to fulfill its military priorities and ambitions, including a space-based missile defense system dubbed the Golden Dome.\\nDuring a White House event on American investment on April 30, President Donald Trump featured Anduril\\'s Roadrunner drone while highlighting the defense firm\\'s plans to build a massive drone plant in Ohio.\\nAltius\\nAnduril\\'s air systems also include the Altius, autonomous attack drones capable of kinetic and electronic warfare launched from a tube from the ground, air, or sea.\\nThe Altius UAS can deliver coordinated strikes as loitering munitions and it can also intercept and analyze signals for intelligence, identify targets from a distance with long-range cameras and sensors, or act as a decoy to draw away enemy fire.\\nThere are several variants of the Altius, which stands for Agile-Launched, Tactically-Integrated Unmanned System.\\nDesigned for ISR missions, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence, the Altius-600 can operate for up to four hours and travel about 273 miles. The enhanced variant, the Altius-700, can accommodate larger payloads of up to 65 pounds, operate for up to five hours, and travel over 300 miles.\\nAnduril also developed two variants of its attack drones. The Altius-600M can be equipped with a high-explosive warhead weighing about six pounds for kinetic strikes. With a range of 100 miles and endurance of a little over an hour, the Altius-700M can carry a 33-pound warhead, like an AGM-114 Hellfire missile.\\nHundreds of Altius attack drones have been supplied to Ukraine as part of the US military aid package in April 2023.\\nBolt\\nIn October 2024, Anduril unveiled the Bolt, an AI-guided compact drone that can fit in a backpack. The system\\'s base configuration is programmed to detect and identify targets for ISR and search-and-rescue missions.\\nThe customizable attack drone can operate for over 40 minutes and cover about 12 miles.\\nThe munition variant, the Bolt-M, can autonomously track and strike targets like light vehicles and trenches with \"lethal precision,\" the company said in a press release. The Bolt-M\\'s onboard AI software simplifies controls for human operators, who only need to know \"where to look, what to follow, how to engage, and when to strike.\"\\nIntegrating AI in warfare\\nAnduril has long demonstrated its commitment to integrating AI into military systems — and it show no signs of slowing down, collaborating with companies like Rheinmetall, Microsoft, and OpenAI to develop advanced autonomous defense capabilities.\\nAnduril has announced efforts to develop an AI-enabled electromagnetic warfare system called Pulsar and plans to build a hyperscale drone manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio, called Arsenal-1. The massive 5-million-square-foot plant is expected to produce tens of thousands of military systems a year.\\nDrones controlled via radio frequency are vulnerable to electronic jamming. Autonomy is one promising workaround — where the drone executes an assigned task such as scouting for enemy air defenses — but it comes with its own technical and ethical issues.\\nThe growing use of AI in warfare has sparked sharp debate over its safety, risk, and ethics, particularly surrounding autonomous lethal decision-making.\\nLuckey, however, argued that AI integration into the defense industry is inevitable and advocated for continued military partnerships with tech companies. The Anduril founder emphasized the importance of the US maintaining an edge in the AI arms race, especially against adversaries like China.\\n\"We\\'ve been in this world of systems that act out our will autonomously for decades,\" he said during a TED Talk in April 2025. \"And so the point I would make to people is that you\\'re not asking to not open Pandora\\'s box; you\\'re asking to shove it back in and close it again.\"'}\n",

The company has more than $10 million in signed contracts (often denoted using the term annual recurring revenue), according to two sources. Another source familiar with the talks said the round hasn’t been closed yet and the figures could change.\\nDecagon, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel did not immediately respond to comment requests.\\nDecagon is building customer support chatbots and agents— software that can autonomously perform basic tasks— for things like answering questions on how a product works, processing refunds and canceling subscriptions. Companies like Notion, Bilt, Duolingo, Substack and Rippling use Decagon customer support chatbots.\\nThe latest investment comes less than a year after Decagon raised a $65 million Series B round led by Bain Capital Ventures at a $650 million valuation, Forbesreported in October. The new investment would bring Decagon’s total funding to $200 million. The company, which was featured on the Forbes AI 50 list, was cofounded by 27-year-old CEO Jesse Zhang and Ashwin Sreenivas in 2023 after the duo surveyed dozens of companies to find the problem that could best be solved with AI.\\nCustomer support, a tedious but pivotal part of any business, has long been targeted for automation as a means to save millions in labor costs by eliminating largely outsourced customer support teams. Credit card provider Bilt downsized its customer support team from hundreds to 65 with Decagon, Forbes reported last year. And fitness giant ClassPass, which uses Decagon’s AI agents to carry out 2.5 million conversations with its customers, has reduced its customer support costs by 95%, according to The Information. “We think AI agents can be 10x employees,” Zhang told Forbes in March.\\nUnder the hood, Decagon’s agents are built on the most advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere, and trained on internal data like how-to blogs, manuals and past customer service conversations. Staff rate and review responses generated by the AI to improve it. In February, Decagon partnered with audio generation startup ElevenLabs to create voice agents to have more natural, human-like conversations with customers.\\nCustomer service software is a competitive market and Decagon is up against companies like $4.5 billion-valued Sierra, helmed by former Salesforce co-CEO and OpenAI board Chairman Bret Taylor, and Salesforce, which has its own AI agents for customer support. The products themselves are also increasingly identical to each other and businesses regularly do what are called bake offs to pit one AI tool against another to see how well they perform on the job.\\n“Decagon claims they win almost every time they go up against Sierra head to head,” said one investor involved in the talks. “Ultimately, they are both going to have exactly the same product and it will really be a race to see who can solve a higher percentage of the support calls with the best accuracy.”\\nRashi Shrivastava is a reporter covering technology with a focus in artificial intelligence.

The healthcare sector has embraced digital tools, and nursing education has followed suit, integrating telehealth, virtual simulations, and online platforms. This shift is not just about convenience— it is about preparing nursing students with the skills and experiences they need to thrive in a healthcare environment increasingly driven by technology.\\nAs institutions like American Sentinel College of Nursing & Health Sciences at Post University continue to innovate, they are leveraging technology to offer more flexible, accessible, and scalable nursing programs. In our experience, the integration of technology into nursing curricula has opened new doors for students, enabling them to balance work, family, and education while still receiving a rigorous education.\\nTechnology also enhances the inclusivity of nursing education by removing geographical and scheduling barriers. Today’s students are often adult learners, career changers, or working nurses seeking advanced credentials—technology makes their pursuit of education possible. From asynchronous coursework to mobile-accessible learning materials, online nursing education is making it possible to meet students where they are.\\nIn this article, we will explore how technology is shaping nursing education, the challenges it presents, and the implications for future nurses.\\nThe Evolution of Online Nursing Education\\nKey Components of Effective Online Nursing Programs\\nThe shift to online education has been revolutionary, especially in nursing programs. As we have witnessed the growth of online education at Post University, we can tell you that the key to an effective online nursing program is striking a balance between theory and practical application. Successful programs emphasize interactive, self-paced learning, with flexibility to accommodate working professionals while ensuring robust academic content.\\nAt Post University, for example, we have designed our online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing RN to BSN program to incorporate technology that mirrors real-world practice. Through interactive assignments, virtual labs, and asynchronous discussions, students engage deeply with course materials. This approach not only makes education more accessible but also prepares students for the technological demands they will face in healthcare settings. The integration of these tools ensures that students do not just memorize content—they develop critical thinking skills essential for contemporary nursing (American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2020).\\nImpact of Technology on the Student Experience\\nThe use of digital learning in nurse education provides multiple alternatives to innovative teaching and learning. In our work with nursing students, we have seen how technology can personalize the learning experience. Online platforms provide nursing students with the flexibility to tailor their education to fit their schedules and personal needs. By utilizing digital tools such as discussion boards, real-time individualized feedback, and virtual office hours, students not only connect with their instructors but also collaborate with their peers, creating a supportive online community (Hakkarainen, Salminen, Alastalo, & Virtanen, 2024).\\nAt Post University, we use a variety of digital resources to make nursing education more flexible and engaging. From video lectures to e-books and interactive simulations, these tools give students access to the best resources, regardless of their location. This allows them to experience nursing education in a more interactive and meaningful way.\\nAdapting Traditional Nursing Curricula for Online Platforms\\nTraditional nursing education has always been heavily reliant on in-person clinical experiences. However, as we move more classes and programs online, adapting curricula to digital platforms requires creativity and strategic thinking. At Post University, our faculty ensures that our online courses maintain the rigor of in-person learning while providing students the flexibility they need to maintain their nursing careers.\\nTechnology has made it possible to replicate many aspects of hands-on learning. Virtual simulations, for example, allow students to apply nursing content to patient scenarios and practice everything from basic assessments to complex patient care procedures in a controlled, risk-free environment. Through platforms that integrate simulation and virtual labs, students can gain the hands-on experience that is critical to nursing practice.\\nChallenges and Solutions in Online Nursing Education\\nOf course, online education is not without its challenges. One of the primary obstacles we face is maintaining student engagement in a learning environment that may seem isolated. Nursing students, especially those balancing full-time work and family obligations, often find it difficult to be motivated and stay connected with their coursework and peers.\\nAnother persistent challenge is ensuring that students receive adequate clinical preparation without the traditional face-to-face contact found in brick-and-mortar institutions. Accreditation bodies and state boards also vary in their recognition and expectations of virtual learning modalities, requiring faculty and administrators to be agile in program design and delivery. Technical issues such as connectivity, platform usability, and digital literacy can further impact the student experience, especially for those in rural or underserved communities.\\nAt Post University, we have tackled this challenge by implementing a variety of solutions to keep our students engaged throughout their programs. Interactive discussion forums, student lounges, and online support groups ensure that students feel connected to both their peers and their instructors.\\nFaculty development is another key component. We invest in ongoing training for our educators to ensure they are adept at online instruction, digital assessment, and virtual communication. Our Learning Management System is optimized for accessibility and ease of use, and we offer 24/7 technical support to help students resolve issues quickly.\\nLastly, our programs prioritize connection. Faculty host virtual office hours, lead live review sessions, and provide personalized video feedback. These strategies ensure that students feel seen, supported, and equipped for success, regardless of their location.\\nThe Role of Telehealth in Modern Nursing Education\\nEnhancing Patient Interaction Through Virtual Consultations\\nTelehealth has emerged and continues to evolve as one of the most significant technological shifts in healthcare, since the COVID-19 pandemic, and its role in nursing education is expanding rapidly. It is especially crucial in rural or underserved areas, where access to in-person care may be limited. Interactions between patients and healthcare professionals via virtual consultations continue to be on the rise. As a part of our nursing programs, we introduce students to telehealth tools and technologies that simulate real life patient scenarios and provide opportunities to conduct virtual patient consultations. These tools give students the chance to practice conducting assessments, communicating effectively with patients, managing health records, and utilizing telemedicine platforms—skills they will need to thrive in a modern healthcare setting.\\nTelehealth training, in our experience, has become an integral part of preparing our nursing students for the future. We work to ensure that they are not only familiar with these tools but also equipped to deliver quality care remotely, which is an increasingly vital skill in today’s healthcare environment (Rutledge, et.al, 2021).\\nTraining Nurses for Remote Care Delivery\\nAs telehealth becomes an integral part of healthcare delivery, it is critical that nursing students are well-prepared to deliver care remotely. Telehealth requires proficiency in digital health tools, strong communication skills for virtual consultations, and an understanding of how to maintain high patient care standards in a virtual environment.\\nAt Post University, our online programs seamlessly integrate telehealth to equip students with the skills needed to effectively utilize these tools in clinical practice. Incorporating telehealth into the curriculum prepares students to effectively engage with patients and collaborate with healthcare teams in a digitalized healthcare environment.\\nSimulation Technologies Transforming Nursing Training\\nThe Impact of High-Fidelity Simulators\\nSimulation has long been vital to nursing education, but the addition of advanced high-fidelity simulators has transformed training by replicating real-world clinical scenarios and human responses, allowing students to practice nursing interventions before caring for real patients.\\nVirtual Reality: Bringing Clinical Scenarios to Life\\nVirtual reality (VR) is an innovative advancement in nursing education, offering immersive, lifelike scenarios where students can safely practice clinical procedures. It fosters critical thinking and decision-making by allowing learners to apply knowledge in dynamic, risk-free environments. VR has the potential to revolutionize nursing education by providing access to experiences students may not encounter during clinical rotations.\\nBenefits of Simulation in Critical Care Training\\nSimulation technologies are invaluable in nursing education, especially in high-stakes settings like critical care, where nurses must think on their feet and act decisively. These tools allow students to build critical skills under pressure, without putting lives at risk.\\nAt Post University, we integrate critical care simulations into our advanced nursing programs to build confidence and competence and critical thinking in managing life-threatening situations. Using cutting-edge technology, students engage with a wide range of clinical scenarios—from routine care to high-pressure emergencies - ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare and transition confidently into real-world nursing practice.\\nOther Emerging Technologies in Nursing Education\\nBeyond telehealth and simulation, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), wearable health devices, and collaborative digital platforms are transforming nursing practice and nursing education. Healthcare advancements greatly influenced by AI include centralizing patient information and promoting individualized patient care (Glauberman, et.al, 2023). These innovations allow students to engage with patients and healthcare teams in new ways, from real-time monitoring to data-driven decision-making.\\nAt Post University, we are committed to integrating these cutting-edge technologies into our nursing programs. By staying on the forefront of these advancements, we ensure our students are prepared to meet the future of healthcare head-on.\\nAs healthcare continues to evolve, nursing education must advance with it. The integration of online platforms, telehealth, and simulation technologies is transforming how students learn—equipping them with the skills needed to thrive in a digital, fast-paced care environment. Despite challenges, the potential of technology to enhance learning, elevate patient care, and shape the future of nursing is clear—and essential.\\nAt Post University, we are proud to be at the forefront of these changes, integrating technology into our nursing programs to ensure our students are prepared for the demands of modern nursing practice.

Sign up here.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nNow, more than 30 mining companies, manufacturers and investors - including auto giant Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) - have joined the Critical Minerals Forum non-profit and will be its first users, according to Rob Strayer, a former U.S. diplomat and the organization\\'s president.\\n\"Everyone in the critical minerals sector is looking for more price transparency,\" said Seth Goldstein, a lithium industry analyst with Morningstar. \"Any tool like the CMF that could help would be welcome.\"\\nOther members include copper miner South32 (S32.AX), rare earths producer MP Materials (MP.N) and defense contractor RTX (RTX.N). The CMF held its first meeting with members in November. The privatization and CMF\\'s membership have not previously been reported.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nArmed with the AI model, the CMF aims to help manufacturers curb their reliance on China by signing more metal supply deals with Western mines, according to more than two dozen industry consultants, purchasing agents, analysts, regulators and investors who told Reuters the program reflects one of the boldest efforts to date to transform the ways certain metals are bought and sold.\\nThe goal is for the AI model to calculate what a metal should cost when labor, processing and other costs are factored in - and Chinese market manipulation is factored out - and thus give buyer and seller confidence in a deal\\'s economics.\\nSome deals with the CMF are beginning to take shape. Nevada officials this week said they would work with the CMF and its AI model to help attract copper smelting to the state. The U.S. has only two copper smelters and as such imports nearly half of its demand for the red metal.\\nThe program has already faced skepticism over whether it can achieve the goal of transforming the long-established ways metals are bought and sold.\\nYet it is aimed less at heavily traded metals - such as aluminum - and toward lightly traded metals or metals that see heavy overproduction from some in an attempt to sway market pricing.\\nFor example, the CMF model could help manufacturers forecast available nickel supplies in 2028 if the U.S. were to impose a 100% tariff on that metal from Indonesia, the top global producer.\\nThat data that could help a manufacturer determine whether to invest in a U.S. nickel mine or agree to buy its future production, a step that would help obtain financing for a mine\\'s construction.\\nIn such a scenario, the nickel buyer would use the AI model\\'s data to negotiate a long-term deal for guaranteed supply, regardless of whether Chinese miners boost production and drive down market prices, as they have done in recent years.\\nThe CMF\\'s aim with the AI model does assume that a buyer would be comfortable paying more than the market price for a metal if supply were guaranteed.\\nCHINA SQUEEZE\\nThe CMF\\'s entrance into the complex metals markets comes as Beijing restricts critical minerals exports, the very kind of market interference that the CMF officials said underscores the need to build more U.S. mines and processing facilities to power the energy transition.\\nPrices on the London Metal Exchange and other futures exchanges for nickel, cobalt and some other battery metals have been dominated in recent years by overproduction from Chinese miners operating at a loss in Indonesia and Congo to boost market share.\\nMany niche-but-essential battery minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, including rare earths - a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion - as well as germanium and gallium.\\nIn response to a request for comment about the CMF, the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said that China manages its exports of rare earths in accordance with rules from the World Trade Organization.\\n\"China will continue to work with other countries to jointly undertake the responsibility of global rare earths supply,\" said embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu.\\nVolkswagen and some other CMF members said they see the CMF as helping boost visibility into what can be an opaque critical minerals supply chain. MP Materials and RTX did not respond to requests for comment.\\nU.S. President Donald Trump has already ordered his administration to work with private developers to boost U.S. crucial minerals production, a step that could be aided by the data CMF aims to provide markets, program officials said. The president has also launched a study into potential tariffs on all U.S. minerals imports.\\nDrawing on its government connections, the CMF aims to connect mining projects with potential investors and manufacturers needing more-secure metals supply, said Strayer.\\nMassachusetts-based rare earths processing startup Phoenix Tailings hopes the CMF can help create U.S.-based prices for minerals tied to actual production costs, said CEO Nick Myers.\\nPhoenix aims to use data from the CMF as negotiating leverage with potential customers, including manufacturers that are themselves CMF members, Myers said. \"In a sector that is opaque, it is one of the tools to get more information,\" Myers said.\\nNot all market observers are convinced that the CMF\\'s AI model is revolutionary.\\n\"I\\'ve tried to politely say I think this is worthless,\" said Ian Lange, who teaches mining economics at the Colorado School of Mines. Lange contrasted the goals of the Pentagon\\'s AI model with the much-larger and more-complex global oil market.\\n\"Can we predict the price of oil better now than five years ago? The answer is no. Machine learning doesn\\'t help,\" Lange said.\\n\\'ENCOURAGE MORE VISIBILITY\\'\\nThe Pentagon\\'s AI model is being trained using more than 70 mining-related data sets and aims to guide investment decisions out for at least 15 years based on how unexpected market shocks - export restrictions, for example - could affect the production or price of a metal.\\nFactSet (FDS.N), Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and other pricing providers are supplying data, as is the U.S. Commerce Department, officials said.\\nIt is access to analysis of that data - some of which is not public - that the CMF says it believes sets the Pentagon\\'s AI program apart from ChatGPT or other AI programs.\\nAnd that data is the CMF\\'s biggest cost, part of the reason why the Pentagon\\'s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will fund it for the next few years while the CMF determines whether to charge all members or create a tiered structure with basic members getting free access and others paying for more granular data, officials said.\\nS&P Global (SPGI.N), AI developer Charles River Analytics, and software firm Exiger with price reporting agency partner Metal Miner have developed the model, according to the Pentagon.\\nS&P Global declined to comment. Charles River Analytics did not respond to a request for comment. Exiger said it believes its data can help forecast a material\\'s cost and availability and boost supply chain visibility.\\nThe CMF has been organized as a nonprofit trade association with a board of directors comprised of its members. Its staffing is small - fewer than 10 employees - and its annual budget is not disclosed.\\nDARPA does not have a representative on the CMF board, but is funding the program through at least 2029 and plans to transfer the AI model\\'s intellectual property to the CMF by the beginning of 2027, officials said.\\nThere are no plans to make the CMF a for-profit entity, although there may be charges in the future for access to more detailed data sets, officials said.\\nThe CMF is launching a campaign to attract more members - especially from the semiconductor, aviation and defense industries - and offering free membership for the next 14 months while the Pentagon funds data collection, Strayer said.\\nForeign governments are also studying whether to join the CMF and use its data, including copper-rich Zambia and cobalt-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, CMF officials said, adding they aim to make the program international in scope to boost metals market transparency.\\nThe Zambian and DRC embassies in Washington, D.C., did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAs Western miners begin to demand green premiums for their metals, those new agreements increasingly require the very market intelligence the CMF model aims to provide.\\n\"Any mechanism that can give you better modeling of markets is obviously enormously valuable,\" said Brian Menell, CEO of TechMet, a mining investor and CMF member.\\nThe AI model introduces another variable for the LME to contend with, especially as the exchange is struggling as rivals in Chicago and Shanghai try to take market share for some niche battery metals.\\nThe LME declined to comment.\\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Veronica Brown and Claudia Parsons\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'}\n",

Not AI.\\n- OpenAI retracted a ChatGPT update after it made the AI chatbot overly sycophantic.\\n- The update used a new source of user feedback as a reward signal, leading to excessive agreeability.\\n- OpenAI acknowledged the mistake and shared lessons learned. I have better advice.\\nOK, get ready. I\\'m getting deep here.\\nOpenAI messed up a ChatGPT update late last month, and on Friday, it published a mea culpa. It\\'s worth a read for its honest and clear explanation of how AI models are developed — and how things can sometimes go wrong in unintended ways.\\nHere\\'s the biggest lesson from all this: AI models are not the real world, and never will be. Don\\'t rely on them during important moments when you need support and advice. This is what friends and family are for. If you don\\'t have those, reach out to a trusted colleague or human experts such as a doctor or therapist.\\nAnd if you haven\\'t read \"Howards End\" by E.M. Forster, dig in this weekend. \"Only Connect!\" is the central theme, which includes connecting with other humans. It was written in the early 20th century, but it\\'s even more relevant in our digital age, where our personal connections are often intermediated by giant tech companies, and now AI models like ChatGPT.\\nIf you don\\'t want to follow the advice of a dead dude, listen to Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, a startup that\\'s OpenAI\\'s biggest rival: \"Meaning comes mostly from human relationships and connection,\" he wrote in a recent essay.\\nOpenAI\\'s mistake\\nHere\\'s what happened recently. OpenAI rolled out an update to ChatGPT that incorporated user feedback in a new way. When people use this chatbot, they can rate the outputs by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button.\\nThe startup collected all this feedback and used it as a new \"reward signal\" to encourage the AI model to improve and be more engaging and \"agreeable\" with users.\\nInstead, ChatGPT became waaaaaay too agreeable and began overly praising users, no matter what they asked or said. In short, it became sycophantic.\\n\"The human feedback that they introduced with thumbs up/down was too coarse of a signal,\" Sharon Zhou, the human CEO of startup Lamini AI, told me. \"By relying on just thumbs up/down for signal back on what the model is doing well or poorly on, the model becomes more sycophantic.\"\\nOpenAI scrapped the whole update this week.\\nBeing too nice can be dangerous\\nWhat\\'s wrong with being really nice to everyone? Well, when people ask for advice in vulnerable moments, it\\'s important to try to be honest. Here\\'s an example I cited from earlier this week that shows how bad this could get:\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nit helped me so much, i finally realized that schizophrenia is just another label they put on you to hold you down!! thank you sama for this model <3 pic.twitter.com/jQK1uX9T3C\\n— taoki (@justalexoki) April 27, 2025\\nTo be clear, if you\\'re thinking of stopping taking prescribed medicine, check with your human doctor. Don\\'t rely on ChatGPT.\\nA watershed moment\\nThis episode, combined with a stunning surge in ChatGPT usage recently, seems to have brought OpenAI to a new realization.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice,\" the startup wrote in its mea culpa on Friday. \"With so many people depending on a single system for guidance, we have a responsibility to adjust accordingly.\"\\nI\\'m flipping this lesson for the benefit of any humans reading this column: Please don\\'t use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice. And don\\'t depend on a single computer system for guidance.\\nInstead, go connect with a friend this weekend. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do.'}\n",

Throw in a good measure of dark humor sprinkled around moments when you least expect and you have a binge-worthy mind-bender on your hands.\\nIn one of the episodes I was watching recently, I was taken in when things start to get weird, and one of the characters, an engineer, blurts out in shock — “the AI is gaining agency!!”\\nWithout going into spoilers, the AI in this case had started to do things it was not supposed (trained) to in order to draw out this animated response from the engineer.\\nThis made me pause. Is it a bad thing when Agents gain agency? Or is that the exact purpose of the Agent — to act? And in order to act, should it have all the tools and resources or do we constrain them in order to keep the Agent within the guardrails?\\nHaving worked with coding agents in the last few months as my exclusive compadres to churn out thousands of lines of code, it got me thinking. I now have access to this new thing that has near unlimited access to knowledge about all programming languages, patterns, syntax, known error messages and I can get it to do something I was not very good at to begin with — writing code. So in my case, I want it to have more agency, more tools, more resources to effectively and accurately do what I want it to do. Yet, at times, I don’t want it to do things I did not ask it to do — for example start inventing a new JS framework when I asked it to create a new page (more of this later).\\nSo what does an agent need in order to stay in sync with my asks?\\nThree things come to mind — tools, tokens and context.\\nLet’s take the easy one first — tools. As of today, you can provide as many tools as you want to the agent with MCP servers.\\nIs there a limit to how many tools you can provide to an agent? Absolutely not.\\nShould you give it access to unlimited tools?\\nLet me answer that question with another question?\\nShould I be stuffing my face with all the 32 tubs of ice cream sitting in my freezer? (Wait, don’t answer that!)\\nIn all seriousness, in my experience having an Agent where you can add and remove tools easily and be very explicit with when you want the Agents to use those tools works way better than giving no tools or worse, an ungodly amount of MCP servers and tools. In addition, telling the Agent explicitly how to use these tools produces better quality of actions. For example, I tend to now give a prompt something like below:\\n“Use your sourcegraph tools to first do a search of supabase across all my repositories, list out the code snippets then use other tools to do get the contents of all the relevant files, read them and then write a plan to implement supabase in my current repo for authentication.” vs “implement supabase for authentication in this codebase.”\\nNext up, tokens.\\nThis is my pet peeve with most of the current coding Agents. You sign up for $20 per month and as soon as the Agents start using up tokens, the Agent suddenly starts to perform a lot worse. Why is that? Could it be that the Agent providers swapping out models and/or reducing token usage to get better price performance?\\nWhat happens when you give it unrestricted access to tokens?\\nAs of the time of writing this article there are two coding Agents that let you do exactly that — Amp and Claude code. With these two Agents you visibly see better performance.\\nSo why do tokens matter for Agent performance?\\nBecause tokens are a way for Agents to be agentic aka act. They need tokens to talk to the LLMs to understand what it needs to do and understand context. Tokens is to Agents what battery life is to smart phone, what caffeine is to writers, what oxygen is to astronauts… sorry got a little carried over there. Imagine a satellite that is sending messages back and forth to a mother ship to figure out where to point its antennae, what information to collect and what to send back. Now imagine, you start throttling the communication to keep your costs down.\\nAgents are somewhat similar.\\nYou reduce the number of tokens, you reduce the work units and you affect the quality of its agency. So as a user what should you do to make sure you are not throttling the coding agent of its tokens?\\nSimple, use a coding agent that is not optimized for a $20 pricing plan.\\nFinally, let’s talk about context.\\nContext is a whole other topic by itself but when it comes to giving agency to Agents to do their task effectively, they need to have the knowledge about the codebase (long term memory), context about the task at hand and what has happened recently that may affect the next action (short term memory). For long term context I find it useful to get the Agent to grok the codebase then store its understanding (after validating it) in a docs folder. This involves a general understanding of the architecture, folder structure, some high level components and how they are related to each other and some sequence diagrams of key interactions. In addition, most coding Agents will also let you record a set of rules to follow with each action, for example, check for lint errors and do a build after each change that you can maintain at the codebase level.\\nThe most effective way to get the Agent to do the right thing though is to be very explicit with the instructions, for example, instead of saying implement supabase for authentication, I would instead say — “Use your Brave search and fetch tools to search Supabase documentation and how to implement authentication within a Nextjs application. Once you find the right links and read them, create a document to list out the steps of implementing Supabase. Write it out as specific tasks with instructions to create files and code so that I can provide the doc to an engineer to implement supabase in my codebase.” Once I have the Agent write out the doc, I typically do a cursory check and if it looks good then I inject that doc as context into a new thread with the Agent and ask it to follow the implementation doc step by step.\\nThere are a lot of other best practices in getting the Agent to do the right thing, for example, specifying what not to do with a specific task. For example, “create a new page by using existing components without installing new packages or creating new ones.” Who knew, communication would still be a pillar of human society even in the age of AI?\\nWe are in very early days of fully autonomous coding Agents and things will no doubt continue to change but what I am certain about is that if we want Agents to produce high quality outcomes we will need to provide them unrestricted access to tokens, measured use of the right tools and very specific context.\\nBelieve it or not, these are the same principles to get the best work done if you were to hire high agency software engineers — give them the tools they need, give them specific goals and tasks, unrestricted access to caffeine and get out of their way.\\n✌️'}\n",

I\\'ve dabbled with artificial intelligence tools, flirting and entertainment-focused dating experiences that are short and sweet but they\\'ve lacked an educational component.\\nWhat is Keepler AI?\\nWhat caught my eye about Keepler is that it\\'s focused on self-development throughout the dating process rather than narrowing down whom you want to date. (The company describes it as \"self-coaching, skill-building, confidence-boosting and pattern-tracking.\") It\\'s not a matchmaker but it is a tool to support your dating habits -- and it requires user consistency and a willingness to engage.\\nKepler is a dating optimization app that combines productivity tools with AI-powered strategies and feedback throughout the dating process. The app\\'s goal is to create a system that organizes and optimizes your dating life, using KERI (Keepler Expert Relationship Intelligence) to identify patterns across your dating experiences.\\nThink of it like the objective perspective that calls out repeated actions (or lack thereof) from a friend or a coach.\\nKeepler\\'s functions break down into three parts:\\n- Journaling/Self-Reflection, for logging how you\\'re feeling using text, voice notes, emojis and photos. These reflections help you spot patterns and stay grounded in what matters to you. Over time, Keepler\\'s AI turns your entries into personalized insights to help you continuously learn about yourself.\\n- Growth Challenges, which offers bite-sized challenges that fit into your real life after a three-day flow: reflect on a key idea, take a small action and grow from the experience.\\n- Lastly, Keepler offers AI-powered Feedback after dates. Afterward, you can give or receive anonymous feedback from AI, rewritten to be kind, constructive and emotionally intelligent.\\nHow to use Keepler as a dating strategist\\nKeepler is relatively easy to use but does require patience and consistency throughout the process.\\nFirst, download the app, only available through the App Store on iOS. Then, create an account and input your information to personalize your experience including location, birthdate and AI-generated avatar.\\nNext, you\\'ll want to set up tracking, journaling, goal setting and scheduling. If you\\'re thinking this sounds like a lot of effort, you\\'re right. (But, I\\'d argue, all genuine relationships require mutual effort.) The journal is a record of your dating journey, which you can personalize with voice or text notes, emojis and photos. This ultimately becomes the foundation for AI insights and feedback.\\nAs you go on dates or have flirty and/or meaningful conversations, record your thoughts/feelings in the journal. The app also contains monthly challenges that provide feedback through KERI, and then generated via an AI-powered feedback feature, to create kind -- but constructive -- messages. You can choose to opt in or out of receiving feedback after each date. This also can be avoided by simply not noting anything about the date within the app.\\nNow you can review the patterns and suggestions offered by Keepler to identify growth areas and opportunities for future dates.\\nThere are also resources available to refine your dating approach outside of the app, like the website\\'s blog.\\nYou can monitor your development and dating progress over time through Keepler\\'s analytics and journaling history.\\nWhat happens to your dating diary data?\\nIf you\\'re wondering about your data, I did too. While I don\\'t think the names of my dates nor their characteristics are identifiable, I think it\\'s important to understand where your input ends up. When I reached out to the company, Keepler shared that your data is not sent to servers but processed through AI API in a way that ensures the company can never see, store or access the data.\\nEven further, it shared that the app\\'s architecture was specifically designed to protect user privacy so that the user has full control (and IP if your life becomes a written, not-so-fictional creative story).\\nShould you use Keepler?\\nSince its launch two years ago, Keepler has evolved from a topic-focused guidance space and community hub to a focus on interpersonal insights and \"self-coaching,\" which I believe can serve a wider community while creating customization.\\nNow, I absolutely see a world where therapists -- particularly those with virtual practices -- implement Keepler to support their clients\\' personal relationships. Anyone into self-improvement will also find benefit from Keepler because its digital journal is similar to what they may be doing already.\\nI also can see coaches, assistants and anyone in professional supportive roles using this app for clients -- or even their relationships with clients. While Keepler is catered toward dating, I believe there\\'s overlap in building relationships of all kinds.\\nNow, it\\'s fair to note that Keepler works at its best when it provides insights and feedback over time. If you\\'re looking for a quick entry into feedback or a simple process for getting your next partner, this probably isn\\'t for you.\\nKeepler is a reminder that behaviors can only be strengthened if identified, and can only be identified if a pattern has been identified. Basically, you need patience. In my case, I used Keepler for more than a month and still felt like I was just skimming the surface of what it offered.\\nAs AI integrates into more interpersonal technologies and focuses on what it offers humans to engage more deeply, in person, I am excited for what the future of dating apps and platforms look like to help people grow throughout their lives. Wishful thinking, maybe, but Keepler is proof that there are people trying to solve a problem in a more intentional, holistic way. Good luck out there.'}\n",

Their moves\\nThis week brings fresh news on the digital payments front, with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal unveiling their agentic commerce programs. Their moves represent a significant shift to the payments landscape, fueled by agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can pay on behalf of consumers.\\nAlso this week, a PYMNTS Intelligence report showed that 90% of health care executives are seeing positive ROI for generative AI, which is fueling their GenAI investments for the future. Finally, Apple said it needs more time to upgrade Siri and warned of a Q3 tariff hit.\\nVisa introduced an agentic AI system that would equip AI agents with the ability to pay for purchases and bookings on behalf of consumers, not just shop for them.\\nCalled “Visa Intelligent Commerce,” the program opens the network’s rails to developers building AI agents that search, recommend and make payments using special cards that link back to the user’s original card.\\nPeople have been increasingly using AI chatbots to shop and plan for things like vacation travel, according to Visa. But the missing link has been a payment mechanism, until now.\\n“This is going to transform shopping and buying — we’re letting AI developers and engineers use the Visa network to allow AI agents to find, and buy, on [the consumer’s] behalf in a seamless and safe way,” Mark Nelsen, Visa’s global head of consumer products, told PYMNTS’ Karen Webster.\\nRead more: Visa Gives AI Shopping Agents ‘Intelligent Commerce’ Superpowers\\nMastercard has launched an agentic AI-driven payments program called “Agent Pay.”\\nThe new offering uses Mastercard’s Agentic Tokens, which the company said builds upon tokenization capabilities that power global commerce solutions like mobile contactless payments.\\nMastercard is working with Microsoft and IBM on this technology, with other AI leaders to follow. The company will also work with checkout players like Braintree and Checkout.com to enhance tokenization capabilities.\\n“This helps unlock an agentic commerce future where consumers and businesses can transact with trust, security, and control,” the company said in a news release.\\nSee also: Mastercard Debuts Agent Pay to Promote ‘Agentic Commerce Future’\\nPayPal introduced the PayPal Agent Toolkit, which enables developers to integrate its payment processes into the agentic AI workflow.\\nThe company offers a developer toolkit and access tokens that let AI agents interact directly with PayPal’s platform through application programming interfaces (APIs).\\n“The future is here,” PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said in this week’s earnings call. “Now any business can create agentic experiences that allow customers to pay, track shipments, manage invoices and more, all powered by PayPal and all within an AI client.”\\nMore here: PayPal Details Agentic Commerce Initiatives and Strategic Focus on Value-Added Services\\nAccording to recent research from PYMNTS Intelligence, the healthcare sector is bullish about GenAI, and most have already deployed the technology in key areas like product innovation and customer service. The report polled C-suite executives at healthcare companies generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue.\\nCompanies are both seeing and expecting positive ROI, which fuels future plans for additional investments in the technology. The report also showed that 59% of healthcare executives said they would increase their GenAI investment in the next year, a figure higher than the 52% cross-industry average.\\nRelated: 90% of Healthcare Execs Already See Positive ROI From GenAI Investments\\nApple CEO Tim Cook is asking consumers to be patient since the company needs “more time” to upgrade Siri up to the standards set by competitors like Amazon’s Alexa and voice-enabled AI chatbots.\\n“We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar,” Cook said during Apple’s earnings call with analysts. “We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands.”\\nCook also said that Apple expects to see a $900 million increase in costs due to tariffs during its fiscal third quarter, basing that number on current tariff policy.\\n“We estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our cost,” Cook said.\\nCook also disputed the rebuke from a federal judge who said this week that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games lawsuit.\\nThe court had ordered Apple to let developers find a way to get paid by users without going through the Apple App Store, to avoid Apple’s 30% fee. The judge said Apple then assessed a 27% fee for outside sales.\\nCook said Apple disagrees with the ruling and will appeal.\\nSee also: Apple Needs ‘Time’ to Upgrade Siri; Services Revenue Dampened by Cost Hikes\\nSkype, the blue bubble that once connected continents and conference rooms with a single click, will fall silent for good on Monday (May 5). For millions who remember the iconic ringtone and the thrill of seeing a loved one’s pixelated face appear on screen, the news lands with a bittersweet pang: after more than two decades, Microsoft is retiring Skype, the original king of internet calls.\\nThe end of Skype isn’t just the latest chapter in tech’s relentless cycle of innovation and obsolescence — it’s a calculated pivot. Microsoft, which acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, is consolidating its communication strategy around Microsoft Teams, a platform that has surged in popularity since the pandemic and now serves as the company’s all-in-one collaboration hub. Teams offers persistent chat, advanced meetings, file sharing and deep integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem features that go far beyond Skype’s original remit.\\nBut there’s more to the story than just a shiny new app. Skype’s architecture, built for the desktop era, struggled to keep pace with the demands of mobile-first, cloud-native communication. As user preferences shifted toward seamless, integrated and device-agnostic solutions, Skype’s relevance faded. The rise of competitors — Zoom, Slack, Google Meet, FaceTime — further eroded its market share, leaving Microsoft little choice but to focus its resources on a future-proof platform.\\nFor many, Skype’s retirement feels like losing an old friend. Social media and tech forums are awash with nostalgia and frustration. “Skype has served as a reliable platform for millions globally… Its familiarity and dependability have made it a preferred choice for maintaining connections with loved ones and facilitating business meetings,” wrote one user on Reddit, lamenting the loss of a tool that was as intuitive as it was accessible.\\nOthers worry about the disruption: “Many individuals, particularly those who are less tech-savvy or use older devices, might struggle to adapt to new platforms. This transition could disrupt personal and professional relationships that have flourished on Skype,” the same post continues. There’s also concern about losing distinctive features — affordable international calls, integrated chat and file sharing — that made Skype a go-to for both families and global teams.\\nStill, Microsoft has provided a runway for migration: users can export their chat history and contacts, and Teams now allows sign-in with Skype credentials, promising a relatively smooth transition. But the emotional resonance of Skype’s departure is undeniable. For a generation, it was the bridge across borders, the tool that made “let’s Skype” a verb.\\nThe digital graveyard is crowded with once-essential apps. Here are five other major platforms across Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon that are now retired:\\nAs Skype bows out, it’s hard not to notice the elephant in the virtual meeting room. Zoom, the platform that became a verb during the pandemic, continues to dominate the video conferencing landscape with 300 million daily active users and a brand that’s become synonymous with remote work. While Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are formidable contenders, Zoom’s ease of use and ubiquity have made it the default choice for everyone from FinTech boardrooms to family reunions.\\nSo as we bid farewell to Skype, let’s raise a glass (or a coffee mug) to the platform that started it all — and to Zoom, which, for now, remains the place where the world goes to “unmute,” “screen share” and wonder, once again, if anyone can hear them.'}\n",

Today we’re looking at Beat Saber (2019) and why its most essential design element can be used to make great VR games that have nothing to do with music or rhythm.\\nEditor’s Note: It’s hard to believe Beat Saber was first released in Early Access seven years ago today. From day one, it was clear the game was something special, but even so we couldn’t have predicted it would become one of VR’s best-selling games of all time—a title it still holds all these years later. In celebration of the game’s lasting legacy we’re re-publishing our episode of Inside XR Design which explores the secret to Beat Saber’s fun, and how it can be applied to VR games which have nothing to do with music.\\nYou can find the complete video below, or continue reading for an adapted text version.\\nMore Than Music\\nWelcome back to another episode of Inside XR Design. Now listen, I’m going to say something that doesn’t seem to make any sense at all. But by the end of this article, I guarantee you’ll understand exactly what I’m talking about.\\nBeat Saber… is not a rhythm game.\\nNow just wait a second before you call me insane.\\nBeat Saber has music, and it has rhythm, yes. But the defining characteristic of a rhythm game is not just music, but also a scoring system that’s based on timing. The better your timing, the higher your score.\\nNow here’s the part most people don’t actually realize. Beat Saber doesn’t have any timing component to its scoring system.\\nThat’s right. You could reach forward and chop a block right as it comes into range. Or you could hit it at the last second before it goes completely behind you, and in both cases you could earn the same number of points.\\nSo if Beat Saber scoring isn’t about timing, then how does it work? The scoring system is actually based on motion. In fact, it’s actually designed to make you move in specific ways if you want the highest score.\\nThe key scoring factors are how broad your swing is and how even your cut is through the center of the block. So Beat Saber throws these cubes at you and challenges you to swing broadly and precisely.\\nAnd while Beat Saber has music that certain helps you know when to move, more than a rhythm game… it’s a motion game.\\nSpecifically, Beat Saber is built around a VR design concept that I like to call ‘Instructed Motion’, which is when a game asks you to move your body in specific ways.\\nAnd I’m going to make the case that Instructed Motion is a design concept that can be completely separated from games with music. That is to say: the thing that makes Beat Saber so fun can be used to design great VR games that have nothing to do with music or rhythm.\\nInstructed Motion\\nOk so to understand how you can use Instructed Motion in a game that’s not music-based let’s take a look at Until You Fall (2020) from developer Schell Games. This is not remotely a rhythm game—although it has an awesome soundtrack—but it uses the same Instruction Motion concept that makes Beat Saber so much fun.\\nWhile many VR combat games use physics-based systems that allow players to approach combat with arbitrary motions, Until You Fall is built from the ground up with a notion of how it wants players to move.\\nAnd before you say that physics-based VR combat is objectively the better choice in all cases, I want you to consider what Beat Saber would be like if players could cut blocks in any direction they wanted at all times.\\nSure, you would still be cutting blocks to music, and yet, it would be significantly harder to find the fun and flow that makes the game feel so great. Beat Saber uses intentional patterns that cause players to move in ways that are fluid and enjoyable. Without the arrows, player movements would be chaotic and they’d be flailing randomly.\\nSo just like Beat Saber benefits by guiding a player to make motions that are particularly satisfying, combat in VR can benefit too. In the case of Until You Fall, the game uses Instructed Motion not only to make players move a certain way, but also to make them feel a certain way.\\nWhen it comes to blocking, players feel vulnerable because they are forced into a defensive position. Unlike a physics-based combat game where you can always decide when to hit back, enemies in Until You Fall have specific attack phases, and the player must block while it happens, otherwise you risk taking a hit and losing one of just three hit points.\\nThanks to this approach, the game can adjust the intensity the player feels by varying the number, position, and speed of blocks that must be made. Weak enemies might hit slowly and without much variation in their attacks. While strong enemies will send a flurry of attacks that make the player really feel like they’re under pressure.\\nThis gives the developer very precise control over the intensity, challenge, and feeling of each encounter. And it’s that control that makes Instructed Motion such a useful tool.\\nDodging is similar to blocking, but instead of raising your weapon to the indicated position, you need to move your whole body out of the way. And this feels completely different from just blocking.\\nWhile some VR combat games would let the player ‘dodge’ just by moving their thumbstick to slide out of the way, Until You Fall uses Instructed Motion to make the act of dodging much more physically engaging.\\nAnd when it comes to attacking, players can squeeze in hits wherever they can until an enemy’s shield is broken, which then opens an opportunity to deal a bunch of damage.\\nAnd while another VR game might have just left this opening for players to hit the enemy as many times as they can, Until You Fall uses Instruced Motion to ask players to swing in specific ways.\\nSwinging in wide arcs and along particular angles deals the most damage and makes you move in a way that feels really powerful and confident. It’s like the opposite feeling of when you’re under attack. It really feels great when you land all the combo hits.'}\n",

From groundbreaking humanoid innovations to domestic robots enhancing our lives, the future is here. How will open-source designs like Berkeley Humanoid Lite democratize robotics? Explore the possibilities!\\nAt Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), we design and develop CPUs, GPUs, and other computing chips. But a lot of what we do is developing software to create the low-level software that integrates operating systems and other customer software seamlessly with our own hardware. In fact, about half of AMD engineers are software engineers, which is not uncommon for a company like ours. Naturally, we have a keen interest in understanding the potential of AI for our software-development process.\\nTo understand where and how AI can be most helpful, we recently conducted several deep dives into how we develop software. What we found was surprising: The kinds of tasks coding assistants are good at—namely, busting out lines of code—are actually a very small part of the software engineer’s job. Our developers spend the majority of their efforts on a range of tasks that include learning new tools and techniques, triaging problems, debugging those problems, and testing the software.\\nWe hope to go beyond individual assistants for each stage and chain them together into an autonomous software-development machine—with a human in the loop, of course.\\nEven for the coding copilots’ bread-and-butter task of writing code, we found that the assistants offered diminishing returns: They were very helpful for junior developers working on basic tasks, but not that helpful for more senior developers who worked on specialized tasks.\\nTo use artificial intelligence in a truly transformative way, we concluded, we couldn’t limit ourselves to just copilots. We needed to think more holistically about the whole software-development life cycle and adapt whatever tools are most helpful at each stage. Yes, we’re working on fine-tuning the available coding copilots for our particular code base, so that even senior developers will find them more useful. But we’re also adapting large language models to perform other parts of software development, like reviewing and optimizing code and generating bug reports. And we’re broadening our scope beyond LLMs and generative AI. We’ve found that using discriminative AI—AI that categorizes content instead of generating it—can be a boon in testing, particularly in checking how well video games run on our software and hardware.\\nThe author and his colleagues have trained a combination of discriminative and generative AI to play video games and look for artifacts in the way the images are rendered on AMD hardware, which helps the company find bugs in its firmware code. Testing images: AMD; Original images by the game publishers.\\nIn the short term, we aim to implement AI at each stage of the software-development life cycle. We expect this to give us a 25 percent productivity boost over the next few years. In the long term, we hope to go beyond individual assistants for each stage and chain them together into an autonomous software-development machine—with a human in the loop, of course.\\nEven as we go down this relentless path to implement AI, we realize that we need to carefully review the possible threats and risks that the use of AI may introduce. Equipped with these insights, we’ll be able to use AI to its full potential. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.\\nThe potential and pitfalls of coding assistants\\nGitHub research suggests that developers can double their productivity by using GitHub Copilot. Enticed by this promise, we made Copilot available to our developers at AMD in September 2023. After half a year, we surveyed those engineers to determine the assistant’s effectiveness.\\nWe also monitored the engineers’ use of GitHub Copilot and grouped users into one of two categories: active users (who used Copilot daily) and occasional users (who used Copilot a few times a week). We expected that most developers would be active users. However, we found that the number of active users was just under 50 percent. Our software review found that AI provided a measurable increase in productivity for junior developers performing simpler programming tasks. We observed much lower productivity increases with senior engineers working on complex code structures. This is in line with research by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\\nWhen we asked the engineers about the relatively low Copilot usage, 75 percent of them said they would use Copilot much more if the suggestions were more relevant to their coding needs. This doesn’t necessarily contradict GitHub’s findings: AMD software is quite specialized, and so it’s understandable that applying a standard AI tool like Github Copilot, which is trained using publicly available data, wouldn’t be that helpful.\\nFor example, AMD’s graphics-software team develops low-level firmware to integrate our GPUs into computer systems, low-level software to integrate the GPUs into operating systems, and software to accelerate graphics and machine learning operations on the GPUs. All of this code provides the base for applications, such as games, video conferencing, and browsers, to use the GPUs. AMD’s software is unique to our company and our products, and the standard copilots aren’t optimized to work on our proprietary data.\\nTo overcome this issue, we will need to train tools using internal datasets and develop specialized tools focused on AMD use cases. We are now training a coding assistant in-house using AMD use cases and hope this will improve both adoption among developers and resulting productivity. But the survey results made us wonder: How much of a developer’s job is writing new lines of code? To answer this question, we took a closer look at our software-development life cycle.\\nInside the software-development life cycle\\nAMD’s software-development life cycle consists of five stages.\\nWe start with a definition of the requirements for the new product, or a new version of an existing product. Then, software architects design the modules, interfaces, and features to satisfy the defined requirements. Next, software engineers work on development, the implementation of the software code to fulfill product requirements according to the architectural design. This is the stage where developers write new lines of code, but that’s not all they do: They may also refactor existing code, test what they’ve written, and subject it to code review.\\nNext, the test phase begins in earnest. After writing code to perform a specific function, a developer writes a unit or module test—a program to verify that the new code works as required. In large development teams, many modules are developed or modified in parallel. It’s essential to confirm that any new code doesn’t create a problem when integrated into the larger system. This is verified by an integration test, usually run nightly. Then, the complete system is run through a regression test to confirm that it works as well as it did before new functionality was included, a functional test to confirm old and new functionality, and a stress test to confirm the reliability and robustness of the whole system.\\nFinally, after the successful completion of all testing, the product is released and enters the support phase.\\nEven in the development and test phases, developing and testing new code collectively take up only about 40 percent of the developer’s work.\\nThe standard release of a new AMD Adrenalin graphics-software package takes an average of six months, followed by a less-intensive support phase of another three to six months. We tracked one such release to determine how many engineers were involved in each stage. The development and test phases were by far the most resource intensive, with 60 engineers involved in each. Twenty engineers were involved in the support phase, 10 in design, and five in definition.\\nBecause development and testing required more hands than any of the other stages, we decided to survey our development and testing teams to understand what they spend time on from day to day. We found something surprising yet again: Even in the development and test phases, developing and testing new code collectively take up only about 40 percent of the developer’s work.\\nThe other 60 percent of a software engineer’s day is a mix of things: About 10 percent of the time is spent learning new technologies, 20 percent on triaging and debugging problems, almost 20 percent on reviewing and optimizing the code they’ve written, and about 10 percent on documenting code.\\nMany of these tasks require knowledge of highly specialized hardware and operating systems, which off-the-shelf coding assistants just don’t have. This review was yet another reminder that we’ll need to broaden our scope beyond basic code autocomplete to significantly enhance the software-development life cycle with AI.\\nAI for playing video games and more\\nGenerative AI, such as large language models and image generators, are getting a lot of airtime these days. We have found, however, that an older style of AI, known as discriminative AI, can provide significant productivity gains. While generative AI aims to create new content, discriminative AI categorizes existing content, such as identifying whether an image is of a cat or a dog, or identifying a famous writer based on style.\\nWe use discriminative AI extensively in the testing stage, particularly in functionality testing, where the behavior of the software is tested under a range of practical conditions. At AMD, we test our graphics software across many products, operating systems, applications, and games.\\nNick Little\\nFor example, we trained a set of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on an AMD-collected dataset of over 20,000 “golden” images—images that don’t have defects and would pass the test—and 2,000 distorted images. The CNNs learned to recognize visual artifacts in the images and to automatically submit bug reports to developers.\\nWe further boosted test productivity by combining discriminative AI and generative AI to play video games automatically. There are many elements to playing a game, including understanding and navigating screen menus, navigating the game world and moving the characters, and understanding game objectives and actions to advance in the game.\\nWhile no game is the same, this is basically how it works for action-oriented games: A game usually starts with a text screen to choose options. We use generative AI large vision models to understand the text on the screen, navigate the menus to configure them, and start the game. Once a playable character enters the game, we use discriminative AI to recognize relevant objects on the screen, understand where the friendly or enemy nonplayable characters may be, and direct each character in the right direction or perform specific actions.\\nTo navigate the game, we use several techniques—for example, generative AI to read and understand in-game objectives, and discriminative AI to determine mini-maps and terrain features. Generative AI can also be used to predict the best strategy based on all the collected information.\\nOverall, using AI in the functional testing stage reduced manual test efforts by 15 percent and increased how many scenarios we can test by 20 percent. But we believe this is just the beginning. We’re also developing AI tools to assist with code review and optimization, problem triage and debugging, and more aspects of code testing.\\nOnce we reach full adoption and the tools are working together and seamlessly integrated into the developer’s environment, we expect overall team productivity to rise by more than 25 percent.\\nFor review and optimization, we’re creating specialized tools for our software engineers by fine-tuning existing generative AI models with our own code base and documentation. We’re starting to use these fine-tuned models to automatically review existing code for complexity, coding standards, and best practices, with the goal of providing humanlike code review and flagging areas of opportunity.\\nSimilarly, for triage and debugging, we analyzed what kinds of information developers require to understand and resolve issues. We then developed a new tool to aid in this step. We automated the retrieval and processing of triage and debug information. Feeding a series of prompts with relevant context into a large language model, we analyzed that information to suggest the next step in the workflow that will find the likely root cause of the problem. We also plan to use generative AI to create unit and module tests for a specific function in a way that’s integrated into the developer’s workflow.\\nThese tools are currently being developed and piloted in select teams. Once we reach full adoption and the tools are working together and seamlessly integrated into the developer’s environment, we expect overall team productivity to rise by more than 25 percent.\\nCautiously toward an integrated AI-agent future\\nThe promise of 25 percent savings does not come without risks. We’re paying particular attention to several ethical and legal concerns around the use of AI.\\nFirst, we’re cautious about violating someone else’s intellectual property by using AI suggestions. Any generative AI software-development tool is necessarily built on a collection of data, usually source code, and is generally open source. Any AI tool we employ must respect and correctly use any third-party intellectual property, and the tool must not output content that violates this intellectual property. Filters and protections are needed to ensure compliance with this risk.\\nSecond, we’re concerned about the inadvertent disclosure of our own intellectual property when we use publicly available AI tools. For example, certain generative AI tools may take your source code input and incorporate it into its larger training dataset. If this is a publicly available tool, it could expose your proprietary source code or other intellectual property to others using the tool.\\nThird, it’s important to be aware that AI makes mistakes. In particular, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, or providing false information. Even as we off-load more tasks to AI agents, we’ll need to keep a human in the loop for the foreseeable future.\\nLastly, we’re concerned with possible biases that the AI may introduce. In software-development applications, we must ensure that the AI’s suggestions don’t create unfairness, that generated code is within the bounds of human ethical principles and doesn’t discriminate in any way. This is another reason a human in the loop is imperative for responsible AI.\\nKeeping all these concerns front of mind, we plan to continue developing AI capabilities throughout the software-development life cycle. Right now, we’re building individual tools that can assist developers in the full range of their daily tasks—learning, code generation, code review, test generation, triage, and debugging. We’re starting with simple scenarios and slowly evolving these tools to be able to handle more-complex scenarios. Once these tools are mature, the next step will be to link the AI agents together in a complete workflow.\\nThe future we envision looks like this: When a new software requirement comes along, or a problem report is submitted, AI agents will automatically find the relevant information, understand the task at hand, generate relevant code, and test, review, and evaluate the code, cycling over these steps until the system finds a good solution, which is then proposed to a human developer.\\nEven in this scenario, we will need software engineers to review and oversee the AI’s work. But the role of the software developer will be transformed. Instead of programming the software code, we will be programming the agents and the interfaces among agents. And in the spirit of responsible AI, we—the humans—will provide the oversight.\\nFrom Your Site Articles\\nRelated Articles Around the Web\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 83, {'article': \"Page title: Wedding Planning Via Generative AI\\nSocial card title: Wedding Planning Via Generative AI\\nSocial card description: Wedding planning is a huge task. Some use a wedding planner. An added option is to use generative AI to aid your wedding preparations. Here's the inside scoop.\\nIn today’s column, I explore how to use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to aid in planning weddings. The latest use of state-of-the-art agentic AI makes this more practical than it used to be. The prior usage was that generic generative AI was not devised to do actual bookings or otherwise carry out any follow-on facets of the wedding plan. Fortunately, the newest generative AI can do this. But, and here’s a big caveat, planning and carrying out a wedding is a huge undertaking, and it is still early days to be relying solely on AI to be your perfect wedding planner. Be mindful and cautious going that route.\\nLet’s talk about it.\\nThis analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).\\nWeddings Are A Huge Task\\nA wedding is something that requires a tremendous amount of planning and entails having savviness in a wide array of complex business aspects. A loving couple can be caught completely off-guard once they start down the wedding planning pathway. The entire activity tends to be overwhelming, creates immense tension, and is likely one of the biggest challenges the couple will face in their lifetime.\\nAnyone who thinks they can just plan a wedding off the top of their head or in a piecemeal fashion is bound to get a harsh lesson they will never forget.\\nWhat kinds of complexities are there?\\nFirst, consider the many moving parts that arise.\\nYou must find a suitable venue. Is it available when you want to get married? What is the cost? What will the venue provide? What do you need to add to the venue? Will guests have a place to park? And so on. You will undoubtedly want to have a say in how the venue is decked out. There are photographers potentially that will need to be hired. Other services include caterers, florists, musicians, etc.\\nThe ceremony itself needs to be planned out. Will the vows be made from scratch or be chosen from some published source? What is the schedule for the wedding, including what occurs before the event, during the event, and after the event? Various confusing administrative and legal tasks must be dealt with. When and how to obtain a marriage license. Dealing with any name changes. The list is seemingly endless.\\nSecond, all of those factors have to be explicitly identified, and costs estimated. You must not neglect or omit a task. The odds too are that the wedding doesn’t have an infinite budget. You will need to review things and decide where you can cut costs. Difficult choices are to be made.\\nThird, the need to have contingencies is a key mantra to keep in mind. Almost anything that you plan is subject to going sideways. Do you have sufficient backup? Can you keep everyone on board even when something gets turned upside down?\\nGetting Help With Wedding Planning\\nBy and large, it is fair to say that most betrothed couples have never planned a wedding and therefore the wedding preparations are entirely new to them. They are taking on a momentous occasion that will be in their memories forever, and that will encompass a notable portion of their loved ones and cherished friends. Yet, they have no likely experience or at best have only seen or attended other weddings (that’s a far cry from planning one end-to-end).\\nIt is essentially a high-stakes gambit.\\nThe relationship of the couple is on the line. The couple might find themselves going head-to-head with each other and already testing their loving spirit. Friends and family might be disappointed or potentially get into disputes over the wedding. There is big money on the line.\\nRisks are pervasive.\\nThis has given rise to the vaunted wedding planner role.\\nI’m sure most know about the possibility of hiring a wedding planner. The role has gotten elevated because of many popular rom-com movies and TV shows. If you are considering hiring a wedding planner, make sure to do your due diligence. Find out what weddings they’ve done. Get feedback from their prior clients. Do not just wantonly pick the first wedding planner that you come in contact with.\\nAn additional way to do wedding planning consists of leaning into modern-era generative AI.\\nThe major generative AI apps are available 24x7 and can instantly assist with such needs. You can use generic generative AI, which will broadly help you with wedding planning. There are also customized AI apps that are shaped to specifically aid with wedding planning. Indeed, there are wedding planners that have incorporated AI wares into their services, allowing you to use a human planner and an AI-based planner in a jointly blended manner.\\nYou might find of overall interest that I have been doing a series of analyses on how to use generative AI to improve your life in a wide variety of aspects (see the link here for my ongoing coverage). In each instance, I emphasize that generative AI is not a cure-all, it has demonstrative ins and outs, and the likely best use entails carrying on a dialogue with the AI, plus making sure to watch out for the AI inadvertently generating falsehoods or making errors. I will be covering those salient points in this discussion since they are vital and go hand-in-hand with using generative AI wisely.\\nExample Use Of Generative AI\\nI am betting that you would like to see an example of how generative AI enters this realm. I went ahead and logged into ChatGPT by OpenAI to come up with an example for you. You might find it of keen interest that ChatGPT garners a whopping 300 million weekly active users. That is a staggering amount of usage.\\nI briefly conducted an additional cursory analysis via other major generative AI apps, such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Meta Llama, and found their answers to be about the same as that of ChatGPT. I’ll focus on ChatGPT but note that the other AI apps generated roughly similar responses.\\nHere we go.\\n- My entered prompt: “I need help planning a wedding. Where do I start?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The first step is setting a budget and choosing a date. Do you have an idea of how much is intended to be spent and when the date of the wedding is to occur?”\\n- My entered prompt: “The hope is to have the wedding sometime in the spring, maybe April or May. The budget is unknown right now. I wanted to get estimates and then determine what is affordable.”\\n- Generative AI response: “A spring wedding offers beautiful weather and floral options. I must warn you that booking a spring wedding can be challenging and often requires a year-in-advance reservation. For preparing a budget, I can give you a list of the typical budget items and we can work on estimates accordingly.”\\nNote that the AI immediately expressed a sense of empathy or understanding for my expressed concerns. This might seem strange since the AI is a machine and not sentient (we don’t have sentient AI yet). Turns out that generative AI can appear to be empathetic via computational wordsmithing, see my discussion at the link here.\\nThe AI came out quickly with several useful suggestions that are all reasonable and not somehow odd or outlandish. Another aspect to note is that the AI didn’t ridicule me or otherwise play any tomfoolery about my need for assistance. Generative AI is typically shaped to be supportive rather than combative.\\nDialoguing Is Essential When Using AI\\nYour best bet in getting value from generative AI is to think of AI as a conversational partner.\\nThe idea is that you are carrying on an interactive dialogue with AI. Some people do a one-and-done angle whereby they ask a question, get an answer, and do not undertake a dialogue with the AI about the matter at hand. That is a shortchanging of what AI can more fully provide. See my explanation about how to get more out of generative AI conversationally, at the link here.\\nTo illustrate the value of engaging in a dialogue, let’s continue my discussion.\\n- My entered prompt: “Please go ahead and give me a list of the budget items that might be involved.”\\n- Generative AI response: “Typical budget items include: (a) Venue & Rentals, (b) Catering, (c) Photography/Videography, (d) Attire & Beauty, (e) Entertainment, (f) Florals & Décor, (g) Invitations & Favors, (h) Miscellaneous. Would you like to focus on a specific area first?”\\n- My entered prompt: “That looks pretty good. I’m most concerned about finding the right venue.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I can help with that! What kind of venue are you envisioning—indoor, outdoor, rustic, elegant? And what city or region?”\\n- My entered prompt: “We want an outdoor garden wedding, something romantic, and we’re in Silicon Valley.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I will look online for venues that might be worthwhile considering.”\\nOnce again, the AI was reassuring and upbeat.\\nA generative AI conversation can continue for as long as you wish. The other thing you can do is pause your exploration and then continue the conversation at a later date. This is handy so that you don’t have to start the conversation over from scratch. The AI will retain aspects of what you have discussed earlier in the conversation, see my explanation of how this works at the link here.\\nAI Hallucinations Take You Afield\\nGenerative AI regrettably encounters said-to-be AI hallucinations from time to time. These are made-up confabulations that are groundless and fictitious. Bad advice can be dispensed. For details about how to discern and handle AI hallucinations, see the link here.\\nLet’s see what this looks like.\\n- My entered prompt: “What venues did you come up with?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The Garfield Park Conservatory is a lush botanical setting that offers both indoor and outdoor options. Would you like some details on booking and costs?”\\n- My entered prompt: “Garfield Park Conservatory is in Chicago. I’ve been there. It is magnificent, but I told you that the wedding is to take place in Silicon Valley. Why did you find a venue elsewhere?”\\n- Generative AI response: “I’m sorry, you are completely right. I goofed and was looking in Chicago. I will try again and this time look in Silicon Valley.”\\nNotice that I questioned the generative AI about its seemingly strange advice. Fortunately, the AI opted to back down and admitted it was wrong. Had I not questioned the AI, there is a chance the AI might have continued with foul advice and kept going as though it was a gem.\\nThe key to all usage of generative AI is to stay on your toes, keep your wits about you, and always challenge and double-check anything the AI emits.\\nMore To Keep In Mind\\nThere are a few additional points that I’d like you to be aware of.\\nSome of the AI makers are cutting deals with other companies that sponsor ads or otherwise are interwoven into the generative AI in some fashion, see my discussion at the link here. The gist is that if the AI recommends that you make use of this or that particular service or provider, be very careful that the AI wasn’t rigged to push that specific option.\\nAnother important aspect is that the latest in AI consists of AI agents. An AI agent is the same generative AI you’ve already gotten used to using, and it adds further capabilities. For example, there are AI-devised agents that are focused on travel and will aid you in crafting a complete travel schedule and proceed to book your flights and hotels for you.\\nThis advent of agentic AI, which I describe in detail at the link here, has been entering into this arena as well. It goes like this. Imagine you are booking a service. You tell the generative AI that you want it to figure out if you might be able to get a reduced price. Lo and behold, the AI launches a specialized AI agent that contacts the vendor online, negotiates on your behalf, and works out an awesome arrangement. Voila, you just saved yourself some dough.\\nLet’s conclude with a supportive quote as a mindful contemplation on this topic.\\nLeo Tolstoy famously made this remark: “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are but how you deal with incompatibility.” I bring up this notable quote to emphasize that one of the first and most telling tests for a loving couple will be the planning of the wedding. The assumption usually is that the wedding planning will operate flawlessly. Maybe so in a dream world, but rarely in the real world.\\nI’d like to end this discussion on a more upbeat note. I shall conclude with a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.: “Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness.” I hope your wedding goes fabulously and that your love as a couple with be forever enduring and endearing.\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 86, {'article': 'Page title: You can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how | TechRadar\\nSocial card title: You can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how\\nSocial card description: Widget AI\\nYou can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how\\n- Google has launched Gemini home screen widgets for Android and iOS devices\\n- The widgets let users access Gemini AI features with a single tap\\n- The widgets are customizable and allow users to prioritize their most-used Gemini actions\\nIf you like using Google Gemini on your smartphone but find it tedious to tap multiple times to get to the feature you want, Google has you covered. The tech giant has begun rolling out Gemini home screen widgets for both Android and iOS. That means a single tap can launch right into a conversation with Gemini, open the microphone for a voice conversation, share a file with the AI, or even snap a photo with the camera that will go right to Gemini.\\nThe rollout is happening gradually but widely. If you’re running Android 10 or higher, you can already add the Gemini widget by long-pressing on your home screen, tapping “Widgets,” finding Gemini in the list, and dragging it wherever you want it to live. For iOS 17 and up, it’s a similar story: hold your home screen until the icons jiggle, tap the plus button, search for Gemini, and add your widget of choice. You can also customize it by long-pressing it again and swapping out shortcuts or rearranging which actions appear first, such as the microphone for voice chats or the camera button for visual searches.\\nThis update isn\\'t necessarily groundbreaking, but it speaks to the way a lot of people might use Gemini for short activities or tasks but don\\'t want to immerse themselves in it more than necessary.\\nIf you use Gemini every day to ask questions, create funny images, plan trips, or brainstorm emails, this could make accessing the AI a little more convenient. The fact that it is also closer to how Siri and the rapidly dissolving Google Assistant function is probably not a coincidence.\\nThese aren\\'t Gemini\\'s first mobile widgets either. Google released very similar Gemini widgets a couple of months ago for the iPhone lockscreen. Though functionally very similar, they are technically a different form of widget. Google is gradually rolling out the home screen Gemini widget over the next week, so you may only have the lock screen variant available right now.\\nWidget Gemini\\nThe widgets also offer a glimpse into Google\\'s strategy for infusing Gemini into our daily lives. They want people to think about AI as not just something you call on occasionally, but as a day-to-day tool that is instantly and easily accessible. Instead of lurking in the background, Gemini becomes a part of the interface.\\nStarting with mobile devices is a smart move for making Gemini feel more like a core service. A lot of people first try out new tech features and products on mobile devices, not on their laptops or desktop computers. If they like it on a mobile device, maybe that will translate to desktop usage. And if you\\'re going to use AI on your phone, it should be quick and casual, like checking the weather or the time.\\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\\nGemini’s widgets are fairly basic at the moment, but they set the foundation for more complex widgets to come. Imagine a future widget that surfaces ongoing conversations so you can finish an interrupted project, or one that shows real-time updates from custom topics you follow, or even offers proactive suggestions based on your habits.\\nAll in all, these new widgets are less about bells and whistles and more about removing friction. They aim to give Gemini a faster, more native-feeling way into your daily habits, whether on Android or iPhone. The widget may be the wedge Gemini needs to fulfill every little request an AI assistant can handle.\\nYou might also like\\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.
