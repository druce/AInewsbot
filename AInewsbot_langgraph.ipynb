    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "- use new stateful OpenAI API, make some persistent assistants instead of complex prompts\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

       "• Gannett confirmed its use of natural language generation with human oversight, denying the content is advertorial despite affiliate links, while the practice follows previous AI controversies involving inaccurate automated sports stories and dubious AI-generated content by affiliated contractors.\n",

      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 88 (length 9745): • Walgreens is expanding its use of micro-fulfillment centers employing robots to fill prescriptions, aiming to have these centers serve over 5,000 stores by year-end, up from 4,800 in February 2024; the robocenters currently fill 16 million prescriptions monthly and handle 40% of prescription volume at supported sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The automation push is intended to reduce costs, free up pharmacists for patient care, and address staff burnout, generating approximately $500 million in savings so far and reducing fulfillment costs by nearly 13% year-over-year.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The expansion coincides with Walgreens’ planned $10 billion privatization deal with Sycamore Partners, expected to close by the end of 2024, amid broader operational shifts like store closures and increased focus on clinical services due to industry competition and staffing challenges.\n",
      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 89 (length 7868): • The Wavefront Frontier Detector (WFD) algorithm is a frontier-based robotic exploration method that enables autonomous robots to map and navigate unknown environments by identifying and prioritizing \"frontier\" zones—the boundaries between explored and unexplored areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The article provides a ROS-compatible Python implementation of the WFD algorithm, which uses a two-level Breadth First Search to scan for frontier cells and cluster them, allowing robots to sequentially explore all unknown regions until the map is completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Frontier-based exploration, initially introduced in 1997, remains a key strategy in robotics for real-world deployments such as warehouses and disaster zones, due to its simplicity and effectiveness in enabling autonomous self-directed navigation.\n",
      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 90 (length 9070): • AI is currently delivering tangible value in clinical trials by streamlining patient recruitment, automating data harmonization, and supporting compliance and safety through real-time monitoring and intelligent dashboards, resulting in shorter trial timelines and reduced costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Regulatory scrutiny is increasing around AI use in clinical research, with experts emphasizing the need for model validation, transparency, and ethical workflows, including human oversight: “Every design should have a human approving the decisions that a model generates,” said Sankarasubbu of Saama.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Key risks such as AI hallucinations, data bias, and patient privacy are being managed through grounding models in clinical-specific data, thorough understanding of data sources, rigorous privacy protections, and, when possible, decentralized approaches like federated learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The industry is encouraged to build strong AI governance and data protection practices now to prepare for the expected integration of quantum computing in the coming years, with 2025 designated the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology by the United Nations.\n",
      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 91 (length 6337): • Microsoft is expanding Copilot AI integration in Windows 11, adding an 'Ask Copilot' option to the desktop right-click context menu for certain files, enabling users to access AI-driven actions like summarization directly.\n",
      "• Copilot is being tested in the Microsoft Store, where a new button on product pages allows users to ask for buying advice or compare products, though this feature currently redirects users to the Copilot app with limited seamlessness.\n",
      "• Some advanced AI features, such as improved settings search and better Windows search, will be exclusive to Copilot+ PCs that have onboard NPUs for local AI processing.\n",
      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 92 (length 5963): • In April 2025, Windsurf (formerly Codeium) revamped its AI coding tool pricing by increasing the free plan to 25 prompt credits per month (up from 5), enabling up to 100 GPT-4.1 or o4-mini prompts monthly, and made premium features like unlimited Cascade, Fast Tab Completions, Command, and app Previews freely available.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The move has been positively received in the developer community, with feedback highlighting the increased free GPT-4.1 access, clarity in credit usage, and removal of confusing cost structures as major improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "• OpenAI is reportedly in talks to acquire Windsurf for around $3 billion, potentially enabling further development and discounted access to advanced AI models, while competitors like GitHub Copilot are also expanding free offerings in response.\n",
      "2025-05-12 09:48:34,713 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 93 (length 13936): • The article explains the inner workings of self-attention and multi-head attention in large language models (LLMs), emphasizing that individual attention heads are \"dumb\"—each performs simple pattern matching, while complex representations emerge through stacking multiple layers and heads.\n",
      "• The author clarifies that attention heads project input embeddings into query and key spaces to perform basic similarity checks, and richer, more complex information is built up by composing multiple layers, as seen in deep architectures like GPT-3 with up to 96 layers.\n",
      "• The post highlights the advantage of attention mechanisms over older RNN encoder/decoder models: attention allows context representations that scale with input length, avoiding the fixed-length bottleneck previously limiting long-sequence processing.\n"
