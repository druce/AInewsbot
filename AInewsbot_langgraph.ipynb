      "Social card description: CUDA Graphs -- a recent hardware feature introduced for NVIDIA GPUs -- aim to reduce CPU launch overhead by capturing and launching a series of GPU tasks (kernels) as a DAG. However, deploying CUDA Graphs faces several challenges today due to the static structure of a graph. It also incurs performance overhead due to data copy. In fact, we show a counter-intuitive result -- deploying CUDA Graphs hurts performance in many cases.\n",
      "  We introduce PyGraph, a novel approach to automatically harness the power of CUDA Graphs within PyTorch2. Driven by three key observations, PyGraph embodies three novel optimizations: it enables wider deployment of CUDA Graphs, reduces GPU kernel parameter copy overheads, and selectively deploys CUDA Graphs based on a cost-benefit analysis. PyGraph seamlessly integrates with PyTorch2's compilation toolchain, enabling efficient use of CUDA Graphs without manual modifications to the code. We evaluate PyGraph across various machine learning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over PyTorch2.\n",

       "• New research from Johns Hopkins University, presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations, finds that even advanced AI models consistently fail to interpret human social cues and dynamics as accurately as humans do.\n",
       "• In experiments where over 350 AI models were tasked with predicting human judgments of social interactions in video clips, none matched the consistency and nuance of human perception; video models, in particular, struggled to recognize communication, while language models performed somewhat better.\n",
       "• Researchers suggest AI's limitations stem from neural network architectures modeled on static image processing rather than mechanisms for understanding dynamic social scenes, with lead author Leyla Isik stating, \"None of the AI models can match human brain and behavior responses to scenes across the board, like they do for static scenes.\"\n",

However, deploying CUDA Graphs faces several challenges today due to the static structure of a graph. It also incurs performance overhead due to data copy. In fact, we show a counter-intuitive result -- deploying CUDA Graphs hurts performance in many cases.\n",
      "  We introduce PyGraph, a novel approach to automatically harness the power of CUDA Graphs within PyTorch2. Driven by three key observations, PyGraph embodies three novel optimizations: it enables wider deployment of CUDA Graphs, reduces GPU kernel parameter copy overheads, and selectively deploys CUDA Graphs based on a cost-benefit analysis. PyGraph seamlessly integrates with PyTorch2's compilation toolchain, enabling efficient use of CUDA Graphs without manual modifications to the code. We evaluate PyGraph across various machine learning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over PyTorch2.\n",
