      "Social card description: CUDA Graphs -- a recent hardware feature introduced for NVIDIA GPUs -- aim to reduce CPU launch overhead by capturing and launching a series of GPU tasks (kernels) as a DAG. However, deploying CUDA Graphs faces several challenges today due to the static structure of a graph. It also incurs performance overhead due to data copy. In fact, we show a counter-intuitive result -- deploying CUDA Graphs hurts performance in many cases.\n",
      "  We introduce PyGraph, a novel approach to automatically harness the power of CUDA Graphs within PyTorch2. Driven by three key observations, PyGraph embodies three novel optimizations: it enables wider deployment of CUDA Graphs, reduces GPU kernel parameter copy overheads, and selectively deploys CUDA Graphs based on a cost-benefit analysis. PyGraph seamlessly integrates with PyTorch2's compilation toolchain, enabling efficient use of CUDA Graphs without manual modifications to the code. We evaluate PyGraph across various machine learning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over PyTorch2.\n",

      "Social card description: After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n",

      "Social card title: PyGraph: Robust Compiler Support for CUDA Graphs in PyTorch\n",
      "Social card description: CUDA Graphs -- a recent hardware feature introduced for NVIDIA GPUs -- aim to reduce CPU launch overhead by capturing and launching a series of GPU tasks (kernels) as a DAG. However, deploying CUDA Graphs faces several challenges today due to the static structure of a graph. It also incurs performance overhead due to data copy. In fact, we show a counter-intuitive result -- deploying CUDA Graphs hurts performance in many cases.\n",
      "  We introduce PyGraph, a novel approach to automatically harness the power of CUDA Graphs within PyTorch2. Driven by three key observations, PyGraph embodies three novel optimizations: it enables wider deployment of CUDA Graphs, reduces GPU kernel parameter copy overheads, and selectively deploys CUDA Graphs based on a cost-benefit analysis. PyGraph seamlessly integrates with PyTorch2's compilation toolchain, enabling efficient use of CUDA Graphs without manual modifications to the code. We evaluate PyGraph across various machine learning benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over PyTorch2.\n",

      "Social card description: After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n",
