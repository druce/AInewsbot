    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- playwright sted selenium\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n"
