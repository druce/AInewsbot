Traditional evaluation methods focus only on the outcomes, leaving out critical feedback that could help improve the intermediate steps of problem-solving.

Traditional autoencoders, which rely on pixel-level losses such as mean squared error (MSE), tend to produce blurry outputs without capturing high-frequency details, textual information, and edge information. While adversarial methods, as applied by generative adversarial networks (GANs), have helped enhance the realism of reconstructions, they introduce other problems: instability in training and an inability to achieve high variability in generated images due to their deterministic nature. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for improving applications\n",
