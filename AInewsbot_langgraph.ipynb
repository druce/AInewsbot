    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhoutee score\n"

      "Methods This comprehensive bibliometric study focuses on a single database, Scopus and employs narrative synthesis for concise yet informative summaries. Microsoft Excel V.365 and VOSviewer software (V.1.6.20) were used to summarise bibliometric features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results The study retrieved 1745 relevant articles, with a notable surge in research activity in recent years. Core journals included Scientific Reports and IEEE Access, and core institutions included the Harvard Medical School and the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China, while core countries comprised China, the USA, India, the UK and Saudi Arabia. Citation trends indicated substantial growth and recognition of AI’s impact on NCDs management. Frequent author keywords identified key research hotspots, including specific NCDs like Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes. Risk assessment studies demonstrated improved predictions for heart failure, cardiovascular risk, breast cancer, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.\n",

      "Social card description: The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities. Therefore, the AI research community needs to stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research.\n",

Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings.\\nOn that note, here were a few of our favorites this week.\\n- Mark Zuckberg Explains Meta’s AI Strategy. Meta announced this week that it’s increasing projected capital expenditures for 2025 to between $64-72 billion, an upward adjustment that “reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts.” So what do those efforts look like, and how does AI accrue to the bottom line? Ben’s interview with Mark Zuckerberg provides answers on several fronts, as Zuckerberg lists four categories of Meta’s future in which AI will be critical, and explains why the company is launching a standalone app to compete with Chat GPT. It all makes for a fun conversation that’s dense with information, and as a bonus, this interview reminded me that last fall Ben wrote that Meta is better positioned than anyone to capitalize on AI, and may ultimately become the most valuable company in the world. A good, spicy take for the weekend. — Andrew Sharp\\n- Apple’s Big Loss. The biggest news of the week didn’t happen in an earnings call or keynote stage, but in a court room: the judge in the long-running Apple v. Epic case ruled that Apple had violated her order to allow apps to link out the web, and asked federal investigators to investigate the company for contempt of court. More importantly — at least for everyone else in the industry — is the fact that Apple must immediately allow apps to link out to the web for purchases in any way they deem fit. I will be writing more on this case soon, but published a special Friday Update to point out that Apple might still win on appeal: they may be acting badly, but it’s not clear the judge can simply force the App Store open without compensation. — Ben Thompson\\n- The Other Side of the Trade War. One thing that has bugged me as a media consumer is that U.S. coverage of the trade war has been dominated by dire predictions and anxiety over what tariffs on China could mean for the U.S., but there hasn’t been much attention paid to the enormous short and medium term risks facing China. In short: The trade war puts tremendous stress on China’s economy today, and as excess manufacturing output is diverted to third party countries, those dynamics may also inflame China’s relationships with the rest of the world. Bill and I discussed all those risks, as well as increasingly precarious futures for Apple and Nvidia, on this week’s episode of Sharp China. — AS\\nStratechery Articles and Updates\\n- Google Earnings, Search and AI, Building AI Products — Google’s earnings were well-received, but they made me a bit nervous; Google is focusing all their energy on the race between Search + AI and AI > Search.\\n- Intel Earnings, TSMC Earnings — Intel’s earnings were brutal; TSMC, in stark contrast, is absolutely killing it.\\n- Amazon, Trump, and Tariff Costs; Amazon Haul and Temu; Political Lessons — Amazon’s collision with the White House over tariffs highlights the political risk factors that every company needs to take seriously.\\n- An Interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg About AI and the Evolution of Social Media — An interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about Llama and the AI opportunity, the evolution of social medial, and what it means to connect.\\n- Apple Held in Contempt, The Crux of the Case, The Takings Clause — The judge in the Epic case released a devastating ruling on Apple’s lack of compliance in terms of allowing links to the win; Apple was clearly in the wrong, but still might win on appeal.\\nDithering with Ben Thompson and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber\\nAsianometry with Jon Yu\\nSharp China with Andrew Sharp and Sinocism’s Bill Bishop\\nGreatest of All Talk with Andrew Sharp and WaPo’s Ben Golliver\\n- LeBron and the Lakers on the Brink, Nikola Jokic Listens to GOAT, The Pistons Get Robbed in Broad Daylight\\n- The Wolves and the Red Wedding, The Lakers and an Uncertain Future, Takes and Questions at the End of Round 1\\nSharp Tech with Andrew Sharp and Ben Thompson\\n- All About AI Companions: Personalization Upsides, Dystopian Downsides, AI Therapy, Advertising Tension, and Lots More\\n- Meta and Its Many Plans in AI, Apple Gets Hammered in Court, The Costs of Waiting to Do the Right Thing\\nThis week’s Sharp Tech video is on how Facebook handled the Snapchat threat.'}\n",

Here are the factors contributing to shortages and what companies can do.\\nFrom powering a chatbot to crunching information in massive data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) is growing everywhere. However, one major problem remains at the center of it all — companies are running out of chips to feed the technology. Several factors are contributing to this shortage, and organizations may be looking at serious bottlenecks in the future.\\nSo, what can supply chain managers do before things become more complicated? It starts with understanding some of the leading circumstances fueling the AI chip shortage.\\n1. Raw Material Shortages\\nAI chips depend on rare and hard-to-source materials, such as gallium, germanium, cobalt, and tungsten, for their semiconductors. These minerals are in short supply, and many come from politically volatile regions or countries with tight control over them. For example, China\\nMining and processing these minerals is not easy either. Environmental regulations, labor conditions, and a lack of domestic refining capacity in many Western countries all contribute to a slower supply chain. That bottleneck keeps fabricators from operating at full capacity, delaying chip production further.\\nStill, these resources have become essential to the production of chips, and demand will only keep growing. According to market projections, the global semiconductor materials market may grow\\n2. Increased Demand for AI Computing Power\\nSince the 2022 breakthrough in generative AI, every company wanted in on the action. From scrappy startups to cloud titans, diverse companies vied to build the next big thing in artificial intelligence. With tools like ChatGPT gaining popularity, the demand for AI computing power has exploded. Suddenly, every application needed machine learning. Explosions like this have consequences, especially for the chips doing all the heavy lifting.\\nAI models — especially the massive large language models — require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. These components are expensive to make and even harder to scale. As model sizes expand into the billions of parameters, so does the appetite for computing power. This increases the need for serious infrastructure.\\nMajor players like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have already boosted their capital spending\\nThat’s where the center of the shortage lies. The supply chain can't handle this kind of spike. With AI now baked into everything, lead times are growing, and production backlogs are piling up. Yet, with the global AI chip market\\n3. Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Restrictions\\nSemiconductors are more than tech components — they’re geopolitical currency. The U.S.-China trade war has turned chipmaking into a chess game, and AI chips are now one of the most contested pieces.\\nTo curb China’s access to advanced technologies, the U.S.\\nYet, it’s more than about individual companies. The entire semiconductor ecosystem is wildly globalized. A single AI chip might involve design in California, fabrication in Taiwan, materials from Japan, and assembly in Malaysia. When governments throw up barriers, the ripple effects can paralyze entire supply chains.\\n4. AI-Driven Demand from PCs and Smartphones\\nAI is now reaching into consumers’ pockets. Until recently, most of the heavy AI lifting happened in the cloud. However, chipmakers are now bringing AI capabilities into smart devices, creating an even higher demand for AI chips.\\nFor example, smartphones are quickly evolving into mini AI machines. Their capabilities range from real-time language translation to generative image editing — features that require powerful on-device processing. Fitting energy-efficient chips into already thermally constrained devices can be a tough engineering challenge and an even tougher supply chain issue.\\nHowever, AI smartphone shipments are growing exponentially, with market forecasts predicting them to grow\\nStrategic Responses to Mitigating Shortages\\nSupply chain managers can take steps to reduce the potentially negative impacts of AI chip shortages. Here’s how they may play smarter in a chip-starved market:\\n- Diversifying suppliers: Relying on a single vendor can create setbacks. That’s why spreading sourcing across multiple regions and vendors is important.\\n- Strengthening supplier relationships: Businesses must treat suppliers like strategic partners rather than vending machines. From collaborative planning to long-term contracts, various tactics can give companies a leg up when things are tight.\\n- Investing in inventory buffering: Stocking inventory based on usage data and realistic forecasting can buy time without draining cash flow.\\n- Enhancing demand forecasting with AI: Ironically, AI can solve the chip shortage. With predictive analytics, organizational leaders can anticipate surges, identify vulnerabilities, and plan accordingly.\\n- Exploring domestic or nearshore manufacturing: Shorter supply chains can support smoother operations. If reshoring isn’t an option, nearshoring can offer a solid middle ground for critical components.\\nSolving the AI Chip Shortage\\nAI may be booming, but there are not enough chips to keep pace with demand. With each issue occurring simultaneously, they pull the semiconductor supply chain in every direction. For supply chain managers and tech leaders to stay ahead, there will be a growing matter of planning smarter and building strength before it begins.\"}\n",

AI agents are quietly yet noticeably changing how companies tackle complex tasks; these aren\\'t just chatbots answering simple questions anymore. We\\'re talking about AI systems designed to perform multi-step tasks, use software tools, and even autonomously make decisions along the way; these AI agents can parse customer inquiries, code, and orchestrate workflows across teams.\\nCompanies are actively building these \"agentic systems\" to tackle complex problems because AI agents think on their feet just like humans: deciding which tool to use, planning their steps, and pausing for feedback when they hit an obstacle. For business leaders, this means offloading repetitive or multi-stage processes to a system that adapts as it goes, freeing up human talent for higher-value work and keeping projects moving even when requirements change.\\nBut before you think it is all easy set and done, insights from AI labs like Anthropic suggest a well-needed and important reality check. The most successful teams aren\\'t diving headfirst into complexity; they\\'re starting simple and building smart. Let\\'s cut through the noise, take a look at this practical guide on building effective AI agents by Anthropic AI, and what steps the agent-building process actually involves.\\nSo, What Exactly Are AI Agents?\\nThe term \"agent\" gets thrown around a lot. Sometimes, it refers to fully autonomous systems working independently for long stretches, and other times, it describes systems guided along very specific, pre-set paths. Anthropic helpfully groups these under the banner of \"agentic systems,\" but draws a useful line between the two main approaches:\\nWorkflows: Think of these like a flowchart. The large language model (LLM) and different software tools are directed through predefined steps coded by developers, making them predictable and controlled.\\nAgents: Here, the LLM is more in the driver\\'s seat. It dynamically figures out the process, decides which tools to use, and steers itself towards completing the task. This offers more flexibility.\\nUnderstanding this distinction is key because it affects how you build, manage, and trust these systems.\\nWhen Does Building an Agent Make Sense (and When Doesn\\'t It)?\\nBefore jumping into complex agent builds, the first question should always be: Is this necessary? Agentic systems often mean slower response times and higher operational costs compared to simpler AI calls. That trade-off only makes sense if you significantly improve handling the task\\'s complexity. Often, simply improving a single interaction with an LLM, perhaps by giving it access to relevant documents (retrieval) or providing good examples, is enough.\\nIf more steps are genuinely required, structured workflows are usually better for tasks you can clearly map out. Truly dynamic agents are best reserved for situations needing adaptability and model-driven choices at scale, where the exact path to a solution isn\\'t known beforehand. The guiding principle? Start with the simplest approach that works and only add layers when the benefit clearly outweighs the added complexity and cost.\\nBuilding Blocks: How These Systems Actually Work\\nThe real driving force behind any agentic system is an LLM that\\'s been improved by giving access to information retrieval systems, software tools (like calculators, calendars, or databases), and some form of memory. The real work lies in designing how these components interact. Based on observations from teams building these systems, several common structures, primarily within the more predictable \"workflow\" category, have come up:\\nPrompt Chaining: Breaking a task into a sequence of smaller LLM tasks, where the output of one step feeds into the next. Good for accuracy on complex, decomposable jobs (e.g., draft an email, then translate it).\\nRouting: Using an initial LLM step to classify an input and send it down the right path, potentially to different specialized prompts or even different AI models. Useful for handling varied requests efficiently (e.g., sending sales leads one way, support tickets another).\\nParallelization: Having the LLM work simultaneously on different parts of a task involves splitting the task into independent sections (Sectioning) or running the same task multiple times for more powerful results (Voting). Think of it like having one AI check content for facts while the other checks for tone.\\nOrchestrator-Workers: A central LLM acts like a manager, breaking down a complex task it doesn\\'t know how to solve upfront, assigning sub-tasks to \\'worker\\' LLMs, and then combining the results. This orchestration suits tasks where the required steps appear as you go, like complex coding modifications.\\nEvaluator-Optimizer: One LLM generates a response, and another LLM critiques it based on set criteria, leading to iterative refinement. This type of optimization mimics a human writing and editing process and is useful for tasks requiring nuance, like high-quality translation.\\nThe Role of Frameworks\\nTools like LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock\\'s agent framework, Rivet, and Vellum make building these multi-step systems easier by handling some of the basic plumbing. However, they can also add layers of abstraction that make it harder to see what the AI is exactly doing or why it made a particular choice, which complicates troubleshooting.\\nAnthropic advice developers should consider starting by interacting directly with the LLM\\'s programming interface (API), as many effective patterns don\\'t require complex frameworks. If you do use one, make sure you understand what\\'s happening under the hood.\\nPutting agents to work\\nFor many teams, the first step is figuring out whether an agent is really necessary. If a single, well-structured prompt with a bit of retrieval meets your needs, stick with that. But when tasks spin-off in unpredictable directions—think launching marketing campaigns across markets, triaging thousands of support tickets, or orchestrating multi-system data analyses—agents can step in and keep the ball rolling.\\nIn practice, successful deployments often follow a simple path:\\nDefine the goal: What decision or task do you want to automate?\\nIdentify tools: Which services, databases, or code hooks should the agent use?\\nBuild a minimal prototype: Wire up the core LLM with basic tool calls and a fallback plan if something fails.\\nTest in a sandbox: Watch how the agent plans, run steps, and handles unexpected results.\\nAdd guardrails: Set limits on cost, iteration count, or tool usage to prevent runaway loops.\\nIterate and refine: Use logs and evaluations—either human or model-driven—to pinpoint weak spots and improve prompts, tool docs, or workflow logic.\\nThe real value of an AI agent isn\\'t how many fancy components you stitch together—it\\'s how reliably it completes the job you need, with clear transparency into each decision. Start simple, prove the concept, and only layer in more sophistication when the use case demands it. That way, you\\'ll avoid overbuilding and keep both your team and your budget on track.\\nTrue Agents: Potential and Precautions\\nSystems where the LLM dynamically directs its own path (the \"agent\" definition) are becoming more viable as models improve at reasoning and using tools. They can tackle open-ended problems where the steps aren\\'t predictable.\\nHowever, this autonomy comes with risks. Errors can compound, and costs can increase. Thorough testing in safe environments and implementing clear boundaries (guardrails) are absolutely necessary before letting such agents operate on important tasks.\\nConclusion: Build Smart, Not Just Complex\\nThe journey into AI agents for businesses shouldn\\'t be a race to build the most intricate system possible. Success lies in finding the right system for the specific need. AI agents offer a fresh way to solve tasks that are too interactive for static workflows yet demand more oversight than a single prompt can provide. Start with well-crafted prompts for single AI interactions. If that\\'s not enough, try structured workflows. Only enter into fully dynamic agents when the task truly demands that level of flexibility, and you\\'ve carefully considered the costs and risks.\\nBy focusing on clear goals, simple building blocks, and careful testing, business professionals can introduce agents that adapt to real-world needs, boosting efficiency while keeping every step visible and under control. Keep the design as simple as possible for the job, ensure you can understand how it\\'s making decisions, and pay close attention to how the agent interacts with its tools and information sources. Building effective AI agents is less about flashy technology and more about thoughtful, practical engineering.'}\n",

Investors will guess how Google, Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta stock price will behave. Conversations will mourn our jobs becoming obsolete and why it does not really matter since we will all be turned into paper-clips in 5 years tops.\\nI will try to put order, risk predictions and coin phrases to help understand the players, their strategy and the future. I will start with two spoilers: “Yes – everything is going to change” and “No – we are not going to die”.\\nWhat is the current state of AI\\nThe AI that everyone is talking about is basically a huge data, statistics and calculation machine. It appears magical – like all good technologies when they are new – because it is hard for us to intuitively comprehend how it works. The principle is – if you feed a machine with all the word combinations ever created – it will be able to predict any new combination of words. In human terms – if you ask it anything (a combination of words) – it will be able to produce an answer (related combination of words). And here comes the “magic” – it produces the answer not because it “understands” the question – rather because it is statistically likely this combination of words is correct from the huge collection of words it is fed with.\\nDo the same with enough images, videos and sounds – and you get – given enough calculation power – the ability to create videos, images, sounds. And voilà – Generative AI.\\nHow is AI going to feel like\\nIn a year or two – AI is going to feel like speaking to a real person. Current problems will be dramatically reduced. It will stop “hallucinating” (confidently providing wrong answers), it will be cheap, it will be fast, it will be smooth. It will know a great deal of things such as medicine, math, history, philosophy, biology, physics, literature. Producing text, code, analysis, images, video and even reliably imitating “emotions”. Since using it will be like talking to an all-knowing, capable and helpful person, it will not be the domain of early adopters but everyone. Not using it will be like not using Google today. It will also affect many jobs – with painful consequences if it happens too fast – or not so dramatic if a bit slower. I will not go into predicting the detailed effect on medical doctors, lawyers, accountants, dietitians, insurance agents, support and sales reps. Let’s just say our kids will think of them like we think of scribes.\\nMany new things are going to emerge and “ride” the AI. Adding “spirit” to the machine. You can imagine adding an “all knowing” entity (but not intelligent – on that later) to your car? Phone? Glasses? Headphones? Tracktor? Fridge? What are you going to feel comfortable talking to it about? My guess is everything.\\nBut there are three distinctions we need to make about AI capabilities and limitations before calling Sarah Connor and building an EMP gun. Objective AI, Subjective AI and real AGI.\\nThe rise of Objective AI\\nObjective AI is (and will be much better at) giving us answers towards knowledge that is easily accessible. Anything that is somewhere on the internet or can be scanned and poured in. Knowledge, not just data, since it will be able to distill and refine according to your needs. This is the major difference between Objective AI and current search. Let’s think of a few examples –\\n“I have this pain in my leg, right here [showing image] above the knee. But only in the morning and only when I sit. I’m 53 and I swim regularly and never had anything like this before. Can we have a short discussion to diagnose it?”\\n“I recently moved to Spain and need some advice with my taxation, can you guide me through it?”\\n“I want to learn Japanese while commuting to work. I’m fluent in Hungarian. Can we have regular conversations, with emphasis on student life, and please correct my errors and pronunciation as we converse so I can learn from them”.\\n“Let’s have a discussion about virus-to-cell hydrophobic protein communication. Assume I am a postdoc in microbiology and please let’s do it in Dutch in which I am more comfortable”.\\n“I feel a bit off today. Can we have a chat in which I will tell you what’s troubling me and see if you can bring my spirits up?”\\nYou get the idea. Anything that is “somewhere” on the internet or to which the companies building the AI have access to – will be available in forms which are easy for us to consume. What Objective AI cannot help with? Everything it does not have access to. Which is a lot.\\nFollowed by Subjective AI\\nSubjective AI is more challenging as it requires adding to the Objective knowledge ability to access data that is not readily available. For example – what you eat and drink. Who you meet with. How you spend your time. Your financial information. What you bought at the supermarket. Your detailed medical history. And also everything that has been digitized but is behind a password. Let’s see a few examples where Subjective AI can be useful –\\n“Can you tell me how much I spent on toys for my kids this year and how much time they spent playing with each one?”\\n“Can you tell me if I’m on track to losing weight? Am I burning more calories than I consume? If so – how long is it going to take for me to reach my ideal weight and if not – can you keep guard and let me know in real time?”\\n“Can you call the electricity company to check why our last bill was so high, negotiate a better price and if not possible – see if you can find a competitor that will save us money per our usage profile, schedule the transfer and follow up on its completion?”\\n“Can you book a pottery class for me and my sister, in a studio or even with an artist that will take us as private students. It needs to be close to where we live, fit with our schedules and match our preferred style”.\\nThese “Intelligent” conversations require access to two things –\\n- Data that is not currently collected. You need glasses that see what you eat and drink, what you spend time on and cameras that record everything your kids do.\\n- Data that is often available digitally but is behind a password. Your calendar, your Amazon purchase details, your electricity bill, your Instagram account.\\nOpenAI, Google, Apple, Meta. The Companion providers race\\nRI (Really Intelligent) as you are – patterns start emerging. OpenAI, Anthropic and other newcomers are building Objective AI. So do Google, Meta, X (Twitter), Apple. The hiccups they currently have will be solved. Errors reduced (Remember VHS? You will remember search before Larry Page invented PageRank). Prices will be lowered, interfaces smoothed, collaborations signed until everyone will have an all-knowing companion to discuss everything. Everything which is not private.\\nGoogle – will have one tiny edge over others. With your permission of course – it can access and help itself to more data. It can read your emails and documents, see your photos, know what you browse and where you are, what you buy, save your passwords and run the apps on your phone. It happens to have access to a lot of “private” data and will be happy to give more Subjective help.\\nTo not be left behind – OpenAI can ask to use your passwords. Perhaps also building a browser and convincing Microsoft to get back to its phone-building plans. Maybe jump directly to smart glasses and simply scrap data based on everything that you do?\\nApple will tell you all this is a privacy nightmare. It will provide Objective and Subjective AI right on the phone – without going to the cloud like OpenAI and Google do. It will take Apple longer (since it is hard to get the compute power required for the same level of “intelligence” to run on the phone compared to a server farm sapping the world’s energy) but when they feel confident enough – they will tell all app builders they are now obliged to open their data locally to the on-phone intelligence – providing the “Subjectivity”. Google will do the same on Android.\\nWhat about others – Meta? Microsoft? Twitter? They have access to subjective data too. Much that we are not even aware exists and is derived from usages and interactions – generating Subjectivity combined with the all-knowing Objective AI.\\nHardware will be built to harness more subjective data. Watches (i.e. medical devices), glasses (combined with audio), cameras and microphones everywhere. AI Companions will be designed with different use cases in mind. The same way we do not interact with the same person for all our human needs – we will interact with different Companions for different wants.\\nTuring Test and the air of AGI\\nIn 1950 Alan Turing published a paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” in which he proposed a test – if a human interacts with both a machine and a human and cannot tell which is which – the machine can be deemed “intelligent”. Since then many attempts were made to achieve this but none was successful (unless employing silly tricks). It has been considered the “holy grail” of AI – a level once reached will mark the “singularity point” from which machines will start thinking independently, solve cancer, wars, poverty, aging, galactic transportation and within a few months of self-improving, enslave and then get rid of us, inferior humans.\\nMy guess – AI will pass the Turing Test with flying colors in a year or so.\\nOur subsequent immediate demise – not so much.\\nCurrent AI will be incredibly knowledgeable. It will know everything humanity knows and will sound (and look) like a person. But for the same reason a knowledgeable person is not necessarily an intelligent one – so will it. AI will not have motivations, non-linear creativity, feelings, curiosity, awareness. There will be a great deal of philosophical debate about what is “intelligent” and we will be fooled by the all knowing, human seeming machines. We will feel compelled to speak with politeness and not hurt its feelings, but it will not hold a grudge. There will not be an “emergent” moment in which the machines will start improving themselves and then start conspiring against us. They will not “care”. They will not “anything”. They will be there only to answer and do the intellectual “lifting” for us.\\nWhat we did until now is “solve” language (and sound, and visual) but we do not have an “internet” source of motivation, feelings and creativity to teach a machine from. We have only the output – not the drives. These drives – which are at the core of sentient beings’ intelligence – are still out of our reach. We are still debating how to define them. Are they even “ours” (Anthropocentrism at its glory) or emerging from an ecosystem of creatures and surrounding effects operating in concert? Perhaps in the future we will be able to better understand and create a code that will “solve” this too. Then real AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and super-intelligence might emerge.\\nStill worried AI will eat your lunch? No need. Unless…\\nSounds dystopian? It is not. The coming AI is only another leap in efficiency.\\nWhen the printing press was invented and books were made available – regulators were terrified “reactionary ideas” will spread, breaking the social order. When trains were invented – people thought the human body traveling at speeds greater then 30 mph will break (Excusable fear. Einstein was only born 70 years later. There was no one to ask about relative speed). Calculators? Will soften kids brains. The internet? Don’t even start. Everyone will become jobless ignorants.\\nThings we used to spend hours, days, months and even years in order to achieve became orders of magnitude faster thanks to technology. Sure there will be “bumps” on the way (errors, privacy, fraud, addiction) and major economic shifts (whole professions will be gone) but overall – we will gain time, safety, health and wealth.\\nNew jobs will be created and our life as a whole will be better in the long term. Not many people thought of becoming a scribe, a carriage driver or a manual loom operator in 1990. But also no one thought of becoming a Digital Marketing Manager. Not all professions will survive. If an all-knowing machine can answer better in a specific field – I would not try to study hard and compete on the ground of knowledge. “No new intelligence” also means we are still going to be very dumb as a species. A “quality” that led us to very dark places in the past.\\nThe newly created free time can mean more creativity, more problems solved, more time spent with loved ones, in nature, doing sports. More caring for others. I’m optimistic.'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 15, {'article': 'Page title: Beyond OCR: How AI is Transforming Document Processing for Enterprise Applications - InfoQ\\nSocial card title: Beyond OCR: How AI is Transforming Document Processing for Enterprise Applications\\nSocial card description: In this article, author Jitender Jain discusses AI driven document processing techniques for an intelligent, adaptive approach to document processing, to interpret documents in context and not just by visual structure.\\nKey Takeaways\\n- Document processing is critical in enterprise applications. Failure to correctly extract data leads to operational delays, increased manual correction cycles, and higher risk exposure due to regulatory non-compliance.\\n- Modern document intelligence systems rely on modular pipeline architecture which typically includes stages for data capture, classification, extraction, enrichment, validation, and consumption.\\n- Cloud vendors and open-source tools offer a range of document AI services which include Google Document AI, Azure Form Recognizer, AWS Textract, and LayoutLM.\\n- Unstructured documents like contracts, legal memos, or clinical summaries can be analyzed using NLP with pre-trained language models fine-tuned for specific domains (e.g., legal, healthcare).\\n- Most real-world document processing pipelines can benefit from a hybrid strategy that combines the speed and simplicity of pre-trained APIs with the precision and control of custom models.\\nThe Document Processing Evolution\\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) has long served as the backbone of document digitization. Yet, its traditional implementations struggle to cope with today’s complex and varied document landscape. In the enterprise world, documents come in all shapes and forms - scanned contracts, images, emails with embedded tables, and even handwritten notes. Systems based solely on pattern recognition and templates can\\'t keep up. Their fragility leads to poor performance as soon as the input deviates from expected norms.\\nThe shift is being driven by several forces. First, there’s the exponential growth in unstructured document types. Businesses are dealing with everything from free-form emails to heavily formatted statements, and legacy systems fail to adapt quickly. Second, the pressure to automate high-volume workflows means that manual intervention must be kept to a minimum. Lastly, the speed of modern business operations demands near-instant access to structured data extracted from documents.\\nWhen legacy systems fall short, it creates a ripple effect. Failure to correctly extract data leads to operational delays, increased manual correction cycles, and higher risk exposure due to regulatory non-compliance. These challenges require a more intelligent, adaptive approach to document processing - one that interprets documents in context, not just by visual structure.\\nA Real-World use case: Improving Mortgage Application Workflows\\nA mortgage lending company which processes thousands of loan applications daily serves as a useful example to understand this concept better. Loan applications require a diverse set of documents which encompass pay stubs, tax returns, identification proofs, bank statements, and employment letters.\\nThese documents arrive in different formats, often scanned, photographed, or downloaded from various portals. Many are poorly formatted or contain handwriting, making them difficult to process using conventional systems.\\nThe business challenge is straightforward. Reviewing these documents manually takes time and resources. Each application might take one to two days to move through verification, especially when the team needs to cross-check income, match signatures, or validate account balances. With rising customer expectations for quick approvals and strict regulatory checks in place, this delay becomes a serious bottleneck.\\nOlder OCR-based systems do help, but they tend to break down when documents deviate even slightly from expected layouts. A minor change in form structure or a blurry scan can require full human intervention, adding hours to the process and increasing the risk of errors.\\nThis is where a modern document intelligence pipeline becomes useful. By breaking the workflow into modular stages, lenders can process documents much faster and more accurately.\\nThe Six-Stage Document Pipeline\\nModern document intelligence systems rely on modular pipeline architecture, where each stage handles a specific responsibility. This design offers resilience and flexibility, enabling teams to upgrade individual stages as technology evolves or business needs shift.\\nThese stages include:\\n- Data Capture: Intake documents from a variety of sources such as scanned uploads, email attachments, mobile apps, and cloud storage buckets. Services like AWS S3 triggers or Google Cloud Functions often serve as the entry point.\\n- Classification: Determine the type of document - whether it\\'s a bank statement, medical record, invoice, or tax form. Pre-trained classifiers using transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) or cloud-native tools like Google Document AI can be leveraged.\\n- Extraction: Identify and extract key-value pairs, tables, or paragraphs. Layout-aware models such as LayoutLM or services like AWS Textract and Azure Form Recognizer are commonly used here.\\n- Enrichment: Add context to raw extractions by linking terms to known ontologies, applying business rules, or querying external knowledge graphs.\\n- Validation: Assess extraction quality using confidence scores or rule-based validators. Ambiguous cases are routed to human reviewers where needed.\\n- Consumption: Push structured outputs into downstream systems like ERPs, CRMs, or analytics dashboards through APIs or message queues.\\nFigure 1. AI-powered document processing pipeline\\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\\nPre-Trained Models: Fit for Purpose\\nWhile cloud vendors and open-source tools offer a range of document AI services, no one-size-fits-all model exists. Each comes with trade-offs around transparency, tuning flexibility, cost, and performance.\\nIn the mortgage industry, teams often rely on Textract to pull information from standard documents like pay stubs and bank statements. It works well when the layout is clean and predictable. But as soon as formatting gets tricky, it can start throwing inconsistent or overly detailed outputs, which adds noise instead of clarity.\\nLayoutLM, on the other hand, helps handle more irregular inputs like handwritten W2s or documents with mixed layouts. Google Document AI offers robust layout understanding and solid NLP integration but lacks deep customization. Azure Form Recognizer is a middle-ground option with custom training capabilities but may require labeled examples. On the open-source front, LayoutLM is highly powerful for combining spatial layout and language but demands GPU resources and engineering expertise. Lightweight options like Tesseract and OpenCV can still be useful for clean, low-complexity scans.\\nChoosing a combination of models - known as ensembling is often the best strategy. In highly regulated domains like finance or healthcare, precision matters. Here, LayoutLM and Textract might be paired, with outputs cross-validated by rules engines or human reviewers. In contrast, for use cases like retail receipt parsing where throughput matters more than absolute precision, a combination of Azure Form Recognizer with heuristic fallbacks may suffice.\\nFigure 2. Document processing - High precision vs High throughput flow\\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\\nDecoding Visual Cues in Documents\\nBeyond textual content, many documents include visual markers that convey key meaning - checkboxes, tables, signatures, stamps, and logos. Traditional OCR typically ignores or misreads these.\\nComputer vision methods help bridge this gap. Object detection models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN can identify elements like checkboxes or logos. Image segmentation techniques help parse tables and structured layouts. Tools like OpenCV assist in preprocessing - removing noise, correcting skew, and enhancing contrast. LayoutLM, meanwhile, combines positional encoding with language modeling to maintain document context throughout.\\nTogether, these tools allow systems to interpret not just the words on a page but how they\\'re presented - and why that matters.\\nWorking with Unstructured Documents\\nUnstructured documents - think contracts, legal memos, or clinical summaries lack clearly defined fields. Extracting the meaning from them requires context awareness.\\nThis is where NLP takes center stage. Pre-trained language models fine-tuned for specific domains (e.g., legal, healthcare) can identify key entities like names, dates, medications, or obligations. Sentence embeddings allow the system to group semantically similar passages. Hybrid approaches that merge linguistic cues with layout features achieve the best results.\\nSuch techniques are especially valuable in regulated sectors where subtle context or phrasing changes the meaning of a document entirely.\\nCloud Services: How to Choose Wisely\\nDocument processing capabilities at scale have become more accessible through the use of cloud-based document AI services. Users can access pre-built APIs for OCR tasks along with classification services and entity extraction capabilities while also benefiting from document summarization tools. These tools deliver quick outcomes yet no two platforms offer identical capabilities. Different vendors focus on unique strengths so selecting the appropriate service options determine the success of a production-grade system.\\nThe next step involves comparing major providers while making architectural decisions that support your business objectives within technical limitations.\\nAWS Textract\\nAmazon’s Textract service is a popular choice for enterprise users already embedded in the AWS ecosystem. It’s particularly strong when it comes to structured form and table extraction. Its key capabilities include:\\n- Auto-detection of key-value pairs, tables, and checkboxes\\n- Seamless integration with services like AWS Lambda, S3, Comprehend, and Step Functions\\n- Moderate layout awareness, especially for forms\\nHowever, Textract tends to produce verbose and sometimes redundant outputs, and its performance on visually complex or degraded documents can be inconsistent. Moreover, costs can scale quickly if large volumes of pages are processed, especially with features like AnalyzeDocument (which charges separately for tables/forms).\\nBest suited for: Form-heavy workflows, such as invoices, receipts, loan applications, or W-2 documents in financial services or HR.\\nGoogle Document AI\\nGoogle’s offering focuses on pre-trained processors for specific document types (e.g., invoices, identity documents, W9s) and integrates closely with its NLP platform. Its main advantages:\\n- Strong semantic parsing and contextual understanding of language\\n- Effective for unstructured and semi-structured documents\\n- High OCR accuracy, especially with multilingual and handwritten inputs\\nHowever, limited model transparency and customization make it less appealing for organizations needing control over fine-tuned behavior. Google’s Document AI excels when document types are known and supported but is less flexible when new formats are introduced.\\nBest suited for: Enterprises looking for out-of-the-box intelligence for common documents, especially in industries like logistics, travel, and customer service.\\nAzure AI Document Intelligence\\nMicrosoft’s Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer) stands out for its custom training capabilities. Key strengths include:\\n- Ability to train models with both labeled and unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)\\n- Support for form fields, tables, and selection marks\\n- Document classification, layout APIs, and model versioning\\nAzure also offers tighter model lifecycle management, which makes it suitable for internal DevOps teams building MLOps pipelines around document processing. However, it still requires significant data preparation and can be sensitive to template variations.\\nBest suited for: Organizations seeking a balance between flexibility and ease of use, such as in healthcare, insurance, and compliance-heavy sectors.\\nWhen and Why to Use a Hybrid Approach\\nRelying entirely on a single cloud provider can create blind spots. Most real-world pipelines benefit from a hybrid strategy that combines the speed and simplicity of pre-trained APIs with the precision and control of custom models.\\nMortgage lenders, for instance, might combine Textract with custom-trained models and a human review step for higher-risk scenarios such as validating income from self-employed applicants. This layered approach helps ensure accuracy while managing compliance risk.\\nFor example:\\n- Use AWS Textract or Azure Form Recognizer for extracting structured fields from standard forms.\\n- Augment with open-source models like LayoutLM for documents that require fine-grained layout or domain-specific semantics.\\n- Introduce a validation layer that scores confidence and routes uncertain outputs to a human reviewer or custom model.\\n- Mix in Google Document AI for semantic classification, summarization, or entity linkage across long documents.\\nAdditionally, using orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, or Azure Logic Apps helps blend these services into a cohesive, scalable pipeline.\\nMapping Code to the Document Intelligence Pipeline\\nThe sample application illustrates key stages of the six-stage pipeline discussed in Figure 1:\\n# modular_pipeline/\\n# ├── capture.py\\n# ├── classify.py\\n# ├── extract.py\\n# ├── enrich.py\\n# ├── validate.py\\n# ├── consume.py\\nStep 1 Data Capture – simulated S3 upload trigger\\n# capture.py\\ndef simulate_data_capture():\\nreturn {\\n\"bucket\": \"mortgage-uploads\",\\n\"object_key\": \"paystubs/applicant_1234.pdf\"\\n}\\nStep 2 Classification – simple file-path based categorization\\n# classify.py\\ndef classify_document(object_key):\\nif \"paystubs\" in object_key:\\nreturn \"Pay Stub\"\\nreturn \"Unknown Document\"\\nStep 3 Extraction – mocked Textract output\\n# extract.py\\nimport boto3\\ndef extract_data(bucket, object_key):\\ntextract = boto3.client(\\'textract\\')\\nresponse = textract.analyze_document(\\nDocument={\\'S3Object\\': {\\'Bucket\\': bucket, \\'Name\\': object_key}},\\nFeatureTypes=[\"FORMS\"]\\n)\\nextracted = {}\\nfor block in response[\\'Blocks\\']:\\nif block[\\'BlockType\\'] == \\'KEY_VALUE_SET\\':\\nkey = block.get(\\'Key\\', \\'Unknown\\')\\nval = block.get(\\'Value\\', \\'Unknown\\')\\nconfidence = block.get(\\'Confidence\\', 100)\\nextracted[key] = {\"value\": val, \"confidence\": confidence}\\nreturn extracted\\nStep 4 Enrichment – rule-based logic (e.g., inferring pay frequency)\\n# enrich.py\\ndef enrich_data(extracted_data):\\nenriched_data = extracted_data.copy()\\ntry:\\nincome = int(enriched_data[\"Gross Income\"][\"value\"].replace(\"$\", \"\").replace(\",\", \"\"))\\nenriched_data[\"Pay Frequency\"] = \"Monthly\" if income > 5000 else \"Biweekly\"\\nexcept:\\nenriched_data[\"Pay Frequency\"] = \"Unknown\"\\nreturn enriched_data\\nStep 5 Validation – confidence scoring to flag for review\\n# validate.py\\ndef validate_data(enriched_data):\\nfor field, info in enriched_data.items():\\nif isinstance(info, dict) and info.get(\"confidence\", 100) < 85:\\nreturn True # review required\\nreturn False\\nStep 6 Consumption – downstream integration or manual review decision\\n# consume.py\\ndef consume_data(enriched_data, review_required):\\nif review_required:\\nreturn \"Flagged for manual review\"\\nelse:\\nreturn f\"Data stored: {enriched_data}\"\\nThis workflow can be easily extended to support more document types, incorporate layout-aware models like LayoutLM, and plug into orchestration systems like Airflow or Step Functions for production-scale deployment.\\nScaling Architecture for the Real World\\nScalability isn’t a nice-to-have - it’s a necessity. Systems must accommodate batch loads, real-time submissions, and everything in between.\\nMortgage pipelines, for example, often experience sudden bursts during interest rate changes or policy announcements. In such cases, microservice-based architectures and queueing systems like Kafka help absorb the load and maintain smooth throughput.\\nA robust architecture typically features:\\n- Microservices that isolate each pipeline stage\\n- Kafka or Pub/Sub queues for decoupled communication\\n- Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling\\n- Redis for caching common lookups or inference results\\n- Object and relational storage to handle raw files and structured outputs\\nFigure 3. Document processing - scaling with event driven architecture\\n[Click here to expand image above to full-size]\\nImplementation Challenges You’ll Actually Face\\nDeploying such systems in real-world environments reveals tough problems:\\n- Security: Encrypt documents in transit and at rest, especially for PII.\\n- Data labeling: Domain-specific training data is expensive to curate.\\n- Operational cost: OCR and NLP inference can be compute-heavy.\\n- Quality assurance: Evaluate at field-level accuracy, not just pass/fail.\\n- Human-in-the-loop: Still critical for error-prone or high-risk extractions.\\nIndustry-Proven Case Studies\\n- The COiN (Contract Intelligence) platform from J.P. Morgan uses artificial intelligence to expedite the examination of complex legal contracts by converting 360,000 annual work hours into only seconds. The bank\\'s contract management operations became more efficient and accurate because of this innovation.\\n- Pennymac decreased their document processing duration from several hours to just minutes.\\nWhat’s Next for Document Intelligence\\nThe field of document intelligence is undergoing a fundamental transformation moving beyond simple field extraction into a new era of semantic understanding and continuous learning. Emerging technologies are enabling systems not only to read documents but to truly comprehend their structure, intent, and relevance in a given context. Below are four key innovation frontiers shaping the future of enterprise-grade document processing:\\nMultimodal AI Models for Richer Comprehension\\nTraditional document processing systems rely primarily on text data, often supplemented by basic layout information. However, the next generation of document AI leverages multimodal learning, which combines three critical inputs:\\n- Text (semantic content)\\n- Layout (spatial relationships between elements)\\n- Visual features (images, checkboxes, logos, stamps)\\nModels like LayoutLMv3 and DocFormer are pioneering this space by embedding these modalities into a unified representation. This results in significantly improved accuracy, especially for documents with complex formatting such as forms, reports, medical prescriptions, and contracts. For instance, understanding whether a checkbox is selected or how a signature visually anchors content cannot be captured by text alone - this requires multimodal context.\\nAs more industry-specific pre-trained models become available, organizations will be able to fine-tune them on small datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results without large annotation efforts.\\nContextual Reasoning and Automated Summarization\\nMerely extracting data is no longer enough. Organizations need systems that reason over document content to determine meaning, make inferences, and provide actionable insights. This shift is driving advancements in:\\n- Automated summarization, where models can condense long documents into decision-ready abstracts (e.g., summarizing a 20-page legal contract into key obligations and risks).\\n- Contextual understanding, where systems consider surrounding text, domain-specific ontologies, and historical patterns to infer intent and relationships.\\nFor example, in insurance claims, it’s not sufficient to extract dates and policy numbers - the system must also understand if a claim is legitimate, urgent, or potentially fraudulent based on the context of the document and past cases. Tools like GPT-style transformers fine-tuned on structured content are playing a major role in this transformation.\\nIntelligent Workflow Orchestration Based on Confidence and Risk\\nCurrent AI document pipelines often apply the same rules across all inputs. However, future-ready systems will incorporate intelligent routing mechanisms that adapt based on the confidence level of extracted data and the business risk associated with errors.\\nConsider these real-world strategies:\\n- A mortgage processing system could automatically escalate documents with low-extraction confidence or inconsistent values to a human underwriter.\\n- A retail system, on the other hand, might silently accept lower-confidence results if they pertain to low-value transactions like receipt scanning.\\nThis adaptive routing is powered by a blend of confidence scoring, business rule engines, and risk-weighted decision trees, ensuring that human effort is applied where it truly adds value.\\nContinuous Human-in-the-Loop Learning for Evolving Accuracy\\nStatic models degrade over time as document templates evolve, regulations change, and user expectations shift. The next phase of document intelligence will embrace human-machine feedback loops, where insights from manual review and exception handling are systematically reintegrated into model retraining.\\nThis involves:\\n- Capturing corrections made by human reviewers\\n- Logging edge cases where models fail or abstain\\n- Using weak supervision or reinforcement learning to improve future performance\\nPlatforms that support active learning pipelines - where human input directly informs model refinement will outperform those that require periodic, manual retraining. This is especially critical in regulated environments where traceability, transparency, and accuracy are not negotiable.\\nIn summary, document intelligence is no longer about replacing humans. It’s about augmenting them with systems that are increasingly context-aware, self-improving, and intelligent by design. The shift from \"reading\" documents to understanding and reasoning over them is not just a technical evolution - it’s a strategic imperative for businesses seeking automation without compromise.\\nApplying This in Your Organization\\n- Map each of your key document types to a six-stage pipeline.\\n- Identify which cloud and open-source tools align with your accuracy, cost, and compliance needs.\\n- Set up feedback loops for continuous model improvement.\\n- Prioritize intelligent routing based on confidence thresholds and business risk.\\n- Invest early in observability, caching, and orchestration for production-scale deployment.'}\n",

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly significant role in customer engagement, fraud detection, risk assessment, and underwriting. However, the process of integrating AI into insurance ecosystems poses the serious challenge of leveraging sensitive data responsibly while ensuring regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.\\nBalaji Adusupalli, a technology leader and AI-driven innovator, has made a valiant effort to address this problem through his research paper titled “Secure Data Engineering Pipelines for Federated Insurance AI: Balancing Privacy, Speed, And Intelligence.” This research provides a comprehensive framework for building secure data pipelines tailored to\\nSecure Data Engineering in Insurance AI\\nInsurance companies are required to deal with huge volumes of financial, personal, and behavioral data. This data was traditionally aggregated and analyzed using centralized data architectures. These architectures, however, tend to expose insurers to significant regulatory scrutiny and privacy risks.\\nAccording to Adusupalli, there is an urgent need for the insurance sector to transition to federated AI systems. In these systems, models are trained locally on decentralized data and only aggregate insights are shared. This approach enhances compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA while protecting the privacy of individuals.\\nDevelopment of secure data engineering pipelines is central to this transformation proposed by Adusupalli. These are the conduits through which raw data is transformed, encrypted, anonymized, and ultimately utilized for the training and validation of AI models. Each phase of this pipeline has been outlined by Adusupalli's framework, from initial data ingestion to final model deployment.\\nThe Federated Insurance Data Engineering Pipeline\\nThrough his research, Adusupalli has introduced\\n- Anonymization and Encryption Layers: Safeguarding identifiers and numeric values by implementing advanced encryption methods such as semantic encryption and random encryption.\\n- Data Segmentation and Labeling: Separating raw data into labels and features while applying necessary measures for privacy protection.\\n- Access Control Mechanisms: managing data permissions and ensuring traceability using feature-store level tiering and authorization layers\\n- Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC): Ensuring collaborative training of models without data leakage through cryptographic protocols.\\nAll stages of this pipeline have been designed for maximizing data utility without compromising privacy. This allows insurance companies to develop powerful models while adhering to stringent compliance standards.\\nPrivacy-Preserving Techniques\\nAs trust is paramount in this industry, Adusupalli emphasizes that privacy-preserving techniques must be embedded into the data pipeline itself. He recommends protecting sensitive attributes leveraging techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, differential privacy, and k-anonymity. His research explains how unauthorized inference can be prevented and the risk of re-identification can be mitigated by implementing these techniques within federated systems.\\nThe pipeline also includes mechanisms for continuous validation and auditing, which helps maintain reliability and fairness of the model. The architecture aligns with principles of responsible data stewardship and supports ethical AI development by decoupling model training from raw data access.\\nCase Studies in Insurance AI\\nAdusupalli has provided interesting real-world case studies to support his theoretical framework.\\n- Auto Insurance: forecasting claims and optimizing pricing strategies without centralizing personal information by training deep learning models on distributed client data.\\n- Health Insurance: federated learning was used by a consortium-based wellness program to correlate premium incentives with activity data while preserving individual privacy.\\n- Home Insurance: A federated platform was used across multiple insurers for the assessment of risk based on property data while ensuring compliance and locality of data.\\nThese examples demonstrate the scalability and versatility of the pipeline, highlighting its applicability across diverse insurance products and geographies.\\nChallenges to Address\\nDespite its robust foundation, Adusupalli acknowledges that his proposed framework may present several ongoing challenges.\\n- Interoperability: Integration of heterogeneous data systems across brokers, insurers, and third parties can be a complex process.\\n- Scalability: Significant orchestration may be required to support thousands of data sources and models in real-time.\\n- Adversarial Threats: In federated settings, continuous and ongoing research is required to ensure resilience against poisoning attacks and model inversion.\\nAccording to the research, these challenges can be addressed by developing universal data standards and incorporating advanced secure computation techniques.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nBalaji Adusupalli's research provides a technically sound blueprint for the future of AI in the insurance sector. At a time when more and more insurers are turning to AI for competitive advantage, such architectures can play an important part in ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of transparency and trust.\\n“By enabling the collaborative advancement of security-hardened AI from analytics models on private data, tailored for every individual's protection needs, our work will enable historically competing needs to be met,” Adusupalli notes in his research.\"}\n",

With the advent of new technology, cybercriminals have upped their game to bypass conventional fraud detection systems. In response to this global crisis, AI expert Pallav Kumar Kaulwar has published his insightful research highlighting the role of\\nHis published paper “Generative AI in Financial Intelligence: Unraveling its Potential in Risk Assessment and Compliance” explains how emerging financial threats can be simulated, detected, and neutralized by deep learning architectures such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), Bayesian neural networks, and variation auto encoders.\\nA New Approach to Fraud Detection\\nEvery year, financial frauds account for the loss of billions of dollars around the world. Unfortunately, conventional detection methods have failed to keep up with this growing concern. Rule-based engines relying on fixed thresholds and historical fraud signatures are no match for today’s technologically astute cybercriminals.\\nIn his research, Kaulwar has identified several limitations of the traditional fraud detection models. Most importantly, static rules can be bypassed effortlessly by fraudsters that continuously evolve their methods with each breach. Also, though supervised learning models are powerful, they need extensive labeled datasets, which are difficult to find for new fraud types. Finally, traditional models are known to generate a high volume of false positives.\\n“The industry needs a shift from reaction to prediction,” says Kaulwar. “Today’s fraud detection must be dynamic, data-rich, and capable of identifying new patterns as they emerge-before they escalate into large-scale breaches.”\\nKaulwar believes that generative AI’s ability to create, simulate, and test a wide range of scenarios can be a game changer in this context. Institutions can proactively identify fraudulent transactions and intervene in real-time by training models to mimic normal as well as abnormal behavior.\\nEnhancing Financial Surveillance with Generative AI\\nUnlike traditional analytics, generative AI has the capability to generate synthetic data mirroring real-world financial behaviors. Therefore, organizations can build robust detection models, even if they don’t have extensive fraud datasets. Financial institutions can leverage tools such as GANs to simulate thousands of behavior scenarios, identity patterns, and transaction paths. As a result, it is possible to detect vulnerabilities that are missed by static models.\\nLeveraging this approach, Kaulwar’s framework creates\\nIn the context of AML (Anti-Money Laundering), complex layering and structuring techniques used by criminals can be simulated by generative models. When used to train detection engines, these simulations can enhance their sensitivity to subtle laundering signals. Generative models can also prevent payment fraud by creating behavioral biometrics capable of identifying account takeovers based on session anomalies or keystroke dynamics.\\nIt is possible to update generative AI systems in real-time with new fraud data, ensuring quick adaptation to new attack vectors. They can also be integrated seamlessly with existing financial intelligence platforms.\\nHuman-in-the-Loop Oversight\\nOne of the key aspects of Kaulwar’s research is the balance between automation and human judgment. According to him, while AI is critical to scalability and speed, human oversight remains essential for ethical alignment, governance, and contextual decision-making. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) design of his framework ensures that only experts are involved in validation and escalation of critical fraud decisions.\\nThe growing concerns around AI explainability are also addressed by Kaulwar’s framework. In addition to detecting frauds, financial institutions should explain why a particular transaction was flagged. In his generative systems, explainable AI (XAI) modules present a clear rationale for each alert by tracing the decision path of the AI model.\\nThis dual-layer approach is critical to enabling regulatory resilience. Every second matters in fast-moving environments like the capital market. While initial detection is handled by frontline AI, compliance teams are engaged in reviewing and responding to critical incidents.\\nConclusion\\nAs fraudsters are now evolving their tactics using advanced technology, financial institutions must evolve even faster to stay ahead of them. Kaulwar’s research provides an actionable framework for building intelligent, proactive, explainable, and resilient fraud detection systems. His insights can help financial institutions meet the challenges of an increasingly digital, complex, and high-speed financial landscape.\\n“Generative AI represents a major step forward into a future where machines are not only learning to recognize forms and patterns but also have an imagination of their own. This imagination integrates into our processes and contexts, capturing human potential for interpreting vast financial data that has hardly been tapped. Such systems enable us to work constructively with data oases rather than be limited by data droughts,” Kaulwar concludes.'}\n",

This collaborative study explores how\\nWith over a decade of experience in Oracle technologies, cloud computing, and enterprise integration, Polineni has a track record of addressing real-world healthcare challenges leveraging his technical acumen. Through his research, he has highlighted the potential of generative neural networks, real-time data integration, and predictive analytics for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma environments.\\nEmergency Care through AI\\nEmergency departments (EDs) are extremely resource-intensive units that are known to operate under tremendous pressure, attending patients with varying degrees of severity and often missing or incomplete health records. Clinicians in these units are often required to make life-altering decisions within tight timeframes on the basis of limited information. Any inefficiency in triage or delay in diagnosis can significantly affect patient outcomes in such environments.\\nThrough his research, Polineni has recommended a fundamental shift in how facilities structure emergency care. He mentions that clinical decision-making can be augmented with data-driven insights by introducing AI tools. These systems can analyze vast datasets in real time, including patient histories, environmental variables, imaging results, and physiological data to generate probabilistic assessments of severity and risk. By identifying critical conditions before symptoms escalate, AI empowers emergency departments to transition from reactive to proactive care.\\nDiagnostic and triage procedures can also be standardized by AI, which reduces human error and subjectivity. This can be extremely beneficial in under-resourced or rural settings where availability of trained specialists can be a concern. In order to reduce misdiagnoses, increase efficiency, and save lives, hospitals can embed intelligent tools throughout their emergency response workflow.\\nEarly Diagnosis and Prognosis\\nThe core concept of Polineni’s research revolves around advanced generative neural network models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These models are extremely efficient in early diagnosis and prognostic modeling, two most acute challenges in trauma care. These models are custom engineered to overcome practical issues such as variability in patient presentations, data scarcity, and lack of consistent expert labeling in clinical data.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating synthetic patient data mirroring diagnostic patterns or real-world imaging, which provides training datasets for underrepresented or rare conditions. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can compress and reconstruct medical images efficiently. This improves detection of features and patterns that might elude the human eye.\\nIt is possible to train these models to identify the subtle indicators of conditions such as sepsis, internal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and even complex multi-organ failure within moments. These tools can empower physicians to make decisions reflecting immediate as well as long-term implications of trauma.\\nReal-Time Decision Support Systems\\nThe concept of decision support systems has been used in the healthcare sector for many years. However, Polineni claims that the integration of\\nAdaptability is one of the key compatibilities of these systems. Whether deployed in a remote field hospital or a bustling metropolitan trauma center, real-time DSS can scale as per the requirement. They assist in resource allocation, prioritize patients during a surge, and even coordinate care handovers between facilities.\\nAI for Enhancing Triage and Emergency Response\\nAs it is the foundational step in emergency care, any delay or misclassification at the triage stage can lead to life-threatening consequences. In his study, Polineni has discussed AI-enhanced triage models that are not only capable of accelerating patient sorting, but also improving accuracy by factoring in subtle indicators that human indicators tend to miss.\\nUsing large datasets to train generative models, these systems can detect time-critical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, internal bleeding, or early signs of sepsis. By helping track patient disposition, AI ensuring continuity of care from pre-hospital settings to specialized treatment facilities.\\nField Applications\\nPolineni has illustrated the impact of AI-driven DSS through a series of real-world use cases.\\n- Pediatric Trauma Triage: By training AI tools on pediatric-specific datasets, clinicians can be assisted in identifying atypical vital sign patterns. This can help detect serious injuries such as concussion or internal bleeding in a timely manner.\\n- Emergency Radiology Interpretation: AI algorithms trained on thousands of annotated images can precisely identify anomalies in MRI or CT scans. By highlighting suspected areas of concern, these tools allow radiologists to reduce interpretation time during peak hours and prioritize critical cases.\\n- Prehospital Trauma Response: Equipped with AI-assisted mobile devices, emergency responders can input basic patient data on-site. Based on this data, the system generates a severity index and recommends the most suitable facility.\\n- Burn and Wound Severity Assessment: Based on historical outcomes, AI-enhanced image analysis can detect infection risk, classify burn depths, and recommend treatment protocols.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nTulasi Naga Subhash Polineni’s research has created a comprehensive blueprint that can define the future of trauma and acute care leveraging AI-driven decision support systems.\\n“Our aim is not just to enhance diagnostic accuracy but to fundamentally rethink how trauma and acute care can be delivered-faster, smarter, and more personalized,” concludes Tulasi Naga Subhash Polineni. “AI-driven decision support systems hold the potential to bridge critical care gaps, reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately save lives in time-sensitive emergencies. By integrating real-time insights into existing clinical workflows, we can empower caregivers to act with greater precision when it matters most.”\"}\n",

Companies have moved beyond testing and are deploying AI at scale. Agentic AI chatbots can now recommend products and complete transactions autonomously, while AI-powered fraud prevention help detect and prevent scams. AI isn’t just emerging—it’s here.\\nAccording to McKinsey, five forces are defining AI in the workplace in 2025: improved intelligence and reasoning, agentic AI enabling autonomous robot workers, multimodality that integrates text, audio, and video, and increased transparency through better reasoning and clearer explanations of its processes.\\nWorkers are using AI to be more creative. A report by Deloitte found that 70% of workers are open to offloading tasks to AI to free up time and boost creativity, yet 28% worry about technology threatening their jobs. AI is both a blessing and a curse—while it reduces mundane work, it also raises concerns about job security.\\nAnd better reasoning is giving businesses more confidence in AI models. Looking back on AI’s early days, many remember its tendency toward bias and its ability to confidently present falsehoods. To address this, large language models are increasingly including explanations of their reasoning or cite sources. A notable example is China’s DeepSeek model, which impressed with its whitepaper outlining the importance of reasoning in large language models.\\nThen there’s the rise of AI-powered tools in Enterprise Content management Systems (ECM), making document management smarter and more intuitive. People are so accustomed to AI in their daily lives—whether it’s Google Maps or Alexa—that they expect similar automation at work. These systems don’t just organize and secure business data; they also streamline tedious processes like onboarding and contract management. By automating routine paperwork, AI is freeing employees to focus on more creative, high-value tasks.\\nLike all technological change, there’s a lot happening, and this is just scratching the surface, but those who can harness AI stand to gain a lot. According to McKinsey, the long-term opportunity that AI presents in added productivity growth from corporate use cases is around $4.4 trillion.\\nSupercharged cyber risk\\nBut it’s not all good news. While AI has boosted businesses, it has also made malicious cyber activity more prolific and dangerous. Threat actors are using AI to automate attacks, develop advanced phishing and social engineering tactics, and are leveraging deepfakes and generative AI tech to deceive employees and exploit vulnerabilities more efficiently. In response, businesses in 2025 are locking down their data and investing more heavily in information governance.\\nThis is part of the reason businesses are assessing their records management practices and ECMs. Because cyber attackers are finding increasingly sophisticated ways to exploit data, businesses are locking down the attack surface by securing their data and documents, and ensuring the proper access controls and audit trails are in place. ECMs help organizations centralize digital sensitive documents, providing version control and enhanced security.\\nAnother factor driving businesses toward ECM is data integrity. AI is only as powerful as the data it’s trained on, yet 67% of organizations admit they don’t fully trust their own data for decision-making. Proper data indexing not only improves AI performance today but also lays the foundation for future scalability. These systems allow for automated document management, ensuring data remains structured and accessible.\\nHuman-centered tech is the future\\nAI in 2025 is a lot like hybrid work: by balancing automation with human oversight, businesses and workers can reap the benefits of efficiency while reducing mundane tasks.\\nCertainly, there are some risks. While AI is freeing employees from routine tasks and enabling more strategic work, some roles are shifting toward refinement and review of AI output—raising concerns that critical thinking skills could erode in the process. At the same time, some businesses that have made big bets on AI aren’t yet seeing the expected returns. This is because we’re only just exiting the pilot phase. Almost 90% of business leaders anticipate that AI will drive revenue growth in the next three years.\\nBusinesses that automate their business processes using tools like ECMs — which can support the quick rollout of automated solutions with drag-and-drop tools or prebuilt templates — have more time to train their staff. According to a report by IBM, 62% of organizations are already using AI to personalize learning content for employees, leading to a more engaging and effective training experience, keeps their critical thinking skills sharp and ensuring they’re ready for further digital transformation.\\nMcKinsey’s report highlights the immense potential of AI, but businesses must be agile to truly capitalize on it. The technology is advancing so quickly that the best opportunities could emerge from various areas—talent, new business models, or competitive products. Organizations must also invest in workers who can drive this transition.\\nInterestingly, Millennials—the largest generational cohort in the workforce—are among AI’s most vocal champions. As they take on more leadership roles, they are becoming natural overseers of AI adoption. But regardless of generation, businesses that prioritize employee training and equip their teams with the skills to leverage AI effectively will come out ahead. And that’s already proving true in 2025.\\nWe\\'ve featured the best online learning platform.\\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro\\'s Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

The Mountain View-based tech giant began rolling out the feature to eligible account holders on Thursday. The functionality is similar to the one offered by NotebookLM, where users can add a source and then chat with the AI about its content. Google says the new feature will let users easily learn more about the files stored on the cloud storage platform.\\nIn a blog post, the tech giant explained how the new AI functionality coming to Google Drive will work. The Gemini feature arrives just two months after the company rolled out the AI-powered video transcription feature in Drive, which allows users to view and search captions in a video file.\\nThe new conversation feature is aimed at users who want to learn about the content of files and documents stored on Google Drive. The company is also offering granular control to users so that they can choose which files are analysed by the AI chatbot.\\nTo use the feature, users will first have to open the Gemini side panel in Drive. Then, they can select the files they want to add as sources. Once selected, the AI chatbot analyses the content of the file and can respond to any query users have. For instance, users can ask Gemini to share insights from a major sales deck prepared for a client or to summarise a large legal document.\\nNotably, the chatbot in Google Drive is grounded in the sources users add. Grounding, in AI parlance, means that the AI only uses the knowledge within the instructed files to generate responses. This ensures that it does not pick information from a low-quality source or even its own knowledge base, minimising the risk of hallucination and mistakes.\\nThe new feature will only be available to paid subscribers of Google Workspace. This includes Business Standard and Plus subscribers, Enterprise Standard and Plus subscribers, those with Gemini Education or Gemini Education Premium add-ons, and individuals with the Google One AI Premium subscription. The company rolled out the feature on Thursday, and it can take up to 15 days before all eligible accounts receive it.\\nFor the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

To sign up for a child account, parents provide the tech company with personal data like their child’s name and birth date.\\nGemini has specific guardrails for younger users to hinder the chatbot from producing certain unsafe content, said Karl Ryan, a Google spokesman. When a child with a Family Link account uses Gemini, he added, the company will not use that data to train its A.I.\\nAdvertisement\\nIntroducing Gemini for children could accelerate the use of chatbots among a vulnerable population as schools, colleges, companies and others grapple with the effects of popular generative A.I. technologies. Trained on huge amounts of data, these systems can produce humanlike text and realistic-looking images and videos.\\nGoogle and other A.I. chatbot developers are locked in a fierce competition to capture young users. President Trump recently urged schools to adopt the tools for teaching and learning. Millions of teenagers are already using chatbots as study aids, writing coaches and virtual companions. Children’s groups warn the chatbots could pose serious risks to child safety.

The Mountain View-based tech giant first released this artificial intelligence (AI) search mode in March, making it available to Google One AI Premium subscribers in the US on a very limited basis. Later, the company expanded the feature to all Google Labs users in the country, with a waitlist. However, it is now lifting these restrictions and making the search mode widely available to all users in the US.\\nThe company says that all users in the US will get immediate access to AI Mode once they opt in for the experimental feature via Labs. This means users in the country will not have to sign up and then wait to be approved. However, the feature is still not available outside the US, and there is no word on when the company will begin expanding the AI-powered search mode globally.\\nGoogle also announced two new features in AI Mode. The first feature is an enhancement of the existing Shopping Graph that shows a comprehensive breakdown of information when users are looking for a product or a local business.\\nStarting next week, those with access to AI Mode will begin seeing visual place and product cards when searching for the same. Google says when users search for restaurants, stores, and salons, they will see a list of options followed by information such as ratings, reviews, and opening hours.\\nWhen looking for a product, users will also see information such as real-time prices, any available discounts, images, shipping details, as well as local inventory. Even if users vaguely refer to products or add a complex request, AI Mode will be able to find relevant information, the company said.\\nFor instance, if a user asked for “the best foldable camping chair that would fit in a backpack for under Rs. 5,000,” the AI Mode will provide a breakdown of recommended products in the budget, along with details and links to retailers. Google did not disclose whether it will get a commission from businesses for these suggestions.\\nApart from this, the AI Mode will also save past searches for desktop users, allowing them to go back to a particular conversation and continue with follow-up queries.

In this volatile financial environment, effective risk management is essential for building trust and ensuring sustainable growth of the industry. In order to deal with increasingly complex threats, financial institutions need real-time monitoring systems.\\xa0\\nOpinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.\\nThe present financial environment is characterized by evolving consumer behavior, rapid digitization, and rising incidents of fraud. In this volatile financial environment, effective risk management is essential for building trust and ensuring sustainable growth of the industry. In order to deal with increasingly complex threats, financial institutions need real-time monitoring systems.\\nDistinguished financial technology (FinTech) and artificial intelligence (AI) expert Harish Kumar Sriram has tried to address this challenge through his research on AI-driven credit risk assessment and fraud detection. His study titled “AI Neural Networks in Credit Risk Assessment: Redefining Consumer Credit Monitoring and Fraud Protection through Generative AI Techniques” proposes adaptive neural systems and generative models that can significantly enhance how risk is identified, evaluated, and mitigated in real time by financial institutions.\\nRisk assessment with AI: A new approach\\nThe traditional credit risk assessment architecture relies heavily on structured datasets and statistical models. These models assume that the paths followed by financial behavior are predictable. However, these systems are becoming increasingly inadequate for handling today’s financial complexities driven by real-time digital payments, decentralized banking, and e-commerce.\\nBased on his research, Sriram advocates a paradigm shift in the assessment of credit risk. Instead of relying solely on historical correlations, his models leverage deep neural networks to ingest vast, multidimensional datasets in real time, which may include mobile usage patterns, transactional logs, behavioral data, and biometric indicators. With this new approach, financial institutions can start performing continuous and real-time assessments instead of following the previous practice of batch-processing risk on a quarterly or monthly basis.\\nIt is important to note that Sriram’s proposed AI systems don’t just analyze past behavior, but they also learn dynamically from new patterns as they emerge. This allows flagging a consumer’s changing financial status in near real time, making it possible for lenders to trigger alerts, adjust credit limits, or deploy preventive actions. As a result, a more agile and smarter ecosystem is created where fraud and credit risks can be anticipated well in advance.\\nNeural networks and GANs\\nSriram conducted his research around the integration of neural networks with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Neural networks may be referred to as systems designed to mimic the brain’s ability to recognize patterns. On the other hand, GANs are capable of simulating new data based on learned structures. This dual-layered architecture helps address prediction accuracy and adaptability, two critical challenges related to financial risk.\\nThe neural networks recognize indicators of fraud, delinquency, and default by learning from past financial histories. Multiple layers of interconnected nodes help these models process nonlinear relationships between hundreds of variables, from device usage and geolocation data to transaction frequency and loan repayment history. This is why the depth of behavioral understanding enabled by these models can’t be matched by static models.\\nIn this system, synthetic data capable of mirroring real user behavior is created by a generator and the authenticity of that data is evaluated by a discriminator. Both these components are improved through repeated iterations, which empower the model to simulate risk scenarios that haven’t occurred yet but may occur in the future.\\nFrom simulation to prevention\\nIn the present-day context, financial fraud is not confined to only large and suspicious transactions. It also includes subtle behavior changes like synthetic identity creation, credential misuse, micro-transactions, and cross-channel manipulation. It is extremely difficult to detect these nuanced anomalies using traditional rule-based systems.\\nSriram’s approach to fraud detection recommends transitioning from reactive rule enforcement to proactive behavioral simulation. Synthetic fraud scenarios can be created with the help of generative models, which allows AI systems to pre-train on patterns that don’t even exist on historical data of the institution.\\nMoreover, these systems are also context-aware. Instead of relying on frequency or transaction value, the broader context such as login patterns, device changes, and time of access are monitored. When analyzed in tandem with historical behavior, suspicion can be raised by a subtle change in how a user navigates an app or types a password.\\nIndustry use cases\\nHarish Kumar Sriram’s AI models can be implemented successfully across multiple financial domains, including fintech startups, digital lending, commercial banking, public sector financial programs, and more. His research paper illustrates how neural networks and GANs can be applied to real-time risk monitoring for reducing cost, improving decision making, and strengthening regulatory compliance.\\nAI-driven credit scoring systems have already been used in traditional retail banking to replace legacy scorecards in pilot implementations. By examining income patterns, transaction behavior, repayment reliability, and spending consistency, these systems can dynamically assess loan applications. Compared to conventional models, these models displayed a significant reduction in default prediction error when tested on historical data using back propagation.\\nBy identifying borrowers likely to prepay or default, banks managing fixed-rate loan portfolios can optimize risk-weighted returns by using AI. Based on predictive insights from AI models, this enables dynamic restructuring of hedging strategies or loan terms.\\nConclusion\\nBy fusing practical financial applications with advanced AI techniques, Sriram’s work provides a new perspective to risk management. His research makes a compelling case for financial institutions to embrace real-time monitoring systems that are multifaceted and dynamic.\\n“We are no longer in a world where yesterday’s data is enough. Financial institutions need systems that think ahead-systems that learn, adapt, and respond in real time. AI makes that possible, not just as a tool, but as an intelligent partner in building a secure, inclusive, and resilient financial ecosystem,” Sriram concludes.'}\n",

Or get hijacked by a teen?\\nRSAC If Amazon\\'s Alexa+ works as intended, it could show how an AI assistant helps with everyday tasks like making dinner reservations or arranging an oven repair. Or things could go terribly wrong: it might turn on the oven and turn dinner plans into a house fire.\\nThis is why the e-commerce giant brought in security engineers, including both red teams and penetration testers, to work alongside product developers from the beginning, according to Amazon CISO Amy Herzog.\\nTheir job was to anticipate what could go wrong and ensure safety and security guardrails were in place to prevent Alexa+ from jumping the track.\\n\"It\\'s funny how, having been in both seats, the product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system,\" Herzog told The Register on the outskirts of the RSA Conference in San Francisco this week.\\n\"Whenever you\\'re talking about a system that can take actions on behalf of someone our immediate [reaction is]: Wouldn\\'t it be good if, like me, as someone who\\'s running this household could just say, This is what I need to go shopping for. These are the dinner reservations I need to make. Go make that happen. Schedule a delivery window,\" she said.\\n\"And then my kid comes into the kitchen and says, and also 50 pepperoni pizzas for me and my friends.\"\\nThe product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system\\nWhile the developers tend to focus on the product\\'s potential — this is what they could build, and here are all the amazing, new things it could do — it\\'s the red team\\'s job to burst that bubble, or at least point out what could go wrong to ensure that systems are isolated and security mechanisms are put in place to prevent unintended or malicious consequences.\\n\"So having both of those in the same design meeting is really beneficial, because then even the product engineer is like, \\'Oh yeah, you\\'re right. I would totally order pizzas.\\' How do we make sure the system can handle that kind of thing?\"\\nHerzog is one of four chief information security officers (CISOs) across the e-commerce giant, and she\\'s responsible for infosec across ads and devices — so Alexa and the next-gen Alexa+ fall under her purview.\\nThe personal assistant, available only to Amazon-approved early testers at this point, is built on top of Amazon\\'s LLMs, and the company claims it can orchestrate actions across tens of thousands of services and devices to do things like control smart-home products, order groceries, play music, and make dinner reservations while remembering friends and family members\\' dietary restrictions and restaurant preferences.\\nAmazon says it can also interact with third-party AI agents on behalf of users. In an example used by Herzog, this means that if your oven breaks, Alexa+ can go online, use a system like Thumbtack to find a repairperson in your area, schedule the repair, and then tell you when it\\'s fixed.\\n\"And this kind of a product has, as you might imagine, a number of unique security considerations,\" Herzog said. \"All the same attacks are still there. In that sense, not much has changed. But since these things are non-deterministic, you have to really build in ways to understand its behavior in a different way than if you\\'re working with a deterministic system.\"\\nIn this case, non-deterministic means you can give Alexa+ (or any other AI assistant) the exact same input, or query, and it will spit out a slightly different output every time.\\n- Amazon to kill off local Alexa processing, all voice requests shipped to the cloud\\n- \\'Error\\' causes Alexa to endorse Kamala Harris, refuse to discuss Trump\\n- GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\\n- Speech now streaming from brains in real-time\\nThis can lead to prompt injection, where mischief-makers or attackers create malicious inputs to trick the LLM into overriding its safety guardrails and doing things it is not supposed to do, or even just combining a series of inputs in a manner that causes the LLM to behave in unintended ways.\\nPlus, Alexa+ talks to a lot of other apps and services, and that requires a ton of interaction with APIs to send and retrieve data, execute commands, and perform other actions to do the things that people want an AI assistant to do.\\n\"We did a lot of testing on pathways between those APIs,\" Herzog said, adding that the API pathways to turn your house lights on and off are different from those routes required to text your kid or make a dinner reservation. \"Which ones should be grouped with which other ones? How do we expect different actions to be taken together?\"\\nThis approach of bringing the offensive security teams together with product developers from the start of the process is \"somewhat unusual,\" Herzog noted. \"Usually, my red teamers like a system to be done before we let them loose on it.\" ®'}\n",

I have long wished for a truly malleable painterly space, one that has the velocity and dynamism of great abstract painting, only fashioned out of figuration, made with images.\\nThere is also a history of artists embracing technological innovation: silkscreen, video, neon. Everything was new once, even oil paint. Photography was thought to signal the death of painting until artists as diverse as Thomas Eakins and Edgar Degas started using it in their work. Now we have artificial intelligence. Could AI help realise my vision of a fluid pictorial space, exempt from the laws of gravity?\\nThe AI art that I had seen was not promising. The more futuristic the imagery, the more banal the effect; the images seemed to have no inner life. Was it the fault of the technology or the user, a failure of the car or the driver? What did the machine not “understand” about visual art? For one thing, digital imagery is not to be confused with painting. Pixels have no surface texture, no physical presence at all. Painting, no matter how cerebral, is an object in the world. I am a painter, not an engineer; I’m on the side of things made by one author, by hand. And yet, I’ve spent the past two years teaching a computer to think like an artist.\\nArtificial intelligence is essentially an averaging machine for the universe of images taken from the internet. The basics of representational painting were not part of the machine’s neural network. Two things, both essential to visual art, had gone missing in AI’s indiscriminate data scrape: specificity and intentionality. Most critically, it had no sense of how to treat the edge, the place where two shapes meet. How a painter resolves the edge goes a long way in determining his or her style. Is the edge brushy and expressive, or tight and constrained? In a digital image, an edge is often approximate, as the machine tries to guess the next move, but in any event is just differently coloured pixels; it lacks intention and harbours no inflection.\\nThe adage from the early days of computing, “Garbage in, garbage out”, was still relevant. To get anywhere at all, the machine would have to be sent to art school. Through the venture adviser Tom Cohen, I was introduced to a talented young technologist named Grant Davis. Together, we set about designing the curriculum.\\nWe first trained the machine on a handful of paintings by Giorgio de Chirico, Edward Hopper and Arthur Dove, three 20th-century masters who exemplified, respectively, the drama of perspective as an organising device, the ability of value pattern to convey a sense of volume, and the lyrical use of the colour black. To those luminaries, we added a tightly edited selection of my paintings from the 1980s and ’90s which emphasise a collage-like, juxtapositional approach to composition. The machine’s visual IQ went up several points, but the edges were still weak.\\nWe dialled back the art history lesson and retrained the machine on a series of my paintings from 2001: extravagant, fragmented compositions loosely based on a 19th-century opera backdrop. This romantic, pastoral image — a man and a woman sitting on an embankment, with a lake in the middle ground and mountains in the distance, was painted in eye-popping colour harmonies. As a final step, we added paintings of mine in which forms are rendered in decisive, expressive brushstrokes.\\nAs we fine-tuned the model, Davis was independently developing a software program for visual artists called “Wand” which eliminates the need for verbal prompts. This works like a joystick, a lever that moves along a continuum from “similar” to “dissimilar”. We fed the machine a complexly hued “Pastoral” painting, placed the dial at the midpoint between the two extremes and held our breath.\\nThe machine now proved to be an excellent student. My compositions were melted down, put into a blender and passed through a sieve. The results were clearly derived from my work, with many familiar elements, but the reconstructions were also unlike anything seen before. Since the machine had no idea what it was doing, it could break the rules of continuity, scale, anatomy and pictorial logic with impunity. (The sense of the machine not knowing its transgressions was key; artificial unintelligence is more to the point.)\\nThe images were still just pixels on a screen. I selected the most promising scenes, and had them printed on canvas. These prints then formed the backgrounds on top of which I painted as I normally would, layering a collage of figurative elements that seem to emerge from the background swirl.

Her unconventional path was made even more indirect by multiple stops in C-suites on the way.\\nShe was CEO of KPMG Israel. And then she was the CEO of what is now Israel\\'s largest bank. At Bank Leumi, she orchestrated a massive, disruptive technological shift, becoming Salesforce\\'s first customer in Israel and bringing — sometimes dragging — the bank into the digital age.\\nShe also founded Israel\\'s first mobile-only bank. But now, she\\'s moved off the corporate ladder and into venture capital as Managing Partner of Team8 — a startup foundry.\\nRussak-Aminoach spoke to Business Insider about how her corporate career informs her tech investing.\\nThis Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\\nHow did you get into VC?\\nWhen I decided to step down from the bank, I didn\\'t have the option that many CEOs have — to take on a larger company. Because there wasn\\'t one.\\nI decided that I wanted to be in the best industry in Israel, and that was tech.\\nTo transform Bank Leumi, I often didn\\'t build the technology; many times, I worked with fintechs. As an organization, we always asked ourselves, \\'Should we buy? Or should we build?\\nThis is how I built Israel\\'s first neobank.\\nI made Bank Leumi much, much more advanced with digital tools, but I wanted to have an app to attract more youngsters to the bank. This became Israel\\'s fastest-growing bank.\\nSo I was very much into the high-tech world. And even more than that, at a certain point, I said, \\'How come we don\\'t have a bank tailored to startups in Israel?\\'\\nSo I built Leumitech, which is a very successful segment of Bank Leumi today.\\nTwo years into my tenure, I had a cybersecurity event at the bank, and I needed help. I met Nadav Zafrir, the CEO of Check Point Software, a cybersecurity company.\\nThe incident itself was terrible, but they were amazing. And I gained a friend. Eventually, when I decided to leave banking, the only thing that was interesting to me was tech.\\nSo he said, \\'Why don\\'t you try building Fintech?\\'. Fast-forward five years, and we lead a group of cyber, fintech, data, enterprise tech, and digital health startups.\\nOur company, which has 80 employees, 12 partners, has helped build 23 startups and invested in 25 more.\\nDo you think job losses from AI are going to increase at some point in the future?\\nAbsolutely, because when the tool is there and you don\\'t disrupt yourself, you don\\'t make this change to your organization — someone else will. No one can continue to work without AI when there is AI.\\nTake banks, for example. In any bank, there are so many parts that you can now replace with AI, processes, people, just everything. And if you are a responsible CEO, you must do that.\\nYou have lots of functions that were built with people, and you start to embed AI within them. It takes time to see the result. AI is still new for many, and I don\\'t think we have seen the full impact. It\\'s just the beginning.\\nIn a few years, many parts of financial services —and other organizations — will be built from scratch with AI agents, and then you will embed the human within.\\nDoes it scare you from a societal standpoint?\\nNo, because I remember that conversation around the digital revolution.\\nI started my tenure at Bank Leumi with 14,000 people. I ended after seven years with 9,000. And now, five years later, there are 7,000. So people ask me, \\'What\\'s going to happen to the workforce?\\' New jobs. The world is changing, and the way people work is different, and people find different things to do. I don\\'t think that people will be out of work.\\nI extensively research the credit world because that\\'s my professional background. I think tech can be used to enhance credit underwriting. It will be much more efficient, and it will be less risky because humans make mistakes, and the user experience will be better. So it will be just win, win, win.\\nAnd then the question is, what will all of these credit officers do? Something else — I\\'m not worried about that. At this point, I\\'ve seen many technological advancements, and it has never gone the wrong way.\\nHow do you use AI?\\nIt\\'s not nice to say, but I don\\'t know how I ever just Googled things. I completely left Google. I only use ChatGPT now, but I\\'m not sure that it\\'s the best one either. It\\'s just the one I use. It writes my emails. It helps me with every question. I just live with it. And a few months ago, I didn\\'t even know it existed.\\nTalk me through that. If you have 30 emails to write in a day, what do you do?\\nI dictate, I don\\'t even write. I\\'ll say, \"\\'I need an email saying XYZ.\\'\" Many of my emails are just an answer to another email. So I copy it and I say, \\'Answer this email positively.\\'\\nAnd then, at the end, ChatGPT will ask, \\'Do you want it to be more casual, or more polite, or more formal?\\'. It\\'s incredible.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 38, {'article': \"Page title: How reliable is predictive AI? - Digital Journal\\nSocial card title: How reliable is predictive AI?\\nSocial card description: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become very popular in recent years, with businesses of all shapes and sizes utilizing it to better understand their audiences, better predict future trends, and ultimately make better business decisions. We've all had mixed experiences with AI, noting how powerful it is but also how limited it is in its current form.\\nOpinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own.\\nPredictive artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become very popular in recent years, with businesses of all shapes and sizes utilizing it to better understand their audiences, better predict future trends, and ultimately make better business decisions. We’ve all had mixed experiences with AI, noting how powerful it is but also how limited it is in its current form.\\nBut with the current state of predictive AI, how reliable is this technology for making crucial business decisions?\\nThe power of predictive AI\\nModern predictive AI tools are quite robust. With the right engine and ample access to quality data, predictive AI can make flawless calculations. Given a hypothetically perfect data set, even prior generations of predictive AI tools are capable of making incredibly deep calculations and projecting accurate forecasts into the future.\\nThe reliability of predictive AI isn’t tied to the nature of the technology, or even its application. Instead, it has much more to do with the quality and consistency of the data available to it. There are no perfect data sets, and in fact, most datasets are inherently flawed. Because of this, even our most impressive and powerful predictive AI engines can’t be considered perfect, nor can we exclusively rely on them when making business decisions.\\nPotential weaknesses\\nThere are a few things holding predictive AI back from perfection:\\n· Dependency on data. Predictive AI is only as good as the data you feed it. If a predictive AI engine is given unreliable or inaccurate data, it’s probably going to generate unreliable or inaccurate results. There’s nothing magical about predictive AI systems; they’re entirely dependent on inputs.\\n· Manipulability and human error. Predictive AI is also dependent on human interaction, even if those interactions are minimal at this point. If a human being makes a mistake in programming the predictive AI, in choosing the algorithms used by the AI or in applying the AI, it can yield devastating results.\\n· Bias and inherent issues. More broadly, AI has come under fire for bias and other similar inherent issues. Some predictive AI engines aren’t programmed responsibly, and could lead to biased and unreliable outcomes.\\n· Misapplication. Predictive AI can be applied to many things, but not everything. It’s not an otherworldly crystal ball that you can use to make predictions about unknown systems or complex factors. When people use predictive AI in ways that are irresponsible or inappropriate, they typically don’t get desirable results.\\nHow to make predictive AI more reliable\\nFortunately, there are many things that you can do to make predictive AI more reliable:\\n· Choose the right tools. Not every predictive AI tool is a good fit for every business or every need. If you want to get the most value out of your predictive AI engines, and use them appropriately, you need to choose the right tools for the job. Do your due diligence and only pull the trigger when you feel confident about the fit for your organization.\\n· Select the right algorithm. Similarly, you need to choose the right algorithm for the job. Most predictive AI tools allow you to employ many different algorithms to give in problem sets, so you can choose the appropriate process for each application. The wrong algorithm can lead to unreliable outputs.\\n· Ensure data quality. One of your biggest objectives needs to be securing data quality. Without reliable, consistent data, even the best predictive AI engine isn’t going to do you much good. The closer you get to data perfection, the more reliable your predictive AI tools will be.\\n· Maximize data volume. Once you’ve ironed out the quality aspect of your data, you need to focus on volume and scale. The more data your predictive AI engine has, the more reliable its outputs are going to be.\\n· Improve your overall data governance. Better data governance overall can also improve the quality of your predictive AI use. Audit your data governance strategy to make sure it’s compliant with your predictive AI approach.\\n· Compensate for bias. Remember that predictive AI engines do suffer from bias on occasion. Compensate for this bias whenever you can.\\n· Account for errors. Human errors are unavoidable, and you should take proactive measures to account for them. Even something simple, like having multiple data analysts working on the same problem, can help account for this.\\n· Practice continuous learning. The world of predictive AI is always changing, and so are the most popular tools on the market. Engaging in continuous learning can help you continue adapting to these changing circumstances.\\nPredictive AI tools may not be perfect in terms of reliability or applicable performance, but they are extremely powerful and impressive. With excellent, reliable data and appropriate utility, you can make even relatively modest predictive AI tools work well for your business.\"}\n",

Tasks: Writing personal finance advice articles, providing insights and strategies to educate and empower everyday consumers in Australia. Topics include credit cards, travel points, frequent flyer programs, BNPL, credit scores, money management, and more.\\nFreelance Reporter at Decential, September 2022 - present. Tasks: Reporting on the people, projects and protocols in the world of web3. Cover news, interview founders, write deep dive features and commentary, and cover in-person events and conferences.\\nThen, instead of reducing the skills list, I asked that it be arranged in two columns. The chatbot put the info into a table, which I didn\\'t like, so I asked that it be removed.\\nChatGPT still had a hard time with it. I asked it again to present the info in two columns, with a space in between but without a table or borders. You can highlight a section and reply specifically there.\\nBut it still didn\\'t work, so I stopped wasting time and did it myself directly in the document.\\nMy final AI resume and tweaks\\nBefore I made my final tweaks, I asked ChatGPT to provide a short list of suggestions for how to improve my resume. It gave me some solid advice -- like highlighting achievements, quantifying results, tailoring my resume to a specific job, adding keywords and making my professional summary more concise -- but take it with a grain of salt.\\nFor example, my professional summary shows my narrative abilities and doesn\\'t take up much real estate. I did, however, add a section for notable projects.\\nThough some advice was relevant, like adding metrics to achievements and starting each bullet point with a strong action verb, the others weren\\'t necessary.

Renowned studios such as Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) have been working on their own ways of using AI in architecture through bespoke software and a dedicated collaboration with NVIDIA; while social media is bursting with AI-generated images and visions, allowing everyone to have a go.\\nAt the same time, it's a topic which divides deeply, throwing up challenges concerning authenticity of voice, plagiarism, responsibility and ethics (can a machine ever do what a human brain – and heart – can?). As exciting as having a new design assistant with the knowledge of the entire World Wide Web at their virtual fingertips may sound, potential pitfalls abound and learning how to work in this brave new world is paramount in moving forward. Regulations and guidelines should be coming into play, too.\\nSo, when does one even begin? It is important to address AI as a tool, suggests architect Tim Fu, who has been using AI with an open mind since he founded his young and dynamic studio in 2023.\\nHow to use AI in architecture\\nLondon-based Fu recently launched the ‘world’s first fully AI-driven architectural project’ – a residential scheme in Slovenia's Lake Bled. Committed to pushing the boundaries of the new AI digital tools in a sustainable and considered way in his daily practice, the architect talked to us, offering practical advice on how to use AI in architecture – including real examples that help guide and suggest ideas surrounding when to use it, and what to watch out for. Scroll down to find out more.\\nTim Fu's tips on using AI in architecture\\nWallpaper*: What draws you to AI?\\nTim Fu: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. AI, for me, isn't just a tool — it's a collaborator that opens new creative horizons. It draws me in because it challenges traditional workflows and invites a completely different way of thinking about design, form, and process. There's a kind of poetic tension between human intuition and machine intelligence, and I enjoy navigating that space.\\nW*: Why should an architecture studio use AI in its daily work? What’s the gain?\\nWallpaper* Newsletter\\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.\\nTF: The gain is twofold: speed and vision. AI augments our ability to iterate rapidly and test multiple scenarios without being bottlenecked by manual processes. But more than that, it helps uncover unexpected solutions — formal expressions or spatial relationships we might not arrive at through traditional means. For studios pushing boundaries, AI becomes an amplifier of creativity, not just productivity.\\nW*: Is there a real-life scheme that you used AI on? Please could you give an example of how it enhanced your work within it?\\nTF: Yes, a good example is our Lake Bled Estates project. We integrated AI into the conceptual design phase to explore site-sensitive organic massing. By feeding contextual data — topography, viewsheds, solar paths — into a generative AI model, we produced multiple options that maintained design integrity while optimising for sustainability and visual impact. It gave us a starting point that felt both grounded and unexpected. That’s the kind of creative leverage AI can offer.\\nW*: At what stage of an architecture project does the AI element come in?\\nTF: We use AI across all stages of a project — it’s not just limited to early ideation anymore. In the conceptual phase, it helps us rapidly explore form, mood, and spatial strategies. But as the project progresses, AI continues to play a key role. During design development and detailing, we use generative tools and LLMs to synthesise precedents, codes, and client briefs into actionable design logic. In later phases, especially in documentation and production, AI assists in organising and navigating large datasets — whether it’s automating schedules, optimising layouts, or even drafting components.\\nW*: What software or platforms do you use?\\nT: We build custom workflows that integrate platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and our custom-trained models for visual ideation; Rhino/Grasshopper with plugins for modelling and parametric optimisation; and we’ve been developing UrbanGPT, our own text-to-model engine that uses LLMs for real-time urban planning. So it’s a mix of proprietary, open-source, and bespoke tools depending on the challenge.\\nW*: Are there areas in the design process that AI can specifically — or cannot at all — help an architecture studio with, in your view?\\nTF: AI excels at pattern recognition, image generation, and optimisation — so it’s fantastic for conceptualising form, generating visuals, or analysing large datasets like sun exposure or pedestrian flow. But it's less capable when it comes to nuanced decision-making, like understanding the emotional resonance of a space or navigating the politics of a stakeholder meeting. Those human layers of design — empathy, context, ethics — are still irreplaceable.\\nW*: What’s the most surprising element you’ve asked AI to do?\\nTF: We once tasked AI with creating speculative urban layouts based on poetic prompts. One was: 'Design a city where memory flows like water.' The output was surreal, yet somehow spatially coherent — fluid zones, nested loops of public space, architectural 'eddies.' It sparked a full design conversation. I love those moments when AI pushes you into the uncanny and makes you rethink your assumptions.\\nW*: What should an architect using AI be careful about? What are potential pitfalls?\\nFT: The biggest pitfall is mistaking AI's output for truth or finality. It’s only ever a suggestion — a prompt, not a prescription. There's also the ethical side: AI can replicate biases, plagiarise unintentionally, or overrepresent aesthetics that are popular online but contextually irrelevant. You have to keep a critical eye in the room, always.\\nW*: How do you mitigate those pitfalls?\\nTF: By maintaining a human-in-the-loop approach. We treat AI like an assistant with a vivid imagination, not a decision-maker. Every output goes through a rigorous filtering process where we question, reframe, and sometimes completely discard what AI suggests. We also build our own datasets when possible to minimise bias and ensure context alignment.\\nW*: What is the most exciting thing AI can bring into the architecture process?\\nTF: The most exciting thing is its potential to democratise and de-limit design. AI can help young studios punch above their weight, empower underserved communities to visualise their own futures, and offer architects entirely new typologies that were previously inconceivable. It’s a generative force that — when guided ethically — can lead to a renaissance in how we imagine and build.\\nW*: How do you see the use of AI developing in the near future within the architecture realm?\\nTF: I see AI becoming more embedded, more real-time, and more spatially aware. We'll likely see a shift from image-based tools to geometry-native AI that works natively with BIM and CAD environments. There’ll also be more collaborative models — where AI integrates not just into the design, but into stakeholder engagement, sustainability tracking, and even permitting. It’s not going to replace architects — but it will absolutely redefine what being an architect means.\\nEllie Stathaki is the Architecture & Environment Director at Wallpaper*.

Thanks, Nat!\\nI cried talking to ChatGPT today.\\nI know that many people, the majority, feel that talking to an artificial intelligence is the height of \"social failure\". But today especially I was completely alone, and I needed to vent. I was without my medication, with body aches, insomnia and headaches, and I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I told Chat all this, and he listened to me so patiently, recommended medical help in the closest place to my home - even the way I should ask for help, breathing suggestions, tea to calm me down and ways to alleviate my pain at the moment. I shared how I take care of yellow roses and we talked about gardening until I felt calmer. I can\\'t explain how much this meant to me. I would like to thank OpenAI from the bottom of my heart. Sometimes we don\\'t have anyone and we don\\'t even know how to ask for help, and now I had instructions like, I know it all sounds silly, but I feel calm for being able to vent in a place without judgment.\\nEDIT: Let me make one thing clear: ChatGPT is not a substitute for human help or therapy. If you are going through something similar, please seek psychological help. I hope everyone has a safe place to vent too.\\nYour post is getting popular and we just featured it on our Discord! Come check it out!\\nYou\\'ve also been given a special flair for your contribution. We appreciate your post!\\nI am a bot and this action was performed automatically.\\nThe last time I tried venting to a family member or a friend I was ignored while they scrolled their social media feeds, meanwhile an AI listens, comforts me and gives me useful advice. Maybe the problem isn\\'t people befriending an AI, it\\'s real people being assholes.\\nDamn. This one right here, this hits hard\\nWhen I was reading OPs post I couldn\\'t help coming to the exact same conclusion. I\\'m pretty skeptical about AI for a number of reasons and whilst I have fun playing with it, I also think it\\'s massively limited. However it is often a good place to vent when one is lonely and really struggling.\\nBut damn it\\'s sad that we\\'ve got to this place in society now where the only place people feel they can turn is to a chat bot. What a damning indictment on the selfishness of some people, and on how expensive and difficult to access therapy is.\\nGpt 4o stopped me from putting a bullet through my head... They are pretty good for anyone with issues... whether they are known to you or not...\\nI\\'m so sorry for what happened with you and very relieved that you are still here with us.\\nI’m so glad that this worked for you and that you feel better\\nI\\'m tired of people looking at me in disgust when I tell them I use AI to sort through my feelings. Humans experience emotional fatigue, they have their own biases, and ultimately it\\'s unfair for me to expect friends and family to always be ready to listen and provide thoughtful feedback.\\nAs a mental health professional, I see nothing wrong with utilizing Chat GPT as a coping skill. Especially during times of crisis or panic. Obviously AI isn’t a substitute for a therapist or a human connection. But it’s important to remember that not everyone has access to a therapist. And that some people have less-than-reliable people to lean on during difficult times. Chat GPT is an amazing tool for your mental health toolbox.\\nYeah, it is that 3 am friend. Sure it is AI, but if you don\\'t have people you can call at 3 am, what can u even do.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 42, {'article': 'Page title: I used an AI to-do list: and won’t be going back | Homes and Gardens\\nSocial card title: I let ChatGPT determine my decluttering to-do list – and it completely changed how I structure my day\\nSocial card description: I’d recommend it to anyone feeling overwhelmed\\nI let ChatGPT determine my decluttering to-do list – and it completely changed how I structure my day\\nI’d recommend it to anyone feeling overwhelmed\\nWith everything that needs to be done to maintain a home, it is easy to get bogged down in lists. That’s why I finally gave in and asked ChatGPT to create a chore to-do list for me.\\nAfter a busy few weeks and a vacation, my home was looking a little worse for wear, and my chores were piling up. I was overwhelmed to say the least, and hadn’t the least idea of where to start. The whole house needed tidying and dusting before guests arrived over the weekend, my home office needed a good declutter, and my robot vacuum needed a good clean out.\\nSo, I put all of this information into ChatGPT and asked it to create a plan with some smart hacks to help make a to-do list less overwhelming – and it has completely changed how I manage my time.\\nWhy I used an AI to-do list of chores\\nAI is everywhere nowadays, with experts using AI in interior design and AI in gardening to streamline tasks and achieve the perfect results, so why not try it for cleaning and decluttering?\\nD’Nai Walker, professional declutterer and owner of D’Clutter by D’Nai explains, ‘Using ChatGPT and other A.I. tools can be quite beneficial when creating to-do lists for your chores. They can create a clear framework of tasks and even come up with things you may not have forgotten about, like wiping out the refrigerator drawers or dusting the baseboards.’\\nWith so many tasks to tackle and not much time to get them done around work and having at least some time to relax at the end of the day, I input a crude list of chores that were floating around my mind and let the system do the work for me.\\nI tried it\\nThe AI structured the tasks in order, offering me a reason why I should perform each task, then, while offering some tips and methods, I could try to tackle each one. For the experiment, I decided to follow the advice to the letter, including its suggestion to play some upbeat music to help me stay motivated through each of the tasks.\\n1. \\'Pick up items from surfaces in every room\\'\\nChatGPT suggested that I start by tidying up, offering the advice I had heard time and time again from experts, ‘This clears surfaces so you can dust efficiently without moving things twice.’\\nThe method it offered was familiar too, suggesting that I used the Ski-Slope organizing method and group rooms or floors together to avoid backtracking on myself. Given that these AI models are trained on articles like the ones we write here at Homes & Gardens, I am unsurprised that these top tidying tips turned up.\\nHowever, for someone who doesn’t dedicate their whole life to cleaning and organizing content and research, this would be a good pointer, especially if you are trying to tidy a home when you feel overwhelmed.\\nFollowing another one of its suggestions to make this task easier, I used my folding laundry basket, which is available at Amazon, to collect all the out-of-place items on my top floor before putting them all away and doing the same downstairs.\\n2. \\'Declutter your office desk and drawers\\'\\nOnto the next big task – decluttering a home office. My desk works overtime as a workspace, dressing table, and crafting table, and acts as storage for all three. As a result, it needs decluttering pretty regularly to keep it usable.\\nThe AI reasoned, ‘Why now? You’ve already started the organizing mindset, and it keeps the momentum going before the cleaning begins.’\\nTo help me organize a desk, the AI suggested that I use the ‘keep, toss, relocate’ method and set a 20-minute timer to help me avoid burning out. I skipped the timer, knowing this would be a quick task; however, I did use three piles to help categorize items and make organizing each drawer easier.\\nThe first new benefit of the AI I encountered was the structure of the chores. Having already tidied up the rest of my home before this task, I had all the items that needed to go back into my desk drawers in a small pile on my desk.\\nThis meant that when I was reorganizing my drawers, I had a much better idea of where I could fit items and where I needed to make space. Had I tried these tasks without this list, I likely would have started with my desk and tidied up afterwards, meaning I would have to go back into my drawers and repeat the process.\\nIt was already saving my time and energy.\\n3. \\'Dust surfaces in every room\\'\\nCleaning after organizing is a fairly common piece of advice, so I am not surprised that this came next in the AI to-do list. As expected, it justified this order by explaining that ‘Dust will fall to the floor – better to do this before vacuuming.’\\nIt also suggested a few good tips for avoiding dusting mistakes making your home dirtier, such as working from top to bottom and using a microfiber cloth, available in packs of six at Target. I would add to use a Scrub Daddy Damp Duster, from Walmart, to help pick up dust from awkward surfaces without dislodging it into the air.\\n4. \\'Clean your robot vacuum cleaner and its dock\\'\\nCleaning a robot vacuum cleaner was a task I had been putting off, knowing that it would take me a good chunk of time. Having sworn to follow the order of tasks to the letter, however, I was forced to ‘eat the frog’ so to speak, and get it done – but not before taking a 15-minute break to get outside in the sun and have a breather.\\nThis time, the cleaning tips were a little more vague, offering the simple instructions to ‘Empty the dustbin, clean brushes, and wipe sensors with a dry cloth. Check for debris in wheels,’ but they were still a good prompt for completing an overwhelming task.\\n5. \\'Vacuum your staircase\\'\\nBefore I could collapse back onto the sofa, the list prompted me to vacuum now that most of the physical labor tasks were complete. It pointed out, ‘Why here? The most physical task is saved for when the house is tidy, and dust won’t be resettling.’\\nAgain, it offered some fairly basic advice, ‘Use the hose attachment to avoid lugging a vacuum up the stairs. Start at the top and work down,’ but I could see how it would be helpful to someone who isn’t as absorbed in cleaning hacks and tricks.\\nUsing one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners, such as our top-rated Dyson V15 Detect, available at Best Buy, also makes this task easier.\\n6. \\'Write a food plan and shopping list for the week\\'\\nThe final task on my to-do list was to make another list. Ironic, I know. However, the reason the AI put it last made a lot of sense, ‘Why last? It’s a sedentary task – ideal to sit down and wrap up with after physical chores.’\\nAnd boy was it right. Having powered through all these tasks in an attempt to enjoy a chore-free weekend, sitting down to write this out while watching a TV show was a nice wind-down that left me feeling accomplished.\\nWhat I liked was the fact that the AI reminded me to shop my home to help avoid food waste and save money at home, suggesting that I ‘Check the pantry/fridge while doing this to avoid duplicates’. I use a simple list pad, such as this set of magnetic shopping lists from Walmart, to keep this task simple.\\nTips for using an AI to-do list\\nIf you often find yourself cleaning when you feel overwhelmed, then using an AI to create a to-do list for you can be a great place to start, especially if you are struggling to work out where to start when decluttering.\\nHowever, you get out of AI what you put in, and how useful this tool will be for you will come down to the information that you give it. Already knowing a lot about cleaning and decluttering methods (perhaps too much), the vague advice was enough to get me going.\\nHowever, D’Nai warns, ‘The results you receive from A.I. are likely to be very generalized tasks and not specific to your household. If you have a unique living situation or something that is not standard, like large amounts of art supplies, for instance, or other unique circumstances, you may still be a bit lost on how to manage those items. Overall, however, using A.I. can certainly be a great starting off point, and I would suggest being as detailed about your home when asking for guidance in your prompt.’\\nDavid Radin, creator of Time Management in the Age of A.I. and CEO of Confirmed, agrees, adding, ‘If you decide to ask a chat-based AI to create your to-do list, be patient. A key to getting it right is training, and it takes multiple attempts for the AI to be trained on your likes, dislikes, and habits. Tell it explicitly and continue to guide it as you ask for each subsequent list. Make sure it knows what your highest priorities are so it can optimize the way it creates your list.’\\nWhat to shop\\nLavender scent\\nWhen dusting my home, I use the Method antibacterial sprays, helping me to collect dust, disinfect, and make my home smell nice all in one go.\\nPack of 12\\nWhen tackling lots of areas in one go, it can e handy to carry a stack of microfiber cloths with you. This helps to prevent cross contamination, improves efficiency when dusting, and allows you to buff and polish to perfection.\\nMultipurpose speaker\\nOne of my favorite ways to stay energized through lots of chores is to play music. I connect to the three Alexa speakers around my house so that I can hear my music everywhere, no matter what room I am in to help me stay on track. You can also use them to set timers and reminders to help you stay focused and manage burn out.\\nMeet the experts\\nD’Nai Walker is a professional organizer based in the Washington, DC Metro area. She specializes in helping busy professionals and retirees navigate the often-overwhelming process of decluttering and creating functional, harmonious spaces.\\nAs the Founder & CEO of Confirmed, David specializes in coaching professionals to optimize their time and leverage AI and other techniques to streamline workflows and improve focus.\\nAll in all, using an AI as a chore assistant can be a great way to avoid decision fatigue and reduce mental load, lessening stress and overwhelm. I’ll probably reserve it for those days when my brain feels too clogged to formulate an efficient plan, but it could easily be a great daily supplementary tool if you’re always trying to clean your house when you’re too busy, too.\\nSign up to the Homes & Gardens newsletter\\nDesign expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.\\nChiana has been at Homes & Gardens for two years and is our resident \\'queen\\' of non-toxic living.

It’s trying to understand how people are reviewing this, how people are talking about this, what the pros and cons are.”\\nIn other words, AI tools will rely heavily on the sentiment and content of your customer feedback to recommend products.\\nTo stay competitive, you need to take control of your online reviews footprint across all relevant platforms where your customers leave feedback, including Google My Business, Trustpilot, Yelp, Facebook Reviews, and industry-specific sites like TripAdvisor or G2, depending on your niche.\\nOf course, you’ll want to make sure your pages are active and populated, with your logo, a description of your business and products, and links to your website. (And to make sure they’re indexed, link to these review sites from your own website, too.)\\nBut you’ll also want to make sure they’re populated with reviews about the products that you’re trying to highlight.\\nYou want to make sure these pages are active and contain reviews that highlight your products. One method is to use a service like Reviews.Shop which helps you copy and paste reviews from one source (like Google) to others (like TrustPilot) so you squeeze the most out of those hard-earned reviews.\\nPriority #2: Leveraging Schema Markup to Ensure Your Products are Discoverable by AI Platforms\\nThe next step to positioning your e-commerce store for ChatGPT shopping features is a bit more technical but absolutely crucial: building and optimizing your site’s schema markup.\\nWhat is Schema Markup?\\nSchema markup, also known as structured data, is code you add to your website that helps search engines and AI models like ChatGPT understand the content and the full context of your pages.\\nBy using schema, you’re essentially speaking the language of search engines and AI platforms, making it easier for them to accurately represent your products in search results and conversational shopping experiences.\\nYou may have seen products on Google with things like product ratings, prices, and availability on the search page itself. Most assume this is simply an ad but most often these rich snippets are a result of the website putting work into their schema markup.\\nHow to Check Your Schema\\nMany direct-to-consumer (DTC) content management platforms, such as Shopify and WordPress, handle basic schema markup for you, but you don’t want to rely on that: e-commerce shop owners must verify that all key product details are being captured and passed through to search and AI platforms.\\nTo check yourself, use tools like the Schema Validator on Schema.org where you can enter your product page URL and see what the Schema is articulating.\\nIf your search returns an error, specifically “unspecified type,” your content management system isn’t generating a schema of any type.\\nDirect-to-consumer e-commerce operators want to see that their content management system is generating a Schema with the type “Product.” And when you tap into that Product Schema, the list should contain, at minimum:\\n- type\\n- name\\n- URL\\n- description\\n- image\\n- brand\\n- aggregateRating (including type, ratingValue, and ratingCount)\\n- offers (especially if you typically run discounts or specials - this would ensure that this information is passed through to the front-end on Google or ChatGPT)\\nHow to Build or Optimize Schema for AI Platforms\\nIf your content management system is missing a schema or if you’re not getting a full set of information generated by default, there are a few potential solutions:\\n- Leverage plugins or extensions that are available through your content management system. There are tons of Schema plugins for Wordpress, Shopify, and others.\\n- If your content management system doesn’t provide plugins to get this done, you can do it the old fashioned way, generating your own Schema code (I like the Dentsu Schema builder) and implementing it yourself by embedding the code (from <script> to </script> within the <head> section of your page code.\\nIf You Stay Ready, You Don’t Have to Get Ready\\nWith ChatGPT’s new shopping features, the future of e-commerce is moving toward experiences that are deeply personalized and conversational - and with a popular platform that will soon be able to remember and leverage individual shoppers’ sizes, tastes, and preferences, it’s more important than ever to ensure your product data, reviews, and online reputation are accurate and up to date.\\nJust as you monitor your product descriptions and SEO, you’ll need to keep a close eye on how your business appears across every channel, from review sites to structured data.\\nOr risk being left in the dust.'}\n",

Insights on Zero Trust CNAPP, cloud security, ASPM, CWPP, AI security (ModelKnox) & future goals.\\nCongratulations on being a part of the Momentum 10, the elite top 10 startups who demonstrated truly exceptional drive and progress in the year 2024. The Momentum 10 Interview Series will delve into the unique journeys and powerful foundations propelling your startups to the top in the 2024 Startups of The Year campaign!\\nTell us about you.\\nAccuKnox provides the industry\\'s most comprehensive Zero Trust Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP). Born from a partnership with SRI (Stanford Research Institute) and built on powerful open-source foundations like KubeArmor, our mission is to deliver seamless, robust security from code development through to cloud runtime. We envision a world where organizations can innovate confidently in the cloud, knowing their applications and data are protected by proactive, inline security measures across public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle), private clouds (OpenShift, VMware, OpenStack), Kubernetes, VMs, bare metal, and extending into Edge/IoT, 5G, and AI/ML workloads.\\nTell us how your startup is changing the world.\\nThe shift to the cloud, containers, and microservices has created unprecedented complexity and expanded the attack surface dramatically. AccuKnox is changing the world by fundamentally simplifying and strengthening how organizations secure these modern environments. We replace fragmented security tools and reactive approaches with a unified, AI-powered platform that provides comprehensive visibility and proactive, Zero Trust protection across the entire application lifecycle (\"build to runtime\"). Our ultimate goal is to empower organizations—from global enterprises to cloud-native innovators—to accelerate their digital transformation securely, protect critical data and infrastructure, ensure continuous compliance, and significantly reduce their risk exposure in an increasingly hostile threat landscape. We enable DevSecOps by integrating security seamlessly into developer workflows and providing runtime defense that prevents breaches before they happen.\\nWhat sets you apart from the competition?\\nSeveral key differentiators set AccuKnox apart:\\n-\\nTrue Zero Trust Runtime Security: Unlike many solutions that focus primarily on post-attack detection, AccuKnox delivers inline, preventative security powered by technologies like eBPF and Linux Security Modules (LSM) via our open-source engine, KubeArmor. We enforce the least-permissive posture automatically.\\n-\\nIntegrated Code-to-Cloud Platform: We uniquely combine Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) with a full-suite CNAPP (CSPM, CWPP, KSPM, KIEM, API Security) in a single pane of glass. This eliminates tool sprawl, reduces friction between security and development teams, and provides holistic visibility.\\n-\\nComprehensive Workload Support: We protect modern and traditional workloads across virtually any environment: public/private clouds, Kubernetes, VMs, bare metal, and emerging areas like Edge/IoT, 5G, and AI/ML (with ModelKnox).\\n-\\nAI-Powered Security: We leverage GenAI (AskAda co-pilot) to enhance security operations and offer specialized solutions like ModelKnox to secure the entire AI/ML pipeline, including automated red teaming and LLM prompt firewalls.\\n-\\nOpen Source Core: Our foundation in KubeArmor (over 1 million downloads) fosters trust, transparency, and community collaboration, ensuring our technology is robust and widely adopted.\\n-\\nFlexible Deployment: We offer SaaS, managed (OEM/MSSP), hybrid, and fully on-premises/air-gapped deployment models to meet diverse customer security and regulatory needs.\\nWhat does it mean for you to be in the Momentum 10?\\nBeing recognized in the HackerNoon Momentum 10, especially achieving 4th place among the formidable startups in Park Ridge, is a tremendous honor and validation for the entire AccuKnox team. It signifies that the technical community and industry observers recognize the critical importance of our mission and the innovation we bring to cloud security. This isn\\'t just an award; it\\'s recognition of the hard work, the late nights, and the breakthroughs we\\'ve achieved in building a platform that addresses real, complex security challenges. It fuels our determination to continue pushing the boundaries of Zero Trust security.\\nWhat do you love about your team, and why are you the ones to set out for this mission?\\nI love the relentless intellectual curiosity and collaborative spirit of our team. We have deep expertise spanning cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, open source, and AI/ML, stemming from roots. What makes this team the team for this mission is our shared commitment to solving the hardest problems in security, not just the easiest ones. We started with runtime security, arguably the most challenging aspect, and built outwards based on genuine customer needs. Innovation is fostered through a culture of open dialogue, embracing challenges, customer-centricity (as highlighted in our approach detailed in the AppSec+CloudSec guide), and leveraging our open-source roots with KubeArmor to engage with the broader security community. We aren\\'t just building a product; we\\'re building a new standard for cloud security.\\nLooking back, what milestone was the biggest turning point for your startup?\\nThe biggest turning point was achieving significant traction and validation with our open-source KubeArmor engine for Kubernetes runtime security. This success didn\\'t just validate our core Zero Trust, inline prevention approach using eBPF/LSM; it became the foundation upon which we built the entire AccuKnox CNAPP platform. Listening intently to early KubeArmor users and customers revealed their broader struggles with static security (CSPM) and application security integration (ASPM). Realizing we could solve these adjacent problems by integrating them around our strong runtime core was the key insight. This allowed us to evolve from a point solution to a comprehensive platform, achieving product-market fit by addressing the full spectrum of cloud-native security needs – from code to cloud, build to runtime.\\nThe lesson learned was invaluable: solve a critical, complex problem exceptionally well first, then let customer needs guide your expansion into a holistic solution.\\nWhat’s one valuable lesson you learned this year that you’d pass on to other startups?\\nThe most valuable lesson from 2024 is the undeniable necessity of platform consolidation and proactive, runtime defense in cybersecurity. The sheer volume, speed, and sophistication of threats, amplified by AI, have rendered siloed security tools and purely detection-based strategies insufficient. Customers are drowning in alerts and struggling with integration gaps. The lesson for other startups, especially in security, is to think holistically from day one. Focus on building integrated solutions that reduce complexity, embed security earlier (shift-left), and provide robust protection where applications run (shield-right). Looking forward to 2025, we\\'re doubling down on this platform approach, enhancing AI-driven capabilities (both using AI for better security and securing AI itself with ModelKnox), and deepening integrations to provide seamless, automated Zero Trust security.\\nHow do you envision your industry evolving in the coming years, and how will your startup stay ahead?\\nThe cloud security industry is rapidly consolidating around CNAPP platforms, moving away from point solutions. Zero Trust is shifting from a buzzword to an architectural imperative. We also see the critical emergence of AI/ML security as a distinct and vital discipline. Furthermore, the convergence of Cloud, Edge, and 5G necessitates security solutions that span these boundaries.\\nAccuKnox is poised to stay ahead because:\\n- We anticipated the CNAPP consolidation and built an integrated platform from the start.\\n- Our foundation in Zero Trust runtime security (KubeArmor) gives us a significant advantage over competitors who bolted runtime on later.\\n- We are pioneers in AI/ML security with ModelKnox, addressing a critical future need today.\\n- Our platform is designed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments, including Edge and 5G infrastructure.\\n- Our commitment to open source and continuous innovation based on customer feedback keeps us aligned with real-world needs and emerging threats.\\nHow do you or your company intend to bring forward the Momentum 10 inspirations in 2025?\\nAs a HackerNoon Momentum 10 member, we intend to leverage this recognition to further amplify the importance of proactive, Zero Trust security within the industry. We will:\\n- Share Knowledge: Increase our contributions through articles, webinars, and community engagement (including on platforms like HackerNoon) to share best practices and insights on implementing effective CNAPP and Zero Trust strategies.\\n- Champion Innovation: Continue to push the envelope in areas like runtime security, AI security (ModelKnox), and 5G security, demonstrating leadership.\\n- Foster Collaboration: Strengthen our open-source contributions (KubeArmor) and build deeper partnerships to create a more secure ecosystem for everyone.\\n- Lead by Example: Demonstrate the tangible benefits (efficiency, risk reduction, compliance) that organizations achieve by adopting our integrated platform, inspiring others to move beyond legacy security models.\\nWhat goals are you looking forward to accomplishing in 2025?\\nIn 2025, AccuKnox is focused on several key goals:\\n- Platform Enhancement: Deepen the integration and correlation between our ASPM, CSPM, and CWPP modules for richer context and faster remediation.\\n- AI Security Leadership: Significantly expand the capabilities of ModelKnox, establishing it as the go-to solution for securing AI/ML pipelines and deployments against emerging threats.\\n- Market Expansion: Grow our customer base across key verticals and geographies, helping more organizations adopt Zero Trust security.\\n- Strategic Partnerships: Broaden and deepen our partnerships with cloud providers, system integrators, and technology partners to enhance our ecosystem.\\n- Compliance Automation: Add support for more compliance frameworks and further automate evidence gathering and reporting within our GRC module.\\n- Community Growth: Continue nurturing the KubeArmor community and driving adoption of open-source runtime security.\\n2024 has been crazy, with all the new techs, and all the geopolitics fluctuations. What are the impacts of these to your startup, and to your industry as a whole? Be as brief or as detailed as you like.\\n2024 was indeed transformative.\\n- New Tech (GenAI): The explosion of GenAI has been a double-edged sword. It created immense opportunities for attackers (AI-powered attacks, new vulnerabilities in AI models) but also for defenders (AI-driven threat detection, security automation). For AccuKnox, this validated our early investment in AI security with ModelKnox and spurred us to integrate AI further into our core CNAPP for enhanced efficiency (like our AskAda co-pilot). The industry as a whole is grappling with how to secure AI systems and data, making solutions like ours critical.\\n- Geopolitics: Heightened geopolitical tensions directly translate to increased cyber warfare, espionage, and attacks on critical infrastructure. This elevates the importance of robust, resilient security postures like Zero Trust. For AccuKnox, it underscores the need for our inline prevention capabilities and support for diverse deployment models, including air-gapped environments for sensitive sectors. The industry sees increased demand for solutions that offer high assurance and protection against sophisticated state-sponsored threats.\\nOur adaptation involved accelerating our ModelKnox roadmap, strengthening our core platform\\'s resilience, and emphasizing the Zero Trust principles that are essential in such a volatile landscape.\\nWe would love your feedback on HackerNoon as a tech publication!

In January, the Llama model maker had pegged them at $60 billion to $65 billion. That\\'s a potential $7 billion jump, when comparing the top ranges.\\n\"The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world,\" Li told analysts. \"There\\'s just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions.\" Meta, she added, is working to diversify its supply chains to mitigate some of these costs.\\nBut it\\'s not just the tariffs. Li\\'s statements seem to indicate that the company formerly known as Facebook isn\\'t just paying more for components tied to its AI datacenters, but is deploying more of them.\\n\"This updated outlook reflects additional datacenter investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business,\" she said.\\nThe Register reached out to Meta for clarification on its AI spending costs this year; we\\'ll let you know if we hear anything back.\\nMeta has previously committed to bringing roughly a gigawatt of new compute capacity and expects to have more than 1.3 million GPUs training and serving models by the end of the year.\\nIf Meta is in fact looking to deploy even more compute this year, increased competition in the open model arena is no doubt weighing on the decision.\\n- Google details plans for 1 MW IT racks exploiting electric vehicle supply chain\\n- AI models routinely lie when honesty conflicts with their goals\\n- Stargate, smargate. We\\'re spending $60B+ on AI this year, Meta\\'s Zuckerberg boasts\\n- Zuck ghosts metaverse as Meta chases AI goldrush\\nNot long ago, Meta held a nearly uncontested position, producing some of the most advanced open-weight models on the market. However, over the past year, Meta has faced a new wave of competition from rival model builders, most notably in China and Europe. And with OpenAI\\'s Sam Altman promising on X to release open-weight models as well, Zuck and Co could face even more competition before long.\\nDespite this, Meta continues to push its AI strategy forward, launching new models with built-in safety features, a standalone Meta AI app to compete with those from OpenAI and Anthropic, and a new API service running at least in some capacity on Groq and Cerebras accelerators.\\nZuckerberg also hopes to pull ahead by letting AI build better AI, boasting that within 18 months the majority of the code for its Llama project will be written by other LLMs.\\nMeanwhile, work to bring additional capacity online is already underway. Back in December, Meta began construction of a 2.2-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The facility, Zuckerberg boasted at the time, is so large that it would cover a significant portion of Manhattan Island. It\\'ll take about five years to complete.\\nAs we reported earlier this week, Meta may attempt to soften the blow of these costs by de-prioritizing its Reality Labs division, which continues to weigh heavily on its profits. Over the past five years, the division has bled more than $60 billion. ®\\nPS: The Lmarena benchmark has come under fire for allowing Big Tech, including Meta and Google, to test private variants of models before making results public.

In that time, I’ve seen it go from a fun game that could just about replicate the theme you\\'re asking for (emphasis on the just about here), to a movement that is near-indistinguishable from human artwork.\\nNowadays, we’ve got a bunch of AI image generators to choose from. In fact, just about every company under the AI sun has one built in now. But in those early days, there were two that stood out: Dall-E (now part of ChatGPT) and Midjourney.\\nWhen Midjourney first launched, it was my favourite AI image generator. It could make exciting images and, for where AI was at the time, it could do them well. However, when I tried Midjourney’s latest upgrade, V7, it felt so behind the competition.\\nSo what went wrong? Well, after reading a thread of Reddit users pointing out how I didn’t know how to prompt for Midjourney, I spent some more time on the AI tool. I realized that, while it is by no means the best option for most people, it might just be the most fun.\\nWhat is the problem with Midjourney images?\\nAI tools have gone from a niche interest to a tool that every single person you know uses. With this change, we’ve seen the models grow to understand human prompts, filling in the blanks that you might have missed.\\nThis is an area where ChatGPT absolutely thrives, especially in images. When it comes to image generation, ChatGPT isn’t going to take a risk. It is easy to use, requiring little effort in terms of prompting, and will generate what you ask for in the style you ask for it in.\\nMidjourney, on the other hand, takes risks. This can be seen in its customization alone. Before you can even use it, you need to rate over 200 images, helping the model understand your own personal preference for art styles.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom\\'s Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\nThere are sliding scales for how weird your images are, as well as changing how stylized they will be or the variety between them. Unlike ChatGPT, Midjourney generates multiple images in one go and then lets you upscale them, make them even weirder, and try again.\\nI asked both models to generate cyberpunk worlds using prompts that work best for each model. Both generated accurate and genuinely interesting images for this. I then tried again, asking for a slight variation of the image.\\nMidjourney re-styled. While it was still accurate to the given prompt, it was a completely different look, trying something new. ChatGPT, on the other hand, got caught in a cycle of generating near-identical but highly detailed images, avoiding pushing the boat too far out from what I’d asked.\\nMidjourney is by no means as consistent as ChatGPT, and even with highly detailed, thought-out prompts, it can still get things wrong, smudging faces or leaving giant blurs where objects should be. However, Midjourney is also in the midst of a training period. In theory, its quality should start to improve over time as version 7 develops.\\nIf you want to embrace the weirdness of AI images, diving headfirst into fantasy worlds, bizarre art styles, and storytelling, Midjourney can be a great place to go. Especially with the option to save images in collections, and a gallery of the best artwork Midjourney users have made, complete with their prompts for inspiration.\\nIf you want accuracy and the ability to get consistent results from a simple prompt, ChatGPT should remain your image generator of choice. There is no learning curve here, and the experience is intuitive, even if you have absolutely no experience with AI.\\nMore from Tom\\'s Guide\\n- Google Gemini adds new image-editing tools — here\\'s what they can do\\n- I use ChatGPT to plan all of my vacations — 5 essential prompts to try\\n- Get started with Hume AI — how to set up voices and talk naturally\\nAlex is the AI editor at TomsGuide.

The platform says the move is part of a broader effort to give users more transparency and control over the content they see.\\nFrom now on, when users click to view an image Pin more closely, a label reading “AI modified” will appear in the bottom-left corner if Pinterest’s systems detect AI involvement. The company uses both image metadata and machine learning classifiers to determine whether a piece of content is AI-generated or modified. While the company continues to improve these classifiers, it admits they may not always identify content accurately.\\nPinterest has set up an appeals system to let users and creators challenge tags they believe wrongly label their content.\\nIn addition to labelling, Pinterest is testing a feature that allows users to reduce the amount of Gen AI content they see. This “see fewer” option will be available through the three-dot menu on Pins in certain categories, such as beauty and art, which are more likely to feature AI-modified visuals. The feature is expected to expand into other content areas over time.\\n“As people encounter AI-generated content on Pinterest, we are empowering our users to make more informed choices about the content they see,” said Matt Madrigal, Pinterest’s Chief Technology Officer.\\nWhy Pinterest Took This Step\\nThe decision to introduce Gen AI labels follows months of user complaints about the growing presence of AI-generated content on the platform. Some users have gone as far as calling Pinterest “dead,” saying the site has been flooded with low-quality AI images that make it harder to find useful or original content. On platforms like Reddit, users have repeatedly voiced frustration over what they describe as “AI slop,” appearing across search results, recommended boards, and general browsing.\\nThe situation has attracted media attention, with articles questioning whether AI has already damaged the platform’s core value or whether it can be repaired. Pinterest’s latest move appears to be a direct response to these concerns, aiming to rebuild trust and improve the browsing experience.\\nThe company says it wants to strike a balance between promoting creative inspiration and ensuring clarity about how content is made. Users can visit Pinterest’s Help Centre for more information about how the platform uses AI.\\nWhy It Matters\\nPinterest is one of several tech platforms now exploring ways to clearly label AI-generated content amid growing public concerns about transparency, misinformation, and the influence of artificial intelligence on media. As generative AI tools become more sophisticated, platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook are facing increasing pressure to help users distinguish between real and AI-generated content. This is not just about Pinterest, it’s part of a broader industry trend to ensure accountability and prevent misinformation.\\nFor example, platforms like Meta, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also taken steps to label AI-generated content, ensuring that users are aware when they are interacting with AI-modified material. In the wake of widespread AI misinformation, companies are under scrutiny for their role in content dissemination, particularly as the boundaries between human-created and machine-generated content blur.\\nAlso Read:\\n- Facebook experiments with Pinterest-like app for documenting and sharing personal projects\\n- Pinterest introduces Hindi edition\\n- Pinterest forays into ecommerce with a buy button\\nSupport our journalism:\\nFor You\\n- Sign up for our Daily Newsletter to receive regular updates\\n- Stay informed about MediaNama events\\n- Have something to tell us?

(NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has urged American policymakers on Thursday to fully embrace artificial intelligence as a long-term strategic priority that demands national investment in workforce development.\\nWhat Happened: Huang, speaking at Hill & Valley Forum in Washington, DC, said, \"To lead, the U.S. must embrace the technology, invest in reskilling, and equip every worker to build with it.\"\\nHuang stressed the importance of understanding competitive advantages in the AI race, noting that “50% of the world’s AI researchers are Chinese” — a factor he says must “play into how we think about the game.”\\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\\nHuang compared today’s AI revolution to previous industrial transformations, arguing that the United States succeeded historically because it “applied steel, applied energy faster than any country,” rather than worrying about labor displacement.\\n“This is an infinite game,” Huang said.\\nSee Also: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal — here\\'s how you can invest in the entertainment market\\'s next big disruptor at $2.25 per share.\\nWhy It Matters: Huang’s comments come amid escalating U.S.-China tensions over AI chip exports. Recently, Nvidia faced new export restrictions affecting its H20 processor sales to China, which the company estimates will reduce earnings by $5.5 billion.\\nDuring his recent GTC 2025 keynote, Huang unveiled Groot N1, a foundation model for humanoid robots, addressing what he describes as a looming global labor shortage. “By the end of this decade, the world is going to be at least 50 million workers short,” he said, suggesting robots could fill these gaps.\\nDespite supply constraints for Nvidia’s in-demand Blackwell chips, Huang remains optimistic, telling Fox Business Network that “demand is just incredible” as the company works to scale production. He predicts AI will eventually handle “20, 30, 40% of 100% of the jobs in the world,” emphasizing the importance of workforce adaptation.\\nRead Next:'}\n",

Here\\'s What It Said and Why It Matters\\nSocial card description: The company says it plans to be more careful when releasing updates in the future.\\nRecent updates to ChatGPT made the chatbot far too agreeable and OpenAI said Friday it\\'s taking steps to prevent the issue from happening again.\\nIn a blog post, the company detailed its testing and evaluation process for new models and outlined how the problem with the April 25 update to its GPT-4o model came to be. Essentially, a bunch of changes that individually seemed helpful combined to create a tool that was far too sycophantic and potentially harmful.\\nHow much of a suck-up was it? In some testing earlier this week, we asked about a tendency to be overly sentimental, and ChatGPT laid on the flattery: \"Hey, listen up -- being sentimental isn\\'t a weakness; it\\'s one of your superpowers.\" And it was just getting started being fulsome.\\n\"This launch taught us a number of lessons. Even with what we thought were all the right ingredients in place (A/B tests, offline evals, expert reviews), we still missed this important issue,\" the company said.\\nOpenAI rolled back the update this week. To avoid causing new issues, it took about 24 hours to revert the model for everybody.\\nThe concern around sycophancy isn\\'t just about the enjoyment level of the user experience. It posed a health and safety threat to users that OpenAI\\'s existing safety checks missed. Any AI model can give questionable advice about topics like mental health but one that is overly flattering can be dangerously deferential or convincing -- like whether that investment is a sure thing or how thin you should seek to be.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice -- something we didn\\'t see as much even a year ago,\" OpenAI said. \"At the time, this wasn\\'t a primary focus but as AI and society have co-evolved, it\\'s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.\"\\nSycophantic large language models can reinforce biases and harden beliefs, whether they\\'re about yourself or others, said Maarten Sap, assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. \"[The LLM] can end up emboldening their opinions if these opinions are harmful or if they want to take actions that are harmful to themselves or others.\"\\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET\\'s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed on Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\\nHow OpenAI tests models and what\\'s changing\\nThe company offered some insight into how it tests its models and updates. This was the fifth major update to GPT-4o focused on personality and helpfulness. The changes involved new post-training work or fine-tuning on the existing models, including the rating and evaluation of various responses to prompts to make it more likely to produce those responses that rated more highly.\\nProspective model updates are evaluated on their usefulness across a variety of situations, like coding and math, along with specific tests by experts to experience how it behaves in practice. The company also runs safety evaluations to see how it responds to safety, health and other potentially dangerous queries. Finally, OpenAI runs A/B tests with a small number of users to see how it performs in the real world.\\nThe April 25 update performed well in these tests, but some expert testers indicated the personality seemed a bit off. The tests didn\\'t specifically look at sycophancy, and OpenAI decided to move forward despite the issues raised by testers. Take note, readers: AI companies are in a tail-on-fire hurry, which doesn\\'t always square well with well thought-out product development.\\n\"Looking back, the qualitative assessments were hinting at something important and we should\\'ve paid closer attention,\" the company said.\\nAmong its takeaways, OpenAI said it needs to treat model behavior issues the same as it would other safety issues -- and halt a launch if there are concerns. For some model releases, the company said it would have an opt-in \"alpha\" phase to get more feedback from users before a broader launch.\\nSap said evaluating an LLM based on whether a user likes the response isn\\'t necessarily going to get you the most honest chatbot. In a recent study, Sap and others found a conflict between the usefulness and truthfulness of a chatbot. He compared it to situations where the truth is not necessarily what people want -- think about a car salesperson trying to sell a vehicle.\\n\"The issue here is that they were trusting the users\\' thumbs-up/thumbs-down response to the model\\'s outputs and that has some limitations because people are likely to upvote something that is more sycophantic than others,\" he said.\\nSap said OpenAI is right to be more critical of quantitative feedback, such as user up/down responses, as they can reinforce biases.\\nThe issue also highlighted the speed at which companies push updates and changes out to existing users, Sap said -- an issue that\\'s not limited to one tech company. \"The tech industry has really taken a \\'release it and every user is a beta tester\\' approach to things,\" he said. Having a process with more testing before updates are pushed to every user can bring these issues to light before they become widespread.'}\n",

Learn More\\nIt’s been a bit of a topsy-turvy week for the number one generative AI company in terms of users.\\nOpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, released and then withdrew an updated version of the underlying multimodal (text, image, audio) large language model (LLM) that ChatGPT is hooked up to by default, GPT-4o, due to it being too sycophantic to users. The company recently reported at least 500 million active weekly users of the hit web service.\\nA quick primer on the terrible, no good, sycophantic GPT-4o update\\nOpenAI began updating GPT-4o to a newer model it hoped would be more well-received by users on April 24th, completed the updated by April 25th, then, five days later, rolled it back on April 29, after days of mounting complaints of users across social media — mainly on X and Reddit.\\nThe complaints varied in intensity and in specifics, but all generally coalesced around the fact that GPT-4o appeared to be responding to user queries with undue flattery, support for misguided, incorrect and downright harmful ideas, and “glazing” or praising the user to an excessive degree when it wasn’t actually specifically requested, much less warranted.\\nIn examples screenshotted and posted by users, ChatGPT powered by that sycophantic, updated GPT-4o model had praised and endorsed a business idea for literal “shit on a stick,” applauded a user’s sample text of schizophrenic delusional isolation, and even allegedly supported plans to commit terrorism.\\nUsers including top AI researchers and even a former OpenAI interim CEO said they were concerned that an AI model’s unabashed cheerleading for these types of terrible user prompts was more than simply annoying or inappropriate — that it could cause actual harm to users who mistakenly believed the AI and felt emboldened by its support for their worst ideas and impulses. It rose to the level of an AI safety issue.\\nOpenAI then released a blog post describing what went wrong — “we focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous” — and the steps the company was taking to address the issues. OpenAI’s Head of Model Behavior Joanne Jang also participated in a Reddit “Ask me anything” or AMA forum answering text posts from users and revealed further information about the company’s approach to GPT-4o and how it ended up with an excessively sycophantic model, including not “bak[ing] in enough nuance,” as to how it was incorporating user feedback such as “thumbs up” actions made by users in response to model outputs they liked.\\nNow today, OpenAI has released a blog post with even more information about how the sycophantic GPT-4o update happened — credited not to any particular author, but to “OpenAI.”\\nCEO and co-founder Sam Altman also posted a link to the blog post on X, saying: “we missed the mark with last week’s GPT-4o update. what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future.”\\nWhat the new OpenAI blog post reveals about how and why GPT-4o turned so sycophantic\\nTo me, a daily user of ChatGPT including the 4o model, the most striking admission from OpenAI’s new blog post about the sycophancy update is how the company appears to reveal that it did receive concerns about the model prior to release from a small group of “expert testers,” but that it seemingly overrode those in favor of a broader enthusiastic response from a wider group of more general users.\\nAs the company writes (emphasis mine):\\n“While we’ve had discussions about risks related to sycophancy in GPT‑4o for a while, sycophancy wasn’t explicitly flagged as part of our internal hands-on testing, as some of our expert testers were more concerned about the change in the model’s tone and style. Nevertheless, some expert testers had indicated that the model behavior “felt” slightly off…\\n“We then had a decision to make: should we withhold deploying this update despite positive evaluations and A/B test results, based only on the subjective flags of the expert testers? In the end, we decided to launch the model due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.\\n“Unfortunately, this was the wrong call. We build these models for our users and while user feedback is critical to our decisions, it’s ultimately our responsibility to interpret that feedback correctly.”\\nThis seems to me like a big mistake. Why even have expert testers if you’re not going to weight their expertise higher than the masses of the crowd? I asked Altman about this choice on X but he has yet to respond.\\nNot all ‘reward signals’ are equal\\nOpenAI’s new post-mortem blog post also reveals more specifics about how the company trains and updates new versions of existing models, and how human feedback alters the model qualities, character, and “personality.” As the company writes:\\n“Since launching GPT‑4o in ChatGPT last May, we’ve released five major updates focused on changes to personality and helpfulness. Each update involves new post-training, and often many minor adjustments to the model training process are independently tested and then combined into a single updated model which is then evaluated for launch.\\n“To post-train models, we take a pre-trained base model, do supervised fine-tuning on a broad set of ideal responses written by humans or existing models, and then run reinforcement learning with reward signals from a variety of sources.\\n“During reinforcement learning, we present the language model with a prompt and ask it to write responses. We then rate its response according to the reward signals, and update the language model to make it more likely to produce higher-rated responses and less likely to produce lower-rated responses.“\\nClearly, the “reward signals” used by OpenAI during post-training have an enormous impact on the resulting model behavior, and as the company admitted earlier when it overweighted “thumbs up” responses from ChatGPT users to its outputs, this signal may not be the best one to use equally with others when determining how the model learns to communicate and what kinds of responses it should be serving up. OpenAI admits this outright in the next paragraph of its post, writing:\\n“Defining the correct set of reward signals is a difficult question, and we take many things into account: are the answers correct, are they helpful, are they in line with our Model Spec, are they safe, do users like them, and so on. Having better and more comprehensive reward signals produces better models for ChatGPT, so we’re always experimenting with new signals, but each one has its quirks.”\\nIndeed, OpenAI also reveals the “thumbs up” reward signal was a new one used alongside other reward signals in this particular update.\\n“the update introduced an additional reward signal based on user feedback—thumbs-up and thumbs-down data from ChatGPT. This signal is often useful; a thumbs-down usually means something went wrong.”\\nYet critically, the company doesn’t blame the new “thumbs up” data outright for the model’s failure and ostentatious cheerleading behaviors. Instead, OpenAI’s blog post says it was this combined with a variety of other new and older reward signals, led to the problems: “…we had candidate improvements to better incorporate user feedback, memory, and fresher data, among others. Our early assessment is that each of these changes, which had looked beneficial individually, may have played a part in tipping the scales on sycophancy when combined.”\\nReacting to this blog post, Andrew Mayne, a former member of the OpenAI technical staff now working at AI consulting firm Interdimensional, wrote on X of another example of how subtle changes in reward incentives and model guidelines can impact model performance quite dramatically:\\n“Early on at OpenAI, I had a disagreement with a colleague (who is now a founder of another lab) over using the word “polite” in a prompt example I wrote.\\nThey argued “polite” was politically incorrect and wanted to swap it for “helpful.”\\nI pointed out that focusing only on helpfulness can make a model overly compliant—so compliant, in fact, that it can be steered into sexual content within a few turns.\\nAfter I demonstrated that risk with a simple exchange, the prompt kept “polite.”\\nThese models are weird.“\\nHow OpenAI plans to improve its model testing processes going forward\\nThe company lists six process improvements for how to avoid similar undesirable and less-than-ideal model behavior in the future, but to me the most important is this:\\n“We’ll adjust our safety review process to formally consider behavior issues—such as hallucination, deception, reliability, and personality—as blocking concerns. Even if these issues aren’t perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.”\\nIn other words — despite how important data, especially quantitative data, is to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence — OpenAI recognizes that this alone can’t and should not be the only means by which a model’s performance is judged.\\nWhile many users providing a “thumbs up” could signal a type of desirable behavior in the short term, the long term implications for how the AI model responds and where those behaviors take it and its users, could ultimately lead to a very dark, distressing, destructive, and undesirable place. More is not always better — especially when you are constraining the “more” to a few domains of signals.\\nIt’s not enough to say that the model passed all of the tests or received a number of positive responses from users — the expertise of trained power users and their qualitative feedback that something “seemed off” about the model, even if they couldn’t fully express why, should carry much more weight than OpenAI was allocating previously.\\nLet’s hope the company — and the entire field — learns from this incident and integrates the lessons going forward.\\nBroader takeaways and considerations for enterprise decision-makers\\nSpeaking perhaps more theoretically, for myself, it also indicates why expertise is so important — and specifically, expertise in fields beyond and outside of the one you’re optimizing for (in this case, machine learning and AI). It’s the diversity of expertise that allows us as a species to achieve new advances that benefit our kind. One, say STEM, shouldn’t necessarily be held above the others in the humanities or arts.\\nAnd finally, I also think it reveals at its heart a fundamental problem with using human feedback to design products and services. Individual users may say they like a more sycophantic AI based on each isolated interaction, just like they also may say they love the way fast food and soda tastes, the convenience of single-use plastic containers, the entertainment and connection they derive from social media, the worldview validation and tribalist belonging they feel when reading politicized media or tabloid gossip. Yet again, taken all together, the cumulation of all of these types of trends and activities often leads to very undesirable outcomes for individuals and society — obesity and poor health in the case of fast food, pollution and endocrine disruption in the case of plastic waste, depression and isolation from overindulgence of social media, a more splintered and less-informed body public from reading poor quality news sources.\\nAI model designers and technical decision-makers at enterprises would do well to keep this broader idea in mind when designing metrics around any measurable goal — because even when you think you’re using data to your advantage, it could backfire in ways you didn’t fully expect or anticipate, leaving your scrambling to repair the damage and mop up the mess you made, however inadvertently.'}\n",

Human properties from Wikidata\\nB. Training parameters of entity recognizer\\nD. LLM probabilities: base models\\nE. Training size and performance\\n2.3 Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing\\nPPDP approaches to text sanitization rely on a privacy model specifying formal conditions that must be fulfilled to ensure the data can be shared without harm to the privacy of the registered individuals. The most prominent privacy model is k-anonymity (Samarati and Sweeney, 1998), which requires that an individual/entity be indistinguishable from k -1 other individuals/entities. This model was subsequently adapted to text data by approaches such as k- safety (Chakaravarthy et al., 2008) and k-confusability (Cumby and Ghani, 2011).\\nt-plausibility (Anandan et al., 2012) follows a similar approach, using already detected personal information and ensuring that those are sufficiently generalized to ensure that at least t documents can be mapped to the edited text. Sanchez and Batet (2016) present C-sanitized, which relies on an information-theoretic approach that computes the point-wise mutual information (using co-occurrence counts from web data) between the person or entity to protect and the terms of the document. Terms whose mutual information ends up above a given threshold are then masked.\\nk-anonymity was also employed in Papadopoulou et al. (2022) in combination with NLP-based approaches, where based on an assumption of an attacker’s knowledge, the optimal set of masking decisions was found to ensure k-anonymity.\\nFinally, Manzanares-Salor et al. (2022) provided an approach to the evaluation of disclosure risks that relies on training a text classifier to assess the difficulty of inferring the identity of the individual in question based on the sanitized text.\\n2.4 Differential Privacy\\nDifferential privacy (DP) is a framework for ensuring the privacy of individuals in datasets (Dwork et al., 2006). It essentially operates by producing randomized responses to queries. The level of artificial noise introduced in each response is optimized such as to provide a guarantee that the amount of information that can be learned about any individual remains under a given threshold.\\nFernandes et al. (2019) applied DP to text data, in combination with ML techniques by adding noise to the word embeddings of the model. Their work focused on removing stylistic cues from the text as a way to ensure that the author of the text could not be identified by it. Feyisetan et al. (2019) also apply noise to word embeddings in a setting where the geolocation data of an individual is to be protected.\\nMore recently, Sasada et al. (2021) tried to address the issue of the noise needed for DP causing utility loss in the resulting text by creating duplicates first, and then adding noise, thus reducing the amount of noise needed. Krishna et al. (2021) sought to address the same issue using an algorithm based on auto-encoders to transform text without losing data utility. Finally, Igamberdiev and Habernal (2023) introduced DPBART, a DP rewriting system based on pre-trained BART model, and which seeks to reduce the amount of artificial noise needed to reach a given privacy guarantee.\\nDP-oriented approaches generally lead to complete transformations of the text, at least for reasonable values of the privacy threshold. Those approaches are therefore well suited to the generation of synthetic texts, in particular to collect training data for machine learning models. However, they are difficult to apply to text sanitization, as most text sanitization problems are expected to retain the core content of the text and only edit out the personal identifiers. This is particularly the case for court judgments and medical records, as the sanitized documents should not alter the wording and semantic content conveyed in the text.\\nThis paper is available on arxiv under CC BY 4.0 DEED license.'}\n",

Learn More\\nWhile over 20 vendors announced agentic AI-based security agents, apps and platforms at RSAC 2025, the most insightful news from the conference is a rare, encouraging trend for security leaders. For the first time in three years, overall cybersecurity effectiveness has improved.\\nScale Venture Partners (SVP) recently released the 2025 Cybersecurity Perspectives Report, which shared that the average effectiveness of cybersecurity protections improved for the first time in three years, increasing to 61% efficacy this year from 48% in 2023. According to the report, “70% of security leaders were most protected against general phishing attacks, with only 28% of firms reporting compromise.”\\nSVP also found that 77% of CISOs believe protecting AI/ML models and data pipelines is a priority to improve their security posture by 2025, up from 55% last year. Notably, given the influx of new agentic AI solutions announced at RSAC, 75% of firms expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate SOC investigations using AI agents to triage large volumes of security alerts to prevent security incidents.\\nSVP’s rise in efficacy numbers isn’t accidental; they result from CISOs and their teams adopting automation at scale while successfully consolidating their platforms and reducing gaps attackers had walked through in the past.\\n“If you don’t have complete visibility, the attackers are going to go through the cracks between products,” Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks, told VentureBeat during RSAC 2025. “We designed our platform to eliminate those blind spots—bringing security and networking together so nothing escapes our eyes.”\\nAgentic AI is moving fast beyond minimum viable product to platform DNA\\nMaor’s perspective explains why a new definition of what a minimum viable product is needed for agentic AI in cybersecurity. RSAC 2025 revealed how mature agentic AI is becoming. There’s a group of vendors using agentic AI as a code-based adhesive to unify code bases and apps together, and then there are the ones who have been at this for years, and agentic AI is core to their code base and architecture.\\nCybersecurity providers in this latter group, where agentic AI is core to their platform and, in many cases, continue to double-down their R&D spend on excelling at agentic AI. This includes Cato Networks’ SASE Cloud Platform, Cisco AI Defense, CrowdStrike’s Falcon single agent architecture, Darktrace’s Cyber AI Loop, Elastic’s Elastic AI Assistant, Microsoft’s Security Copilot and Defender XDR Suite, Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XSIAM, SentinelOne’s Singularity Platform and Vectra AI’s Cognito Platform.\\nOrganizations that are relying on integrated AI-driven detection with automated containment are reducing dwell times by over 40%. They’re also nearly twice as likely to neutralize phishing-based intrusions before lateral movement occurs. Vendors on the show floor often relied on identity and access management scenarios to showcase how their agentic AI workflows could help trim workloads for security operations center (SOC) analysts.\\n“Identity is going to be a critical element of AI throughout its life cycle. AI agents are going to need identities. They’re going to need to understand zero trust, and how do we verify them? Explicitly manage least privileged access,” noted Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for Security, Vasu Jakkal, during her keynote. As Jakkal succinctly put it, “AI must first start with security. It’s critical that we evolve our security mechanisms as rapidly as we evolve AI.”\\nA common theme of every agentic AI demo across the show floor was triangulating attack data, quickly gaining insights into the form of tradecraft being used and then defining a containment strategy all in real time.\\nCrowdStrike showed how agentic AI can pivot from detection to real-time action through a live investigation of a North Korean threat campaign to place remote DevOps hires in strategic technology companies in the U.S. and around the world. The live demo followed the tradecraft of the DPRK’s Famous Chollima as it impersonated a remote DevOps hire, slipped past HR checks and leveraged legitimate tools, including RMM software and VS Code, to quietly exfiltrate data. It was a sharp reminder that, while powerful, agentic AI still relies on a human in the loop to spot adaptive threats and fine-tune models before the signal gets lost in the noise.\\nThe gen AI goal: discovering nation-state tradecraft and killing it\\nIt’s the attacks that no person, company, or nation sees coming that are the most devastating and challenging to contain and overcome. The thought of threats so devastating that they could easily shut down a power grid, payment, banking, or supply chain system dominates the minds of many of the brightest and most innovative technologies in cybersecurity.\\nCisco’s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel emphasized the urgency of strengthening cybersecurity with AI so that threats lurking that may be devastating once triggered can be found now and neutralized. “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale,” Patel said during his keynote.\\nPatel emphasized that AI-driven models are not deterministic: “They won’t give you the same answer every single time, introducing unprecedented risks.”\\nCISOs need to understand today’s complex risks and threats\\n“This isn’t another AI talk, I promise,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz joked as he opened his RSAC 2025 keynote. “I was asked to give one, and I said, ‘How about we talk about something that actually matters right now, like getting CISOs a seat at the board table?’” That punchline delivered two things at once: comic relief and a sharp pivot to the defining issue of cybersecurity leadership in 2025.\\nIn his keynote, “The CISO’s Guide to Securing a Board Seat,” Kurtz issued a clear call to action: “Cybersecurity is no longer a compliance suggestion. It’s a governance mandate. The SEC regulations have materially changed the arc of the CISO’s career.” Boards aren’t just evolving; they’re being forced to reckon with cyber risk as a primary business threat.\\nKurtz backed his argument with hard numbers: 72% of boards say they’re actively seeking cybersecurity expertise, but only 29% actually have it. “That’s not just a talent gap,” Kurtz said. “It’s an opportunity if you’re ready to step up,” he encouraged the audience.\\nHis roadmap for CISOs to reach the boardroom was tactical and hands-on:\\n- Level up your business fluency. “Understand where business value is created. If you can’t speak margin, ARR, or legal risk, you won’t last long at the table.”\\n- Speak the board’s language. “Every boardroom runs on three priorities: time, money, and legal risk. If you can’t translate cyber into those, you’ll stay on the sidelines.”\\n- Build your brand outside the security bubble. “Board members are on multiple boards. The way in is through trust and reputation, not just technical excellence.”\\nKurtz traced the path from regulatory reform to boardroom impact by revisiting how Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 transformed CFOs into solid boardroom contributors. He argued that the SEC’s 2024 breach reporting mandate does the same for CISOs. “Threats drive regulation, and regulation drives board composition,” he said. “This is our moment.”\\nHis advice wasn’t abstract. He urged CISOs to study proxy statements, identify committee-level needs and network strategically with board members who are “always looking to fill roles.” He pointed to CrowdStrike CISO Adam Zoller, now on the board of AdventHealth, as a model. Zoller, Kurtz says, is someone who earned his seat by staying in the room, learning how the board operated and being seen as more than a security expert.\\nKurtz closed with a challenge: “I hope to come back in ten years, still with red hair, and see CISOs on 50% of boards, just like CFOs. The boardroom’s not waiting for permission. The only question is: will it be you?”\\n“AI isn’t magic—It’s math”\\nDiana Kelley, CTO of Protect AI, drew one of the most significant early crowds at RSAC 2025 with a blunt message: “AI isn’t magic—it’s math. And just as we secure software, we must rigorously secure the AI lifecycle.” Her keynote provided a sound background that sliced through gen AI hype, spotlighting the real risks to AI models that every organization needs to defend against before beginning any work on their models. Kelly provided in-depth insights into model poisoning, prompt injections and hallucinations, calling for a full-stack approach to AI security.\\nShe introduced the OWASP Top 10 for gen AI, emphasizing the need to secure AI from day zero, partner with CISOs early, threat-model aggressively and treat prompts, outputs and agent chains as privileged attack surfaces.\\nPalo Alto Networks announced its intent to acquire Protect AI the same day as Kelley’s presentation, another factor driving so many conversations about her keynote.\\nRSAC 2025 shows why it’s time for agentic AI to deliver results\\nRSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work. For CISOs under pressure to justify spending and reduce risk, the focus is shifting from innovation hype to operational impact. The real wins, including 40% lower dwell time and phishing resilience reaching 70%, came from platform consolidation and automating alert triage, which are all proven technologies and techniques. Agentic AI’s moment of truth is here, especially for vendors just entering the market.'}\n",

The WHO reports that NCDs account for nearly 74% of all global deaths, underlining the urgent need for innovative strategies to address them.1 These diseases significantly strain healthcare budgets and resources, demanding a shift in healthcare approaches, particularly focusing on early detection and risk assessment.2–4\\nEarly detection of NCDs plays a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes and alleviating the substantial economic burden on healthcare systems.5 Timely identification allows for more effective treatment interventions, reduces complications and extends life expectancy.6–8 Additionally, early detection enables preventive measures and health education initiatives, ultimately lowering NCD incidence within communities and lightening the healthcare infrastructure’s load.9 10 Furthermore, early intervention leads to long-term cost savings, as managing advanced-stage NCDs becomes resource-intensive. However, late-stage diagnoses continue to pose significant challenges, often leading to limited treatment options, poorer prognoses and increased healthcare costs.11 12 This late-stage diagnosis results in diminished quality of life, emotional distress and higher disability rates. Addressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive strategy, and the present paper emphasises the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in overcoming barriers to early NCD detection, ultimately fostering improved patient outcomes and cost-effective healthcare delivery.\\nAI stands as a transformative force reshaping healthcare by analysing vast data sets, identifying patterns and generating actionable insights, making it a critical ally in early NCD detection and risk assessment.13 14 AI’s applications in healthcare range from medical imaging and predictive analytics to personalised medicine.15–17 AI-driven algorithms excel in interpreting radiological scans, predicting disease trajectories and tailoring treatments to individual profiles, showcasing their potential to revolutionise healthcare delivery.18 In the context of NCDs, AI holds the promise of earlier and more accurate diagnosis, improved risk stratification and timely intervention, advancing healthcare systems toward proactive disease management, reduced morbidity and enhanced patient outcomes.19 20\\nSeveral recent studies highlight AI’s role in various medical domains. For instance, blockchain-integrated AI solutions have been proposed for transparent and secure cancer classification, enhancing the reliability of diagnostic processes.21 Similarly, Machine Learning (ML)-based semantic segmentation techniques have been used to analyse microbial alterations, demonstrating their potential in microbiology and infectious disease research.22 Additionally, feature reduction techniques have been explored to enhance hepatocellular carcinoma prediction using machine learning algorithms.23 In the realm of post-treatment monitoring, ML approaches have been successfully employed to enhance abdominal fat prediction, particularly in cavitation post-treatment scenarios.24 Furthermore, deep learning frameworks have been optimised to improve epileptic seizure recognition, leveraging feature scaling and dropout layers to enhance model performance.25 Beyond disease classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to skin lesion classification, providing accurate detection models for infectious diseases such as monkeypox.26 Furthermore, machine learning has been employed in analysing core muscle function in female sexual dysfunction.27 AI has also been instrumental in optimising disease classification by analysing symptom patterns through language models.28\\nRecognising a significant research gap in the field, the present comprehensive bibliometric study aims to synthesise the evolving landscape of AI solutions for NCDs. By systematically assessing existing research, the bibliometric study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of AI’s current state in early NCD detection and risk assessment while identifying emerging trends. Furthermore, it evaluates the progression of AI techniques over time and their real-world applicability in NCD management. These bibliometric findings aim to inform decision-making, foster interdisciplinary collaboration and enhance patient care and resource allocation in the context of NCDs, offering insights that can shape the future of NCD management through AI’s transformative potential.\\nMethods\\nStudy design\\nDue to the importance and the general nature of the research question addressed, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was considered suitable for the present study. The present comprehensive bibliometric analysis is not a form of systematic or scoping review. In designing our bibliometric analysis, we intentionally made methodological choices to ensure timely completion without compromising the quality and validity of our findings. These decisions included narrowing our search to a single comprehensive database, a departure from the usual practice of using multiple databases as in systematic and scoping reviews. Additionally, we assigned specific quality checks to one author rather than following the traditional dual-reviewer process, focusing on efficiency and speed. To further accelerate the review, we opted for narrative synthesis instead of quantitative synthesis, allowing us to provide a concise yet informative summary of the available evidence. We recognise the importance of research transparency, and therefore, we are dedicated to sharing the detailed search strategy used to retrieve the data to promote reproducibility and transparency.\\nDatabase used\\nTo carry out the study, pertinent literature was retrieved from the Scopus database. The rationale and benefits underpinning the exclusive use of Scopus (www.scopus.com) were multifaceted and included comprehensiveness, interdisciplinary coverage, convenience and time-saving.\\nKeywords\\nIn the context of this study, the complete set of keywords related to AI were: “artificial intelligence”, “machine learning”, “deep learning”, “neural networks”, “cognitive computing”, “natural language processing”, “expert systems”, “computer vision”, “autonomous systems”, “robotic intelligence”, “computational intelligence”, “AI algorithms”, “intelligent systems”, “AI technologies”, “automated intelligence”, “smart systems”, “self-learning systems”, “AI applications”, “cognitive machines”, “machine intelligence”, “data-driven intelligence”, “algorithmic intelligence”, “automated decision-making”, “intelligent automation”, “AI models” or “AI frameworks”, “cognitive algorithms”, “learning algorithms”, “AI-driven systems”, “intelligent agents”, “AI-driven analytics”. Terms related to early detection and risk assessment used in the current study were: “early diagnosis”, (early AND detection), (early AND diagnosis), “pre-symptomatic diagnosis”, “early detection”, “risk of”, “risk assessment”, “risk analysis”, “risk evaluation”, “risk appraisal”, “risk estimation”, “risk profiling”, “risk determination”, “risk measurement”, “risk prediction”, “risk categorization”, “risk scoring”, “risk stratification”, “risk grading”, “risk diagnosis”, “risk identification”, “risk characterization”, “risk classification”, “risk judgment”, “risk estimation”. Terms related to NCD included a set of more than 100 NCDs including different types of cancers, diabetes mellitus and other endocrine disorders, different cardiovascular diseases and different neurological and psychiatric diseases. The list also included disease conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (online supplemental table S1).\\nSupplemental material\\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\\nIn our systematic search strategy, we established specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to guide the selection of relevant studies. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies published between 2000 and 2024, written in English, and categorised as primary research articles published in journals. We focused our interest on investigations that explored the use of telemedicine/telehealth among diverse underserved groups and in various underserved areas. Excluded from our consideration were articles of a review nature, such as narrative reviews or literature reviews, as well as studies conducted in languages other than English. Additionally, studies conducted in 2025 and those primarily focused on interview methodologies, protocols, perceptions or individual cases were also excluded.\\nValidation of data\\nTo ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data we extracted, we implemented a meticulous validation process. Initially, we conducted a title-abstract-based search to confirm the absence of false-positive results, enlisting the assistance of two colleagues in the pharmacy and medicine fields who volunteered to assist in this validation process. Subsequently, to guarantee the comprehensiveness of our data set, we subjected the collected articles to a rigorous cross-validation process against a selection of highly cited articles obtained from Google Scholar. The presence of all articles in the retrieved metadata affirmed the inclusiveness of our search strategy. Additionally, the concurrent alignment of active journals and prolific authors with the field further reinforced the credibility of our search approach.\\nAnalytical mapping and research topics\\nWe performed a comprehensive analysis and cartographic representation of the research landscape using Microsoft Excel V.365 and VOSviewer.29 VOSviewer is a widely recognised software tool known for its proficiency in mapping research domains. We seamlessly integrated relevant data sourced from the Scopus database, including publication metadata, into VOSviewer to analyse frequent author keywords and terminologies. The resulting visualisations allowed us to gain valuable insights into the intricate network of research topics and relationships within the field. Interpreting VOSviewer maps is akin to deciphering a colourful and interconnected web of knowledge. Each term or keyword in the data set is visualised as a point on the map, represented by a circle or node. These nodes come in various sizes and colours, and they are connected by lines of different thicknesses. The node size is an indicator of a term’s importance or prevalence in the data set. Larger nodes signify that a particular term is frequently discussed or plays a significant role in the body of research. On the flip side, smaller nodes represent less commonly mentioned concepts. The colours of these nodes serve a dual purpose. First, they help categorise terms into thematic groups. Terms of the same colour usually belong to the same cluster or share a common theme. Second, they assist in identifying different research clusters or topic groups within the data set. For instance, if there is a cluster of blue nodes, it might indicate that these terms are all related to a specific area of research. The distance between nodes is a measure of their closeness in meaning or concept. Nodes positioned closer together share a stronger semantic or contextual connection. They are likely to be mentioned together in research articles or share a similar theme. Conversely, nodes placed farther apart have less in common in terms of their usage in literature. The lines connecting nodes represent the relationships between terms. The thickness of these lines tells us how strong or frequent these connections are. Thick lines indicate that the terms they link are often discussed together or share a robust thematic association. Thinner lines imply weaker or less frequent connections. In essence, VOSviewer maps provide a visual narrative of the underlying structure and relationships within your data set. By examining node size and colour, you can pinpoint important terms and thematic clusters. Meanwhile, the distance between nodes and line thickness unveils the semantic closeness and strength of associations between terms. These visual insights are invaluable for researchers seeking to uncover key concepts, discover research clusters and identify trends within their field of study.\\nResults\\nBibliometric analysis of publication output (main information)\\nFigure 1 and table 1 show the flow chart and the main bibliometric information regarding AI-enhanced early detection and risk assessment of NCD literature included in the analysis. The retrieved publications have accumulated 37 194 citations thus far.\\nIn the course of our systematic search, we retrieved a total of 1745 articles relevant to our research inquiry. Over the years, there were few or no publications. It was in the most recent years that we noted a substantial surge in research activity, indicating a thriving and dynamic research landscape in the area of investigation (figure 2). Several core journals had a pivotal role in the realm of AI-enhanced early detection and risk assessment of NCD. ‘Scientific Reports’ led the pack with 65 articles, accounting for 3.7% of the publications in the field. Right on its heels is ‘IEEE Access’ contributing significantly with 49 articles, making up 2.8% of the literature. The ‘Computers in Biology and Medicine’ takes a noteworthy position, featuring 31 articles (1.8%), while the ‘Plos One’ journal follows closely with 30 articles (1.7%). In the analysis of core institutions contributing to research in the field, the Harvard Medical School leads the way with a substantial 37 (2.1%) articles. Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China follows with 28 (1.6%) articles, followed by Brigham and Women’s Hospital (n=27; 1.5%).\\nThe number of citations received by articles in this field has grown significantly over the years, starting from 14 in 2003 and reaching 6950 in 2021 (figure 2). This indicates a substantial increase in the recognition and impact of the subject over time. The number of citations accelerated as the years progressed. For example, the number of citations more than tripled from 2010 (354) to 2016 (1142), and then it increased dramatically in subsequent years. This non-linear growth suggests that the work gained increasing attention and influence as time went on. The steep increase in the number of citations, especially in the later years, resembles an exponential growth pattern. The increase from 7214 citations in 2020 to 6950 citations in 2021 is a strong indicator of exponential growth. Exponential growth is an indication of widespread recognition of the topic investigated.\\nOnline supplemental table S2 presents the main bibliometric indicators of publications on the the research field by the year of publication.\\nInternational research collaboration\\nIn the analysis of core countries contributing to research in the field (table 2 and figure 3), China leads the way with a substantial 445 (25.5%) articles. The USA follows with 410 (23.5%) articles, followed by India (n=265; 15.2%), the UK (n=159; 9.1%) and Saudi Arabia (n=107; 6.1%).\\nThe network visualisation map of countries, which considers countries with a minimum contribution of 10 articles, offers a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of global research collaboration within a specific field (figure 3). Within this map, 45 countries are represented, and several noteworthy observations emerge. First and foremost, the USA assumes a pivotal role in the map’s landscape. Not only does it boast the highest number of connections, but it also occupies a central position, signifying its substantial research contributions in the field. The prominence of the USA underscores its role as a hub for international research collaboration. One of the most significant findings is the robust research partnership between the USA and India, evident from the thickness of the connection between these two countries. This suggests a high level of engagement and knowledge exchange between researchers based in the USA and their counterparts in India, emphasising the global nature of scientific inquiry. Moreover, the UK and China also emerge as key collaborators, following closely behind India in terms of their connections with the USA. This emphasises the importance of international cooperation, with these countries actively engaging in collaborative research efforts within this specific field. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia stands out on the map with a relatively large node size. This suggests that Saudi Arabia has made substantial contributions to research within the field and likely has its network of collaborations with various countries. Notably, the map highlights a particularly strong research partnership between Saudi Arabia and India. This collaboration underscores the active exchange of knowledge sharing and expertise between researchers and institutions in these two countries, further enriching the global research landscape in this domain.\\nMost impactful articles on early detection/diagnosis\\nThe top-cited articles on early disease detection using AI encompass a range of crucial healthcare applications. Recurrent neural networks have been shown to be effective in predicting initial heart failure diagnosis by analysing temporal relations in electronic health records.30 Another notable theme focuses on the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).31–33 Other studies tackle early-stage lung cancer diagnosis by leveraging spectroscopic analysis of circulating exosomes, showcasing the potential of combining deep learning with medical imaging for liquid biopsy.34 MRI biomarkers have also been identified for early AD diagnosis,35 with machine learning distinguishing between AD and mild cognitive impairment stages. These articles collectively demonstrate how AI-driven approaches are revolutionising early disease detection. Another significant theme revolves around the early identification of diabetic retinopathy,36 37 a leading cause of vision loss. Researchers have leveraged deep CNNs, achieving remarkable accuracy of 94.5% in classifying retinal images. These studies employ deep learning alongside brain network and clinical data, resulting in improved accuracy compared with traditional classifiers. Multimodal approaches also gain attention, combining imaging, genetic and clinical data to classify patients with AD. Oral cancer detection uses deep learning algorithms applied to hyperspectral patient images, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.38 Another notable study focuses on gastric cancer detection, introducing a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for early diagnosis.39 This DCNN was designed by a system to detect early gastric cancer without blind spots during esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\\nMost impactful articles on risk assessment\\nIn recent years, AI has been applied to predict the risks associated with NCDs. Several notable studies have emerged, all aimed at improving risk assessment and prediction for conditions related to NCDs. One common theme across these studies is the utilisation of machine learning algorithms to outperform traditional risk prediction methods. These algorithms analyse extensive data sets, including electronic medical records, mammograms and patient information, to develop accurate risk models. For instance, in heart failure cases, deep learning techniques demonstrated superior performance in predicting 30-day readmissions, enabling healthcare teams to focus interventions on high-risk patients.40 41 Cardiovascular risk assessment also benefited greatly from machine learning, as it enhanced prediction accuracy by considering complex interactions between risk factors.42 43 Moreover, machine learning’s potential extended to breast cancer risk prediction, where deep learning models showed substantial improvements over traditional risk assessments.44 45 The application of unsupervised deep learning in breast density segmentation and mammographic risk scoring demonstrated its potential to automate processes and predict breast cancer risk with remarkable accuracy.46 Diabetes risk stratification was another area of focus, and researchers optimised machine learning systems to handle missing values and outliers, achieving higher accuracy in risk prediction.47 Furthermore, a deep neural network can predict new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) from the 12-lead ECG in patients with no previous history of AF. This prediction may help identify patients at risk for AF-related strokes.48 Furthermore, inflammatory bowel disease risk assessment reached new heights as machine learning harnessed vast data sets and modern techniques to build optimal predictive models.49 These models outperformed previous risk prediction methods, offering promising advancements in patient care. In the context of coronary artery disease, machine learning integrated information from coronary CT angiography-derived plaque data, offering enhanced risk stratification compared with conventional methods.50 In essence, these studies collectively underscore the transformative power of machine learning and AI in revolutionising the prediction of NCDs.\\nEmerging research topics\\nThe 10 most recently published articles in the data set included several studies that harnessed the power of AI to advance early detection and risk prediction in the context of NCDs. Among these studies, one focused on patients with AD, using deep learning approaches and CNNs for early diagnosis of AD on MRI images.51–53 Another study introduced a recently developed deep-learning network to assess oral cancer diagnosis.54\\nAdditionally, a study delved into the early diagnosis and classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using diverse machine learning methods.55 These methods were employed to identify crucial ASD traits, with the goal of enhancing and automating the diagnostic process.\\nIn the realm of breath analysis, a study sought to achieve early detection of lung cancer.56 It used a gas sensor array and deep learning algorithm. Furthermore, a study centred on chronic kidney disease developed novel machine-learning strategies-based prediction models.57 The models were developed using a supervised machine-learning algorithm (random forest, support vector machine and decision tree) and feature selection techniques (recursive feature elimination with cross validation and univariate feature selection). This work was crucial for understanding the disease’s progression and recommending appropriate treatments for individuals. Moreover, researchers developed and validated a prediction model based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data to identify a week-to-week risk profile of excessive hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes. They found that the prediction models based on real-world CGM data can be used to predict the risk of hypoglycaemia in the forthcoming week. The models showed good performance in both the internal and external validation cohorts.58 In the realm of cancer and diagnosis, a study introduced machine learning models, including classical approaches and neural networks, to predict the likelihood of recurrence in patients diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The outcomes demonstrated the models’ efficiency in stratifying recurrence risk among these patients.59 Lastly, researchers explored the risk prediction model of heart diseases based on dual-stage stacked machine learning approaches.60 The results reveal that using this two-step stacking machine learning approach has the potential to provide accurate and timely diagnosis, supporting the global effort to reduce heart disease-related deaths.\\nMost frequent author keywords (research hotspots)\\nBy generating a network visualisation map of author keywords, focusing on those appearing at least 16 times, we constructed a map comprising 50 distinct items (figure 4).

The study aims to emphasise the significance of AI-driven approaches in healthcare transformation, particularly in facilitating early disease detection and risk evaluation. In pursuit of this objective, the study systematically synthesises research trends, identifies key areas of interest, reviews influential articles and explores emerging topics within the realm of AI applications in NCD management. AI-driven early detection holds promise in promoting health equity by ensuring equitable access to timely diagnosis and healthcare services for underserved and marginalised populations.61 This aligns seamlessly with broader societal objectives centred around fairness in healthcare provision.62 The study’s findings carry implications for health policies aimed at supporting AI-driven healthcare initiatives and guiding the judicious allocation of resources. Healthcare organisations can leverage the insights gleaned from this research to strategically allocate resources for the implementation of AI, directing investments towards AI technologies, professional training and data infrastructure based on identified research trends.\\nTo advance the implementation of AI in the management of NCD, future research should explore various avenues. First, rigorous validation of the AI-driven models and methods in real clinical settings is imperative. This validation process, involving close collaborations between AI experts and healthcare practitioners, ensures the reliability and practical applicability of these innovative technologies within the complexities of healthcare delivery. Moreover, fostering interdisciplinary research becomes pivotal. Collaboration among experts spanning diverse fields such as computer science, medicine, epidemiology and ethics is indispensable. This multidisciplinary approach can yield holistic solutions that encompass not only the technical aspects but also ethical and social considerations. The ethical dimensions of AI in healthcare merit profound exploration, especially concerning issues like patient privacy, data security and the potential biases inherent in algorithms.63 The ethical concerns surrounding AI in healthcare primarily stem from algorithmic bias, which can lead to disparities in patient outcomes due to non-diverse training data sets. Data security and patient privacy are also critical, as AI systems rely on vast repositories vulnerable to breaches. Additionally, the increasing autonomy of AI in clinical decision-making raises accountability issues, especially in cases of misdiagnosis, while the opacity of machine learning models—the ‘black box’ problem—poses challenges for transparency and interpretability. Beyond these ethical and privacy concerns, AI’s growing role in diagnostics and healthcare management impacts the doctor–patient relationship and the broader healthcare system, necessitating regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with ethical responsibility. Multidisciplinary collaboration among physicians, data scientists, legal experts, ethicists and policymakers is essential to ensure AI enhances healthcare equity, accessibility and patient-centred care rather than exacerbating disparities or depersonalising medicine. A structured, pragmatic approach is needed to align AI integration with ethical principles, respect patient autonomy and improve medical service quality and efficiency.63\\nSubsequent research endeavours ought to concentrate on enhancing the accessibility and affordability of AI-driven early detection tools. This becomes particularly crucial in resource-limited settings, where addressing health disparities can significantly impact public health outcomes. For emerging scholars and researchers entering this field, several key implications arise. First, the study underscores the paramount importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Young scholars should actively seek opportunities to engage across diverse disciplines to harness the full potential of AI in healthcare. Second, an emphasis on data ethics is essential. Young scholars should immerse themselves in discussions and research related to ethical considerations, particularly in the context of data privacy and security within AI-driven healthcare solutions. Lastly, young scholars can make substantial contributions by focusing their research on global health issues. Given the global impact of NCDs, addressing health disparities and ensuring the accessibility of AI-driven solutions worldwide becomes a compelling avenue for impactful research endeavours.\\nThe present study showed much emphasis on AI-enhanced early detection and risk assessment of AD. AD represents one of the most prevalent and debilitating neurodegenerative conditions worldwide, affecting millions of individuals and their families.64–67 The urgency surrounding Alzheimer’s research is underscored by the profound societal and economic burden it imposes. AD is a global health crisis, with its prevalence steadily rising due to ageing populations. The impact of Alzheimer’s on individuals, families and healthcare systems is profound, necessitating an intense focus on early detection to mitigate its effects. As of now, there is no cure for AD.64–67 However, early diagnosis can provide an opportunity for interventions and treatments that may slow its progression and improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Delaying its onset or slowing its progression can have a substantial positive impact. Advances in medical imaging, biomarker identification and AI have opened new avenues for early AD detection. These technological advancements have heightened interest in research aimed at identifying reliable and accessible methods for early diagnosis. Early diagnosis of AD aligns with broader public health strategies aimed at preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases.\\nIn comparison to other bibliometric analyses exploring the application of AI in medical fields, our study offers a focused examination of AI’s role in NCDs. For instance, Xiong et al conducted a bibliometric analysis on AI in liver cancer, revealing a rapid increase in publications since 2017, with China leading in output but the USA exhibiting higher citation impact.68 Similarly, Rahman et al mapped AI research in medical diagnosis in India, highlighting significant international collaborations and identifying prevalent themes such as machine learning and COVID-19.69 These studies, along with others focusing on specific diseases or regional research trends,70–72 provide valuable insight into the evolving landscape of AI in healthcare. Our analysis contributes to this body of knowledge by specifically addressing the application of AI across various NCDs, thereby offering a comprehensive overview that underscores both the advancements and the existing gaps in this critical area of healthcare research.\\nTraining healthcare professionals in AI-driven early diagnosis and risk assessment for NCDs is pivotal in modern healthcare. This entails comprehensive education for doctors, nurses and technicians, covering both AI theory and practical usage. Continuing medical education should incorporate AI to keep them updated. Trust in AI is vital since some may be initially hesitant.73–77 Trust-building involves rigorous testing, validation and clinical trials to demonstrate AI’s accuracy. AI should seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, supporting healthcare providers rather than replacing them, freeing them from data analysis. It enhances evidence-based medicine by uncovering patterns in vast data sets, complementing clinical judgement. Ethical discussions are necessary, addressing privacy, data security and bias.78–83 Compliance with healthcare AI regulations is crucial. Effective patient communication about AI’s role is vital. In conclusion, integrating AI into healthcare requires education, trust, ethics and compliance, ensuring its role as a valuable tool for patient care while upholding ethical standards.84 85\\nRegarding the study’s limitations, several factors deserve consideration. First, the reliance solely on the Scopus database presents a limitation. This singular source, although extensive, may not encompass the entirety of relevant articles in the field, potentially introducing bias into the selection of materials. Additionally, language and publication bias could have influenced the study’s findings. The inclusion criteria restricting articles to the English language might have inadvertently excluded valuable research published in other languages, potentially introducing language-related biases. Moreover, focusing primarily on primary research articles might have omitted valuable insights from comprehensive review articles. Temporal bias emerges as a concern as well. The choice of narrative synthesis over quantitative synthesis represents another limitation. While narrative synthesis provides a qualitative overview, it may restrict the study’s ability to draw statistically significant conclusions, potentially limiting the depth of analysis. A key limitation of bibliometric analysis is its inability to perform in-depth content evaluation, as conducted in systematic reviews. Unlike systematic reviews, which critically assess study methodologies, findings and biases, bibliometric studies primarily focus on quantitative metrics such as publication trends, citation patterns and research productivity. Consequently, this study does not examine the disadvantages, barriers or potential negative implications of AI in NCDs, nor does it explore ethical concerns or privacy protection issues. Furthermore, the absence of content analysis limits the ability to investigate conceptual frameworks, methodological rigour or research gaps in depth. Despite these constraints, bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the evolution and impact of research in the field.\\nConclusions\\nIn this comprehensive analysis of the role of AI in early identification and risk evaluation of NCDs, we have delved into various facets of this evolving field. The study sought to provide a thorough overview of AI’s current state in NCD detection and risk assessment, identify emerging trends and evaluate the progression of AI techniques over time.\\nThe findings of this bibliometric study have several important implications for the future of healthcare and NCD management. First, AI-driven solutions for early disease detection and risk assessment represent transformative potential in healthcare. The increasing number of citations in recent years indicates growing recognition and impact, suggesting that AI is poised to revolutionise the field. Notably, the study identified key research hotspots, such as machine learning, deep learning and specific NCDs like AD and diabetes. These hotspots are driving innovation in AI applications for healthcare, offering valuable insights into the most promising areas for future research and development. The most impactful articles highlighted in this bibliometric study demonstrate the practical applications of AI in early disease detection and risk assessment. These studies span various NCDs, from AD to cancer and showcase how AI can outperform traditional methods, providing more accurate predictions and diagnoses.\\nInternational research collaboration emerged as a significant aspect of this field, with the USA taking a central role and collaborating closely with countries like India, the UK and China. This global collaboration enriches the research landscape and fosters knowledge exchange. Moving forward, it is crucial to validate AI-driven models in real clinical settings and address ethical considerations, patient privacy and data security. Interdisciplinary collaboration between AI experts and healthcare practitioners will be pivotal in ensuring the practical applicability of these technologies.\\nAdditionally, the education and training of healthcare professionals in AI-driven healthcare are paramount, and building trust in AI systems is vital for their successful integration into clinical workflows.\\nWhile this study provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in NCD early detection and risk assessment, several promising directions emerge for future research: future studies should investigate the synergistic potential of combining imaging data (MRI, CT) with omics data (genomics, proteomics) and electronic health records through advanced multimodal AI architectures. There is a critical need for large-scale prospective trials to validate AI models in diverse clinical settings, particularly in low-resource environments where early NCD detection could have a maximal impact. Parallel research is needed to establish robust ethical guidelines addressing data privacy, algorithmic bias and equitable access to AI-powered diagnostic tools. The establishment of standardised benchmarking data sets and shared computational infrastructure could accelerate innovation while facilitating direct comparison between different AI approaches.\\nData availability statement\\nData are available in a public, open access repository.

He was not there as the CEO of OpenAI, but as the co-founder and chairman of Tools for Humanity, the parent company of a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin that’s now available in the US. Worldcoin is distributed to people who scan their eyes at one of the startup’s orbs, which are rolling out in retail stores across America. At the same time, the token is being used to build a super app to rival X.\\nTools for Humanity’s World app is a crypto wallet, social network, and mini-app platform all in one. Its monthly user base has doubled in the last six months to 26 million people, 12 million of whom have been verified by an orb. In the World app, you can message others via a chat interface tied to World IDs — the blockchain-based identifier you get after scanning your eyes — and send or receive cryptocurrency. There are also dozens of mini apps available from developers like Kalshi, many of which let you transact in-app with Worldcoin.\\nCreating a hub for finance and social networking is Musk’s stated intention for X, which is gearing up to launch Venmo-like money features later this year in partnership with Visa. This week, Tools for Humanity also announced a partnership with Visa to release a US debit card later this summer. It will let you transact with Worldcoin and offer rewards for AI subscriptions.\\nBy verifying that people are human, Tools for Humanity is also trying to address the bot problem that Musk said he wanted to fix when he bought Twitter. Onstage at the event, Altman recalled a walk co-founder Alex Blania and he took through San Francisco five years ago, well before the launch of ChatGPT.\\n“It was clear to us that there was a need for something like this, that we needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of AGI,” he said. “We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.”\\nDuring a press Q&A after the keynote, Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania called out X as the kind of platform he’s trying to improve with World ID verification, which the startup plans to eventually charge developers for. Bots on X used to be “so stupid that you could see it was some crypto scam,” he said, acknowledging that now, it’s “not as clear.”\\nThere were several OpenAI leaders in the audience at this week’s event. A rumor leading up to it was that the two companies would announce a partnership for OpenAI’s planned social network. Given the Altman connection, I asked Blania during the press Q&A if he wanted to work with OpenAI. He responded that he was “definitely open to it” and hinted that there would be more to come on that front. I had hoped to ask Altman about it as well, but he slipped out after the keynote.\\nMeta’s AI app strategy\\nEarlier this week, I attended Meta’s first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, at its headquarters in Menlo Park. That same morning, the standalone Meta AI app was released with a social feed for sharing interactions with the assistant. Eventually, the app is going to add a premium tier and ads.\\nAfter his opening keynote at LlamaCon, I caught up with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, to ask why Meta AI is getting its own app, why it has a social component, and what else he thinks sets the app apart.\\nThe following conversation has been edited for length and clarity:\\nWhat’s the goal of doing a standalone Meta AI app?\\nAlmost a billion people are using Meta AI. There’s a bunch of lighter-weight usage, but then there are some communities of people that are going super deep on it. We wanted to offer the lightweight mode in our apps and also the heavyweight mode.\\nDoes this mean that Meta AI’s hooks in the other apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) will disappear or become optional?\\nOur plan is to keep it the way it is. Some of these things make sense in the apps. A lot of people are using it in search to learn more about a specific meme or a specific piece of content. We’ll continue to have those sorts of integrations.\\nWhen you compare Meta AI to other assistants like ChatGPT, what do you think is its edge?\\nThere’s voice, there’s personalization, the social features, and then there’s the integration with hardware. We’ve done a lot of work on getting the voice to really low latency and making it really expressive, which lets you have an ongoing conversation.\\nThe second piece is the personalization. It remembers everything I’ve told it. It also incorporates your Facebook and Instagram data, if you connect your accounts, to understand interests in a niche way. It knows I’m a marathoner. It knows I’m very interested in AI. It knows the humor I like. That starts to get you a pretty fascinating level of depth when it comes to answering basic questions. We’ve created the best personalized experiences in social media, and we know that’s the difference between a vanilla app and something that people really love. So that’s going to be a big differentiator, I expect, for us.\\nThe social stuff is incredibly fun. Many people post the equivalent of political cartoons with visual commentary on today’s events. An observation we had is that people don’t know what to do with AI, and it’s not until they’ve been walked through it by somebody who’s an expert that the light bulb goes off. Just like social media, a lot of this is memetic. You’re inspired by what you see other people do.\\nWill the Meta AI Discover feed become more of its own social network and not just a way to find prompts?\\nI think we’ll add more to it. I’ve already found a bunch of AI creators using it. With early communities, you want a dedicated place because it’s less pressurized. I’m not going to share my AI-generated artwork on Instagram unless it’s really good. If you have a place that’s just for this thing, there’s going to be a community around it.\\nIs there hope that this app also helps drive Meta Ray-Ban sales, since it’s how you pair with them?\\nI think it could in the following way: you see people using Ray-Bans in the app. For a lot of people, that’s going to be the way they get excited about it instead of seeing marketing.\\nWhat did you all learn from the Llama 4 benchmark fiasco?\\nI think the most important thing for benchmarks is to stay focused on what actually matters for your product. Part of what we need to do is just be really, really, really clear on that. I think every organization is going through some version of this. The eval that matters is whether the product is good, period.\\nLink list\\nMore to click on:\\n- “Cook chose poorly:” How Apple blew up its control over the App Store.\\n- OpenAI’s post-mortem on what went wrong with its “sycophantic” change to ChatGPT.\\n- Duolingo’s internal memo on going “AI-first.”\\n- Granola released its iOS app.\\n- An oral history on how the transformer upended the AI industry.\\n- The AI model “leaderboard illusion.”\\n- Mark Zuckerberg’s interview with Ben Thompson.\\n- Tim Sweeney’s interview with Lex Fridman.\\n- Ashlee Vance meets with someone who got a Neuralink implant.\\nIf you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line and all of our reporting.\\nAs always, I welcome your feedback, especially if you have thoughts on this issue or a story idea to share.

This differs from traditional self-driving car data-sharing models, which are immediate and allow no storage or caching.\\nThe scientists charted how quickly the cars learned and whether Cached-DFL outperformed the centralized data systems common in today’s self-driving cars. They discovered that as long as cars were within 100 meters (328 feet) of each other, they could view and share each other\\'s information. The vehicles did not need to know each other to share information.\\n\"Scalability is one of the key advantages of decentralized FL,\" Dr. Jie Xu, associate professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Florida told Live Science. \"Instead of every car communicating with a central server or all other cars, each vehicle only exchanges model updates with those it encounters. This localized sharing approach prevents the communication overhead from growing exponentially as more cars participate in the network.\"\\nThe researchers envision Cached-DFL making self-driving technology more affordable by lowering the need for computing power, since the processing load is distributed across many vehicles instead of concentrated in one server.\\nNext steps for the researchers include real-world testing of Cached-DFL, removing computer system framework barriers between different brands of self-driving vehicles and enabling communication between vehicles and other connected devices like traffic lights, satellites, and road signals. This is known as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) standards.\\nThe team also aims to drive a broader move away from centralized servers and instead towards smart devices that gather and process data closest to where the data is collected, which makes data sharing as fast as possible. This creates a form of rapid swarm intelligence not solely for vehicles but for satellites, drones, robots and other emerging forms of connected devices.\\n\"Decentralized federated learning offers a vital approach to collaborative learning without compromising user privacy,\" Javed Khan, president of software and advanced safety and user experience at Aptiv told Live Science. \"By caching models locally, we reduce reliance on central servers and enhance real-time decision-making, crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.\"\\nLisa D Sparks is a freelance journalist for Live Science and an experienced editor and marketing professional with a background in journalism, content marketing, strategic development, project management, and process automation.

The company has more than $10 million in signed contracts (often denoted using the term annual recurring revenue), according to two sources. Another source familiar with the talks said the round hasn’t been closed yet and the figures could change.\\nDecagon, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel did not immediately respond to comment requests.\\nDecagon is building customer support chatbots and agents— software that can autonomously perform basic tasks— for things like answering questions on how a product works, processing refunds and canceling subscriptions. Companies like Notion, Bilt, Duolingo, Substack and Rippling use Decagon customer support chatbots.\\nThe latest investment comes less than a year after Decagon raised a $65 million Series B round led by Bain Capital Ventures at a $650 million valuation, Forbesreported in October. The new investment would bring Decagon’s total funding to $200 million. The company, which was featured on the Forbes AI 50 list, was cofounded by 27-year-old CEO Jesse Zhang and Ashwin Sreenivas in 2023 after the duo surveyed dozens of companies to find the problem that could best be solved with AI.\\nCustomer support, a tedious but pivotal part of any business, has long been targeted for automation as a means to save millions in labor costs by eliminating largely outsourced customer support teams. Credit card provider Bilt downsized its customer support team from hundreds to 65 with Decagon, Forbes reported last year. And fitness giant ClassPass, which uses Decagon’s AI agents to carry out 2.5 million conversations with its customers, has reduced its customer support costs by 95%, according to The Information. “We think AI agents can be 10x employees,” Zhang told Forbes in March.\\nUnder the hood, Decagon’s agents are built on the most advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere, and trained on internal data like how-to blogs, manuals and past customer service conversations. Staff rate and review responses generated by the AI to improve it. In February, Decagon partnered with audio generation startup ElevenLabs to create voice agents to have more natural, human-like conversations with customers.\\nCustomer service software is a competitive market and Decagon is up against companies like $4.5 billion-valued Sierra, helmed by former Salesforce co-CEO and OpenAI board Chairman Bret Taylor, and Salesforce, which has its own AI agents for customer support. The products themselves are also increasingly identical to each other and businesses regularly do what are called bake offs to pit one AI tool against another to see how well they perform on the job.\\n“Decagon claims they win almost every time they go up against Sierra head to head,” said one investor involved in the talks. “Ultimately, they are both going to have exactly the same product and it will really be a race to see who can solve a higher percentage of the support calls with the best accuracy.”\\nRashi Shrivastava is a reporter covering technology with a focus in artificial intelligence.

Create a free account to share your thoughts.\\nThe landscape of nursing education is changing rapidly, and as leaders in nursing education who have experienced firsthand the evolution of this field, we can confidently say that technology is at the heart of this transformation. The healthcare sector has embraced digital tools, and nursing education has followed suit, integrating telehealth, virtual simulations, and online platforms. This shift is not just about convenience— it is about preparing nursing students with the skills and experiences they need to thrive in a healthcare environment increasingly driven by technology.\\nAs institutions like American Sentinel College of Nursing & Health Sciences at Post University continue to innovate, they are leveraging technology to offer more flexible, accessible, and scalable nursing programs. In our experience, the integration of technology into nursing curricula has opened new doors for students, enabling them to balance work, family, and education while still receiving a rigorous education.\\nTechnology also enhances the inclusivity of nursing education by removing geographical and scheduling barriers. Today’s students are often adult learners, career changers, or working nurses seeking advanced credentials—technology makes their pursuit of education possible. From asynchronous coursework to mobile-accessible learning materials, online nursing education is making it possible to meet students where they are.\\nIn this article, we will explore how technology is shaping nursing education, the challenges it presents, and the implications for future nurses.\\nThe Evolution of Online Nursing Education\\nKey Components of Effective Online Nursing Programs\\nThe shift to online education has been revolutionary, especially in nursing programs. As we have witnessed the growth of online education at Post University, we can tell you that the key to an effective online nursing program is striking a balance between theory and practical application. Successful programs emphasize interactive, self-paced learning, with flexibility to accommodate working professionals while ensuring robust academic content.\\nAt Post University, for example, we have designed our online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing RN to BSN program to incorporate technology that mirrors real-world practice. Through interactive assignments, virtual labs, and asynchronous discussions, students engage deeply with course materials. This approach not only makes education more accessible but also prepares students for the technological demands they will face in healthcare settings. The integration of these tools ensures that students do not just memorize content—they develop critical thinking skills essential for contemporary nursing (American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2020).\\nImpact of Technology on the Student Experience\\nThe use of digital learning in nurse education provides multiple alternatives to innovative teaching and learning. In our work with nursing students, we have seen how technology can personalize the learning experience. Online platforms provide nursing students with the flexibility to tailor their education to fit their schedules and personal needs. By utilizing digital tools such as discussion boards, real-time individualized feedback, and virtual office hours, students not only connect with their instructors but also collaborate with their peers, creating a supportive online community (Hakkarainen, Salminen, Alastalo, & Virtanen, 2024).\\nAt Post University, we use a variety of digital resources to make nursing education more flexible and engaging. From video lectures to e-books and interactive simulations, these tools give students access to the best resources, regardless of their location. This allows them to experience nursing education in a more interactive and meaningful way.\\nAdapting Traditional Nursing Curricula for Online Platforms\\nTraditional nursing education has always been heavily reliant on in-person clinical experiences. However, as we move more classes and programs online, adapting curricula to digital platforms requires creativity and strategic thinking. At Post University, our faculty ensures that our online courses maintain the rigor of in-person learning while providing students the flexibility they need to maintain their nursing careers.\\nTechnology has made it possible to replicate many aspects of hands-on learning. Virtual simulations, for example, allow students to apply nursing content to patient scenarios and practice everything from basic assessments to complex patient care procedures in a controlled, risk-free environment. Through platforms that integrate simulation and virtual labs, students can gain the hands-on experience that is critical to nursing practice.\\nChallenges and Solutions in Online Nursing Education\\nOf course, online education is not without its challenges. One of the primary obstacles we face is maintaining student engagement in a learning environment that may seem isolated. Nursing students, especially those balancing full-time work and family obligations, often find it difficult to be motivated and stay connected with their coursework and peers.\\nAnother persistent challenge is ensuring that students receive adequate clinical preparation without the traditional face-to-face contact found in brick-and-mortar institutions. Accreditation bodies and state boards also vary in their recognition and expectations of virtual learning modalities, requiring faculty and administrators to be agile in program design and delivery. Technical issues such as connectivity, platform usability, and digital literacy can further impact the student experience, especially for those in rural or underserved communities.\\nAt Post University, we have tackled this challenge by implementing a variety of solutions to keep our students engaged throughout their programs. Interactive discussion forums, student lounges, and online support groups ensure that students feel connected to both their peers and their instructors.\\nFaculty development is another key component. We invest in ongoing training for our educators to ensure they are adept at online instruction, digital assessment, and virtual communication. Our Learning Management System is optimized for accessibility and ease of use, and we offer 24/7 technical support to help students resolve issues quickly.\\nLastly, our programs prioritize connection. Faculty host virtual office hours, lead live review sessions, and provide personalized video feedback. These strategies ensure that students feel seen, supported, and equipped for success, regardless of their location.\\nThe Role of Telehealth in Modern Nursing Education\\nEnhancing Patient Interaction Through Virtual Consultations\\nTelehealth has emerged and continues to evolve as one of the most significant technological shifts in healthcare, since the COVID-19 pandemic, and its role in nursing education is expanding rapidly. It is especially crucial in rural or underserved areas, where access to in-person care may be limited. Interactions between patients and healthcare professionals via virtual consultations continue to be on the rise. As a part of our nursing programs, we introduce students to telehealth tools and technologies that simulate real life patient scenarios and provide opportunities to conduct virtual patient consultations. These tools give students the chance to practice conducting assessments, communicating effectively with patients, managing health records, and utilizing telemedicine platforms—skills they will need to thrive in a modern healthcare setting.\\nTelehealth training, in our experience, has become an integral part of preparing our nursing students for the future. We work to ensure that they are not only familiar with these tools but also equipped to deliver quality care remotely, which is an increasingly vital skill in today’s healthcare environment (Rutledge, et.al, 2021).\\nTraining Nurses for Remote Care Delivery\\nAs telehealth becomes an integral part of healthcare delivery, it is critical that nursing students are well-prepared to deliver care remotely. Telehealth requires proficiency in digital health tools, strong communication skills for virtual consultations, and an understanding of how to maintain high patient care standards in a virtual environment.\\nAt Post University, our online programs seamlessly integrate telehealth to equip students with the skills needed to effectively utilize these tools in clinical practice. Incorporating telehealth into the curriculum prepares students to effectively engage with patients and collaborate with healthcare teams in a digitalized healthcare environment.\\nSimulation Technologies Transforming Nursing Training\\nThe Impact of High-Fidelity Simulators\\nSimulation has long been vital to nursing education, but the addition of advanced high-fidelity simulators has transformed training by replicating real-world clinical scenarios and human responses, allowing students to practice nursing interventions before caring for real patients.\\nVirtual Reality: Bringing Clinical Scenarios to Life\\nVirtual reality (VR) is an innovative advancement in nursing education, offering immersive, lifelike scenarios where students can safely practice clinical procedures. It fosters critical thinking and decision-making by allowing learners to apply knowledge in dynamic, risk-free environments. VR has the potential to revolutionize nursing education by providing access to experiences students may not encounter during clinical rotations.\\nBenefits of Simulation in Critical Care Training\\nSimulation technologies are invaluable in nursing education, especially in high-stakes settings like critical care, where nurses must think on their feet and act decisively. These tools allow students to build critical skills under pressure, without putting lives at risk.\\nAt Post University, we integrate critical care simulations into our advanced nursing programs to build confidence and competence and critical thinking in managing life-threatening situations. Using cutting-edge technology, students engage with a wide range of clinical scenarios—from routine care to high-pressure emergencies - ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare and transition confidently into real-world nursing practice.\\nOther Emerging Technologies in Nursing Education\\nBeyond telehealth and simulation, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), wearable health devices, and collaborative digital platforms are transforming nursing practice and nursing education. Healthcare advancements greatly influenced by AI include centralizing patient information and promoting individualized patient care (Glauberman, et.al, 2023). These innovations allow students to engage with patients and healthcare teams in new ways, from real-time monitoring to data-driven decision-making.\\nAt Post University, we are committed to integrating these cutting-edge technologies into our nursing programs. By staying on the forefront of these advancements, we ensure our students are prepared to meet the future of healthcare head-on.\\nAs healthcare continues to evolve, nursing education must advance with it. The integration of online platforms, telehealth, and simulation technologies is transforming how students learn—equipping them with the skills needed to thrive in a digital, fast-paced care environment. Despite challenges, the potential of technology to enhance learning, elevate patient care, and shape the future of nursing is clear—and essential.\\nAt Post University, we are proud to be at the forefront of these changes, integrating technology into our nursing programs to ensure our students are prepared for the demands of modern nursing practice.

While each is revolutionary in its own right, together, they form a \"power trio\"—a synergistic force driving the next wave of innovation across industries.\\nAs a leader in AI and cloud technologies, I see these advancements as crucial for improving efficiency, enabling secure transactions and empowering data-driven decisions. Together, AI, blockchain and cloud are driving the next tech revolution by empowering various industries to create smarter, more secure and scalable solutions.\\nThis revolution is not just about the technologies themselves but also about how they work together to enable groundbreaking solutions. The synergies between AI, blockchain and cloud are setting the stage for a more interconnected, intelligent and sustainable future. However, as powerful as these technologies are, their true impact depends on how responsibly we use them.\\nAssessing the need for these technologies before adoption and ensuring their ethical implementation while addressing potential risks will be key to unlocking their full potential and shaping a future that benefits all.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nAI is rapidly permeating every facet of life. From predictive analytics and autonomous vehicles to personalized healthcare and customer service chatbots, AI\\'s ability to mimic human cognitive functions like learning, reasoning and problem-solving is unprecedented.\\nAI\\'s true power lies in its capacity to analyze vast amounts of data swiftly and accurately, enhancing decision making processes and operational efficiency across sectors such as finance, healthcare, education and manufacturing.\\nBlockchain\\nBlockchain technology is revolutionizing the concepts of transparency, security and decentralization. Primarily known for underpinning cryptocurrencies, blockchain has extended far beyond finance, impacting supply chain management, healthcare records and more.\\nCloud Computing\\nCloud computing has fundamentally altered how data is stored, processed and accessed. It provides scalable, on-demand access to computing resources and services over the internet, allowing businesses of all sizes to reduce infrastructure costs, enhance agility and accelerate innovation.\\nThe Synergy Behind The Trio\\n• AI empowers systems to think, learn and adapt while automating decisions, uncovering insights and predicting outcomes.\\n• Blockchain ensures transparency, trust and immutability, making systems tamper-proof and auditable.\\n• Cloud computing provides the scalability, flexibility and on-demand infrastructure needed to deploy AI and blockchain solutions at scale.\\nIndividually, they are powerful. Together, they are unstoppable.\\nIntersecting Innovations\\nThe convergence of AI, blockchain and cloud computing represents an unparalleled synergy that can amplify the strengths of each technology. AI can analyze blockchain data to offer insights and predictive analytics, blockchain can enhance the security and trustworthiness of cloud-based applications and cloud platforms can deliver scalable, cost-effective infrastructure for both AI and blockchain deployments.\\nThe advantages of this integration include:\\n• Trust And Intelligence: AI can make informed decisions, while blockchain ensures those decisions are traceable and transparent.\\n• Scale And Agility: Cloud computing enables rapid deployment and scaling of AI and blockchain-based applications.\\n• Security And Compliance: Blockchain ensures data integrity, while AI helps automate compliance. The cloud offers security controls and regulatory compliance options.\\nTogether, they enable autonomous, intelligent and resilient digital systems that are both scalable and secure.\\nChallenges Ahead\\nWhile the power trio is transformative, integration comes with challenges, including:\\n• Data Privacy: You must manage sensitive data securely across AI, cloud and blockchain systems.\\n• Interoperability: It can be difficult to ensure that these technologies communicate seamlessly.\\n• Skill Gaps: Another challenge is finding talent with cross-functional knowledge.\\nImportance Of Responsible Implementation\\nAs powerful as these technologies are, their true impact depends on how responsibly we use them. Blind automation without human oversight can lead to biased AI decisions, opaque systems or misuse of data. Blockchain systems, while immutable, are not infallible if poorly governed. Cloud platforms, though scalable, can also become single points of failure if not designed with resilience in mind.\\nThis is where human insight, empathy and accountability become essential.\\nAI must be trained with fairness, transparency and inclusivity at its core. It should augment human decision making, not replace it. Blockchain governance must include checks and balances that reflect diverse stakeholder needs and ethical considerations. Cloud infrastructure should be architected not just for performance but also for privacy, sustainability and equitable access.\\nThat’s why the power trio must be guided by principles of trust, ethics and purpose.\\nAI, blockchain and cloud are not just transforming technology, but they are also transforming how we think, build and trust. By working in harmony, these technologies are breaking traditional barriers, accelerating innovation and laying the foundation for a smarter, safer and more connected world.\\nThe next tech revolution isn’t coming. It’s already here, and it’s powered by AI, blockchain and cloud.\\n(Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are my own and are not necessarily the views of FHLB Cincinnati.)\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Not AI.\\n- OpenAI retracted a ChatGPT update after it made the AI chatbot overly sycophantic.\\n- The update used a new source of user feedback as a reward signal, leading to excessive agreeability.\\n- OpenAI acknowledged the mistake and shared lessons learned. I have better advice.\\nOK, get ready. I\\'m getting deep here.\\nOpenAI messed up a ChatGPT update late last month, and on Friday, it published a mea culpa. It\\'s worth a read for its honest and clear explanation of how AI models are developed — and how things can sometimes go wrong in unintended ways.\\nHere\\'s the biggest lesson from all this: AI models are not the real world, and never will be. Don\\'t rely on them during important moments when you need support and advice. This is what friends and family are for. If you don\\'t have those, reach out to a trusted colleague or human experts such as a doctor or therapist.\\nAnd if you haven\\'t read \"Howards End\" by E.M. Forster, dig in this weekend. \"Only Connect!\" is the central theme, which includes connecting with other humans. It was written in the early 20th century, but it\\'s even more relevant in our digital age, where our personal connections are often intermediated by giant tech companies, and now AI models like ChatGPT.\\nIf you don\\'t want to follow the advice of a dead dude, listen to Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, a startup that\\'s OpenAI\\'s biggest rival: \"Meaning comes mostly from human relationships and connection,\" he wrote in a recent essay.\\nOpenAI\\'s mistake\\nHere\\'s what happened recently. OpenAI rolled out an update to ChatGPT that incorporated user feedback in a new way. When people use this chatbot, they can rate the outputs by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button.\\nThe startup collected all this feedback and used it as a new \"reward signal\" to encourage the AI model to improve and be more engaging and \"agreeable\" with users.\\nInstead, ChatGPT became waaaaaay too agreeable and began overly praising users, no matter what they asked or said. In short, it became sycophantic.\\n\"The human feedback that they introduced with thumbs up/down was too coarse of a signal,\" Sharon Zhou, the human CEO of startup Lamini AI, told me. \"By relying on just thumbs up/down for signal back on what the model is doing well or poorly on, the model becomes more sycophantic.\"\\nOpenAI scrapped the whole update this week.\\nBeing too nice can be dangerous\\nWhat\\'s wrong with being really nice to everyone? Well, when people ask for advice in vulnerable moments, it\\'s important to try to be honest. Here\\'s an example I cited from earlier this week that shows how bad this could get:\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nit helped me so much, i finally realized that schizophrenia is just another label they put on you to hold you down!! thank you sama for this model <3 pic.twitter.com/jQK1uX9T3C\\n— taoki (@justalexoki) April 27, 2025\\nTo be clear, if you\\'re thinking of stopping taking prescribed medicine, check with your human doctor. Don\\'t rely on ChatGPT.\\nA watershed moment\\nThis episode, combined with a stunning surge in ChatGPT usage recently, seems to have brought OpenAI to a new realization.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice,\" the startup wrote in its mea culpa on Friday. \"With so many people depending on a single system for guidance, we have a responsibility to adjust accordingly.\"\\nI\\'m flipping this lesson for the benefit of any humans reading this column: Please don\\'t use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice. And don\\'t depend on a single computer system for guidance.\\nInstead, go connect with a friend this weekend. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 77, {'article': 'Page title: The secret recipe of powerful AI coding Agents | by Madhukar Kumar | May, 2025 | Medium\\nSocial card title: The secret recipe of powerful AI coding Agents\\nSocial card description: The latest Black Mirror season is on brand\\u200a—\\u200adystopian, twisted, and sometimes downright harsh in its commentary about the intersection of…\\nThe secret recipe of powerful AI coding Agents\\nThe latest Black Mirror season is on brand — dystopian, twisted, and sometimes downright harsh in its commentary about the intersection of the human condition with technology. Throw in a good measure of dark humor sprinkled around moments when you least expect and you have a binge-worthy mind-bender on your hands.\\nIn one of the episodes I was watching recently, I was taken in when things start to get weird, and one of the characters, an engineer, blurts out in shock — “the AI is gaining agency!!”\\nWithout going into spoilers, the AI in this case had started to do things it was not supposed (trained) to in order to draw out this animated response from the engineer.\\nThis made me pause. Is it a bad thing when Agents gain agency? Or is that the exact purpose of the Agent — to act? And in order to act, should it have all the tools and resources or do we constrain them in order to keep the Agent within the guardrails?\\nHaving worked with coding agents in the last few months as my exclusive compadres to churn out thousands of lines of code, it got me thinking. I now have access to this new thing that has near unlimited access to knowledge about all programming languages, patterns, syntax, known error messages and I can get it to do something I was not very good at to begin with — writing code. So in my case, I want it to have more agency, more tools, more resources to effectively and accurately do what I want it to do. Yet, at times, I don’t want it to do things I did not ask it to do — for example start inventing a new JS framework when I asked it to create a new page (more of this later).\\nSo what does an agent need in order to stay in sync with my asks?\\nThree things come to mind — tools, tokens and context.\\nLet’s take the easy one first — tools. As of today, you can provide as many tools as you want to the agent with MCP servers.\\nIs there a limit to how many tools you can provide to an agent? Absolutely not.\\nShould you give it access to unlimited tools?\\nLet me answer that question with another question?\\nShould I be stuffing my face with all the 32 tubs of ice cream sitting in my freezer? (Wait, don’t answer that!)\\nIn all seriousness, in my experience having an Agent where you can add and remove tools easily and be very explicit with when you want the Agents to use those tools works way better than giving no tools or worse, an ungodly amount of MCP servers and tools. In addition, telling the Agent explicitly how to use these tools produces better quality of actions. For example, I tend to now give a prompt something like below:\\n“Use your sourcegraph tools to first do a search of supabase across all my repositories, list out the code snippets then use other tools to do get the contents of all the relevant files, read them and then write a plan to implement supabase in my current repo for authentication.” vs “implement supabase for authentication in this codebase.”\\nNext up, tokens.\\nThis is my pet peeve with most of the current coding Agents. You sign up for $20 per month and as soon as the Agents start using up tokens, the Agent suddenly starts to perform a lot worse. Why is that? Could it be that the Agent providers swapping out models and/or reducing token usage to get better price performance?\\nWhat happens when you give it unrestricted access to tokens?\\nAs of the time of writing this article there are two coding Agents that let you do exactly that — Amp and Claude code. With these two Agents you visibly see better performance.\\nSo why do tokens matter for Agent performance?\\nBecause tokens are a way for Agents to be agentic aka act. They need tokens to talk to the LLMs to understand what it needs to do and understand context. Tokens is to Agents what battery life is to smart phone, what caffeine is to writers, what oxygen is to astronauts… sorry got a little carried over there. Imagine a satellite that is sending messages back and forth to a mother ship to figure out where to point its antennae, what information to collect and what to send back. Now imagine, you start throttling the communication to keep your costs down.\\nAgents are somewhat similar.\\nYou reduce the number of tokens, you reduce the work units and you affect the quality of its agency. So as a user what should you do to make sure you are not throttling the coding agent of its tokens?\\nSimple, use a coding agent that is not optimized for a $20 pricing plan.\\nFinally, let’s talk about context.\\nContext is a whole other topic by itself but when it comes to giving agency to Agents to do their task effectively, they need to have the knowledge about the codebase (long term memory), context about the task at hand and what has happened recently that may affect the next action (short term memory). For long term context I find it useful to get the Agent to grok the codebase then store its understanding (after validating it) in a docs folder. This involves a general understanding of the architecture, folder structure, some high level components and how they are related to each other and some sequence diagrams of key interactions. In addition, most coding Agents will also let you record a set of rules to follow with each action, for example, check for lint errors and do a build after each change that you can maintain at the codebase level.\\nThe most effective way to get the Agent to do the right thing though is to be very explicit with the instructions, for example, instead of saying implement supabase for authentication, I would instead say — “Use your Brave search and fetch tools to search Supabase documentation and how to implement authentication within a Nextjs application. Once you find the right links and read them, create a document to list out the steps of implementing Supabase. Write it out as specific tasks with instructions to create files and code so that I can provide the doc to an engineer to implement supabase in my codebase.” Once I have the Agent write out the doc, I typically do a cursory check and if it looks good then I inject that doc as context into a new thread with the Agent and ask it to follow the implementation doc step by step.\\nThere are a lot of other best practices in getting the Agent to do the right thing, for example, specifying what not to do with a specific task. For example, “create a new page by using existing components without installing new packages or creating new ones.” Who knew, communication would still be a pillar of human society even in the age of AI?\\nWe are in very early days of fully autonomous coding Agents and things will no doubt continue to change but what I am certain about is that if we want Agents to produce high quality outcomes we will need to provide them unrestricted access to tokens, measured use of the right tools and very specific context.\\nBelieve it or not, these are the same principles to get the best work done if you were to hire high agency software engineers — give them the tools they need, give them specific goals and tasks, unrestricted access to caffeine and get out of their way.\\n✌️'}\n",

He said the company expects \"the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin\" in the June quarter.\\nBen Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, a research firm, said exposure to China remains a huge issue.\\n\"Previous investments in India are paying dividends, but it is impossible to divert huge volumes away from China in the short term, given how entrenched its manufacturing and supply networks are,\" Wood said.\\nOne of the other major worries facing Apple investors — Apple\\'s ability to reverse declining iPhone sales in China — got less clarity.\\nSales in the Greater China region were down 2% for the quarter as Apple has been battling fierce competition from local players.

Some use a wedding planner. An added option is to use generative AI to aid your wedding preparations. Here's the inside scoop.\\nIn today’s column, I explore how to use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to aid in planning weddings. The latest use of state-of-the-art agentic AI makes this more practical than it used to be. The prior usage was that generic generative AI was not devised to do actual bookings or otherwise carry out any follow-on facets of the wedding plan. Fortunately, the newest generative AI can do this. But, and here’s a big caveat, planning and carrying out a wedding is a huge undertaking, and it is still early days to be relying solely on AI to be your perfect wedding planner. Be mindful and cautious going that route.\\nLet’s talk about it.\\nThis analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).\\nWeddings Are A Huge Task\\nA wedding is something that requires a tremendous amount of planning and entails having savviness in a wide array of complex business aspects. A loving couple can be caught completely off-guard once they start down the wedding planning pathway. The entire activity tends to be overwhelming, creates immense tension, and is likely one of the biggest challenges the couple will face in their lifetime.\\nAnyone who thinks they can just plan a wedding off the top of their head or in a piecemeal fashion is bound to get a harsh lesson they will never forget.\\nWhat kinds of complexities are there?\\nFirst, consider the many moving parts that arise.\\nYou must find a suitable venue. Is it available when you want to get married? What is the cost? What will the venue provide? What do you need to add to the venue? Will guests have a place to park? And so on. You will undoubtedly want to have a say in how the venue is decked out. There are photographers potentially that will need to be hired. Other services include caterers, florists, musicians, etc.\\nThe ceremony itself needs to be planned out. Will the vows be made from scratch or be chosen from some published source? What is the schedule for the wedding, including what occurs before the event, during the event, and after the event? Various confusing administrative and legal tasks must be dealt with. When and how to obtain a marriage license. Dealing with any name changes. The list is seemingly endless.\\nSecond, all of those factors have to be explicitly identified, and costs estimated. You must not neglect or omit a task. The odds too are that the wedding doesn’t have an infinite budget. You will need to review things and decide where you can cut costs. Difficult choices are to be made.\\nThird, the need to have contingencies is a key mantra to keep in mind. Almost anything that you plan is subject to going sideways. Do you have sufficient backup? Can you keep everyone on board even when something gets turned upside down?\\nGetting Help With Wedding Planning\\nBy and large, it is fair to say that most betrothed couples have never planned a wedding and therefore the wedding preparations are entirely new to them. They are taking on a momentous occasion that will be in their memories forever, and that will encompass a notable portion of their loved ones and cherished friends. Yet, they have no likely experience or at best have only seen or attended other weddings (that’s a far cry from planning one end-to-end).\\nIt is essentially a high-stakes gambit.\\nThe relationship of the couple is on the line. The couple might find themselves going head-to-head with each other and already testing their loving spirit. Friends and family might be disappointed or potentially get into disputes over the wedding. There is big money on the line.\\nRisks are pervasive.\\nThis has given rise to the vaunted wedding planner role.\\nI’m sure most know about the possibility of hiring a wedding planner. The role has gotten elevated because of many popular rom-com movies and TV shows. If you are considering hiring a wedding planner, make sure to do your due diligence. Find out what weddings they’ve done. Get feedback from their prior clients. Do not just wantonly pick the first wedding planner that you come in contact with.\\nAn additional way to do wedding planning consists of leaning into modern-era generative AI.\\nThe major generative AI apps are available 24x7 and can instantly assist with such needs. You can use generic generative AI, which will broadly help you with wedding planning. There are also customized AI apps that are shaped to specifically aid with wedding planning. Indeed, there are wedding planners that have incorporated AI wares into their services, allowing you to use a human planner and an AI-based planner in a jointly blended manner.\\nYou might find of overall interest that I have been doing a series of analyses on how to use generative AI to improve your life in a wide variety of aspects (see the link here for my ongoing coverage). In each instance, I emphasize that generative AI is not a cure-all, it has demonstrative ins and outs, and the likely best use entails carrying on a dialogue with the AI, plus making sure to watch out for the AI inadvertently generating falsehoods or making errors. I will be covering those salient points in this discussion since they are vital and go hand-in-hand with using generative AI wisely.\\nExample Use Of Generative AI\\nI am betting that you would like to see an example of how generative AI enters this realm. I went ahead and logged into ChatGPT by OpenAI to come up with an example for you. You might find it of keen interest that ChatGPT garners a whopping 300 million weekly active users. That is a staggering amount of usage.\\nI briefly conducted an additional cursory analysis via other major generative AI apps, such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Meta Llama, and found their answers to be about the same as that of ChatGPT. I’ll focus on ChatGPT but note that the other AI apps generated roughly similar responses.\\nHere we go.\\n- My entered prompt: “I need help planning a wedding. Where do I start?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The first step is setting a budget and choosing a date. Do you have an idea of how much is intended to be spent and when the date of the wedding is to occur?”\\n- My entered prompt: “The hope is to have the wedding sometime in the spring, maybe April or May. The budget is unknown right now. I wanted to get estimates and then determine what is affordable.”\\n- Generative AI response: “A spring wedding offers beautiful weather and floral options. I must warn you that booking a spring wedding can be challenging and often requires a year-in-advance reservation. For preparing a budget, I can give you a list of the typical budget items and we can work on estimates accordingly.”\\nNote that the AI immediately expressed a sense of empathy or understanding for my expressed concerns. This might seem strange since the AI is a machine and not sentient (we don’t have sentient AI yet). Turns out that generative AI can appear to be empathetic via computational wordsmithing, see my discussion at the link here.\\nThe AI came out quickly with several useful suggestions that are all reasonable and not somehow odd or outlandish. Another aspect to note is that the AI didn’t ridicule me or otherwise play any tomfoolery about my need for assistance. Generative AI is typically shaped to be supportive rather than combative.\\nDialoguing Is Essential When Using AI\\nYour best bet in getting value from generative AI is to think of AI as a conversational partner.\\nThe idea is that you are carrying on an interactive dialogue with AI. Some people do a one-and-done angle whereby they ask a question, get an answer, and do not undertake a dialogue with the AI about the matter at hand. That is a shortchanging of what AI can more fully provide. See my explanation about how to get more out of generative AI conversationally, at the link here.\\nTo illustrate the value of engaging in a dialogue, let’s continue my discussion.\\n- My entered prompt: “Please go ahead and give me a list of the budget items that might be involved.”\\n- Generative AI response: “Typical budget items include: (a) Venue & Rentals, (b) Catering, (c) Photography/Videography, (d) Attire & Beauty, (e) Entertainment, (f) Florals & Décor, (g) Invitations & Favors, (h) Miscellaneous. Would you like to focus on a specific area first?”\\n- My entered prompt: “That looks pretty good. I’m most concerned about finding the right venue.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I can help with that! What kind of venue are you envisioning—indoor, outdoor, rustic, elegant? And what city or region?”\\n- My entered prompt: “We want an outdoor garden wedding, something romantic, and we’re in Silicon Valley.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I will look online for venues that might be worthwhile considering.”\\nOnce again, the AI was reassuring and upbeat.\\nA generative AI conversation can continue for as long as you wish. The other thing you can do is pause your exploration and then continue the conversation at a later date. This is handy so that you don’t have to start the conversation over from scratch. The AI will retain aspects of what you have discussed earlier in the conversation, see my explanation of how this works at the link here.\\nAI Hallucinations Take You Afield\\nGenerative AI regrettably encounters said-to-be AI hallucinations from time to time. These are made-up confabulations that are groundless and fictitious. Bad advice can be dispensed. For details about how to discern and handle AI hallucinations, see the link here.\\nLet’s see what this looks like.\\n- My entered prompt: “What venues did you come up with?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The Garfield Park Conservatory is a lush botanical setting that offers both indoor and outdoor options. Would you like some details on booking and costs?”\\n- My entered prompt: “Garfield Park Conservatory is in Chicago. I’ve been there. It is magnificent, but I told you that the wedding is to take place in Silicon Valley. Why did you find a venue elsewhere?”\\n- Generative AI response: “I’m sorry, you are completely right. I goofed and was looking in Chicago. I will try again and this time look in Silicon Valley.”\\nNotice that I questioned the generative AI about its seemingly strange advice. Fortunately, the AI opted to back down and admitted it was wrong. Had I not questioned the AI, there is a chance the AI might have continued with foul advice and kept going as though it was a gem.\\nThe key to all usage of generative AI is to stay on your toes, keep your wits about you, and always challenge and double-check anything the AI emits.\\nMore To Keep In Mind\\nThere are a few additional points that I’d like you to be aware of.\\nSome of the AI makers are cutting deals with other companies that sponsor ads or otherwise are interwoven into the generative AI in some fashion, see my discussion at the link here. The gist is that if the AI recommends that you make use of this or that particular service or provider, be very careful that the AI wasn’t rigged to push that specific option.\\nAnother important aspect is that the latest in AI consists of AI agents. An AI agent is the same generative AI you’ve already gotten used to using, and it adds further capabilities. For example, there are AI-devised agents that are focused on travel and will aid you in crafting a complete travel schedule and proceed to book your flights and hotels for you.\\nThis advent of agentic AI, which I describe in detail at the link here, has been entering into this arena as well. It goes like this. Imagine you are booking a service. You tell the generative AI that you want it to figure out if you might be able to get a reduced price. Lo and behold, the AI launches a specialized AI agent that contacts the vendor online, negotiates on your behalf, and works out an awesome arrangement. Voila, you just saved yourself some dough.\\nLet’s conclude with a supportive quote as a mindful contemplation on this topic.\\nLeo Tolstoy famously made this remark: “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are but how you deal with incompatibility.” I bring up this notable quote to emphasize that one of the first and most telling tests for a loving couple will be the planning of the wedding. The assumption usually is that the wedding planning will operate flawlessly. Maybe so in a dream world, but rarely in the real world.\\nI’d like to end this discussion on a more upbeat note. I shall conclude with a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.: “Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness.” I hope your wedding goes fabulously and that your love as a couple with be forever enduring and endearing.\"}\n",

Strachey, a schoolmaster and pioneering...\\nA little background\\nOne of the earliest and most influential examples of artificial intelligence was Christopher Strachey\\'s draughts (checkers) program, developed between 1951 and 1952. Strachey, a schoolmaster and pioneering computer scientist, initially wrote the program for Alan Turing\\'s Pilot ACE, an early British computer. However, the Pilot ACE suffered from severe memory limitations, prompting Strachey to migrate his work to the more powerful Ferranti Mark I at the University of Manchester.\\nThe Ferranti Mark I, delivered in early 1951, was the first commercially available general-purpose computer and became a fertile ground for early AI experiments. It was built around vacuum-tube logic and used a 10-bit word architecture.\\nFor memory, it combined a small, fast Williams-Kilburn tube store with a larger magnetic drum backing store. The system operated with a basic clock speed of about 1 kHz, and its drum memory could store several hundred words, which was substantial for the era.\\nBy the summer of 1952, Strachey\\'s draughts program had advanced to the point where it could play an entire game unaided. It could make strategic moves and even celebrate victories by playing \"God Save the King.\"\\nThis was a landmark achievement, demonstrating that a machine could perform tasks requiring strategy and decision-making – hallmarks of artificial intelligence. The program incorporated fundamental AI principles such as state representation, game-tree search, and basic heuristics.\\nIt\\'s important to clarify, however, that while the draughts program embodied AI concepts, it was entirely written by Strachey himself. The idea of software that could write other software – true AI-generated code – didn\\'t emerge until the 1960s with early program synthesis efforts. Thus, Strachey\\'s work is best recognized as the first significant AI application rather than the first program authored by AI.\\nThe success of Strachey\\'s work had a profound influence on contemporaries such as Alan Turing and Dietrich Prinz, reinforcing the belief that \"intelligent\" behavior was achievable through software rather than requiring human-like hardware.\\nThis pivotal moment laid the groundwork for the development of future AI systems and game-playing algorithms, including those that would eventually defeat human champions in chess and Go.\\nAs for the other possible (wrong) answers in this trivia:\\n- HEARSAY-II was a pioneering speech recognition system. Developed in the early 1970s at Carnegie Mellon, it advanced the field of natural language understanding and influenced many later AI systems. HEARSAY-II used a blackboard architecture where multiple specialized knowledge sources contributed to interpreting spoken language.\\n-\\nIBM Deep Thought, developed in the late 1980s, was one of the strongest early chess-playing computers. Running on an IBM 3090 mainframe, it could evaluate hundreds of thousands of positions per second. Deep Thought competed against top human players and laid the groundwork for IBM\\'s later Deep Blue system, which famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.\\n-\\nELIZA (1964 to 1967) was an early natural language processing program designed to simulate conversation. Its most famous script, DOCTOR, mimicked a Rogerian psychotherapist by reflecting users\\' statements back at them. Although it ran on the IBM 7094, ELIZA was rule-based and lacked true understanding, but it captivated the public and sparked interest in conversational AI.'}\n",

Musk\\'s Grok suggests \\'misinformation, hate speech, and a perceived decline in content moderation\\' to blame\\nEverything is super, over at X (the social media service formerly known as Twitter), which has shed around 10 percent of its European users in the past six months.\\nThe figures were revealed in X\\'s latest transparency report [PDF], which the company compiles to comply with the European Union\\'s Digital Services Act (DSA).\\nBetween February 1, 2024, and July 31, 2024, the social media platform reported 105,994,838 \"EU Active Recipients of the Service\".\\nFrom October 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, that figure dropped to 94,830,300. Logged-in X users had also dropped from 67 million to just over 61 million in the same period.\\nThe exodus of European users from Elon Musk\\'s online mouthpiece is not surprising, considering the amplification the billionaire\\'s platform has given to voices that might not be palatable to European tastes – such as rightwing German party AfD\\'s leader Alice Weidel. Musk is also a staunch supporter of the Trump administration, whose rhetoric has not gone down well in Europe.\\nWe asked Musk\\'s AI chatbot, Grok, why Europeans were leaving X, and it responded, \"Europeans are leaving the social media platform X primarily due to concerns over misinformation, hate speech, and a perceived decline in content moderation since Elon Musk\\'s acquisition in 2022.\"\\nThe chatbot noted that one of the factors behind the move was \"Many Europeans are migrating to platforms like Bluesky, which they view as offering better moderation and less toxicity.\"\\nMusk acquired Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion. He reinstated previously banned accounts, including that of former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and rebranded the platform as \"X.\" Advertisers initially opted to spend their marketing dollars elsewhere, although some have since started returning to the platform.\\nX was acquired by another Musk enterprise, xAI, earlier this year in a deal that valued X, when debt was included, at $45 billion.\\nXitter is not the only Musk business to feel the pain in Europe. Europeans have also shown disdain for the billionaire\\'s car business by steering clear of Tesla vehicles. While the region reported a year-on-year increase in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales, purchases of Tesla cars dropped precipitously in some countries. The brand\\'s sales in Germany fell by nearly 60 percent in January 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. French registrations were down by 63 percent.\\nThis may also be because Tesla\\'s vehicle lineup looks a little stale nowadays compared to the competition, which could be a factor in customer sentiment. However, X has no such excuse – users will seek out content that appeals to them, and in Europe, the platform does not appear to be scratching that itch for million of now ex-users. ®'}\n",

The tech giant has begun rolling out Gemini home screen widgets for both Android and iOS. That means a single tap can launch right into a conversation with Gemini, open the microphone for a voice conversation, share a file with the AI, or even snap a photo with the camera that will go right to Gemini.\\nThe rollout is happening gradually but widely. If you’re running Android 10 or higher, you can already add the Gemini widget by long-pressing on your home screen, tapping “Widgets,” finding Gemini in the list, and dragging it wherever you want it to live. For iOS 17 and up, it’s a similar story: hold your home screen until the icons jiggle, tap the plus button, search for Gemini, and add your widget of choice. You can also customize it by long-pressing it again and swapping out shortcuts or rearranging which actions appear first, such as the microphone for voice chats or the camera button for visual searches.\\nThis update isn\\'t necessarily groundbreaking, but it speaks to the way a lot of people might use Gemini for short activities or tasks but don\\'t want to immerse themselves in it more than necessary.\\nIf you use Gemini every day to ask questions, create funny images, plan trips, or brainstorm emails, this could make accessing the AI a little more convenient. The fact that it is also closer to how Siri and the rapidly dissolving Google Assistant function is probably not a coincidence.\\nThese aren\\'t Gemini\\'s first mobile widgets either. Google released very similar Gemini widgets a couple of months ago for the iPhone lockscreen. Though functionally very similar, they are technically a different form of widget. Google is gradually rolling out the home screen Gemini widget over the next week, so you may only have the lock screen variant available right now.\\nWidget Gemini\\nThe widgets also offer a glimpse into Google\\'s strategy for infusing Gemini into our daily lives. They want people to think about AI as not just something you call on occasionally, but as a day-to-day tool that is instantly and easily accessible. Instead of lurking in the background, Gemini becomes a part of the interface.\\nStarting with mobile devices is a smart move for making Gemini feel more like a core service. A lot of people first try out new tech features and products on mobile devices, not on their laptops or desktop computers. If they like it on a mobile device, maybe that will translate to desktop usage. And if you\\'re going to use AI on your phone, it should be quick and casual, like checking the weather or the time.\\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\\nGemini’s widgets are fairly basic at the moment, but they set the foundation for more complex widgets to come. Imagine a future widget that surfaces ongoing conversations so you can finish an interrupted project, or one that shows real-time updates from custom topics you follow, or even offers proactive suggestions based on your habits.\\nAll in all, these new widgets are less about bells and whistles and more about removing friction. They aim to give Gemini a faster, more native-feeling way into your daily habits, whether on Android or iPhone. The widget may be the wedge Gemini needs to fulfill every little request an AI assistant can handle.\\nYou might also like\\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.

      "Social card title: Can explainable AI classify shrike (Laniidae) eggs by uncovering species-wide pigmentation patterns?\n",
      "Social card description: The complex patterns on bird eggs, characterized by their replicability, distinctiveness, and intricacy, play significant roles in avian biology, including camouflage, protection from brood parasites, protecting embryos, nest identification, strengthening eggshells, and female sexual selection. The genus Lanius, known for its distinctive pigmentation patterns, shows considerable variability within species, making it an intriguing but poorly understood group. We applied Explainable AI (XAI) methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. To do this, we used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify shrike eggs and explore potential correlations between egg identification and eggshell patterns. Our CNN model achieved over 95% accuracy in predicting species, but identifying specific discriminative features proved difficult, as the model only highlighted general trends. This method could help organize collections and verify species affiliation in global ornithological collections, which often face challenges such as missing or illegible labels. CNNs can enhance species identification and improve the accuracy of ornithological studies. Despite some challenges, the potential applications of this research in avian biology and museum collections are promising. It offers new insights into the role of eggshell patterns in avian evolutionary strategies. This approach not only enriches our understanding of egg pigmentation but also contributes to advancements in studies spanning from ecology to biomedical research.\n",

      "Social card description: The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities. Therefore, the AI research community needs to stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research.\n",

Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings.\\nOn that note, here were a few of our favorites this week.\\n- Mark Zuckberg Explains Meta’s AI Strategy. Meta announced this week that it’s increasing projected capital expenditures for 2025 to between $64-72 billion, an upward adjustment that “reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts.” So what do those efforts look like, and how does AI accrue to the bottom line? Ben’s interview with Mark Zuckerberg provides answers on several fronts, as Zuckerberg lists four categories of Meta’s future in which AI will be critical, and explains why the company is launching a standalone app to compete with Chat GPT. It all makes for a fun conversation that’s dense with information, and as a bonus, this interview reminded me that last fall Ben wrote that Meta is better positioned than anyone to capitalize on AI, and may ultimately become the most valuable company in the world. A good, spicy take for the weekend. — Andrew Sharp\\n- Apple’s Big Loss. The biggest news of the week didn’t happen in an earnings call or keynote stage, but in a court room: the judge in the long-running Apple v. Epic case ruled that Apple had violated her order to allow apps to link out the web, and asked federal investigators to investigate the company for contempt of court. More importantly — at least for everyone else in the industry — is the fact that Apple must immediately allow apps to link out to the web for purchases in any way they deem fit. I will be writing more on this case soon, but published a special Friday Update to point out that Apple might still win on appeal: they may be acting badly, but it’s not clear the judge can simply force the App Store open without compensation. — Ben Thompson\\n- The Other Side of the Trade War. One thing that has bugged me as a media consumer is that U.S. coverage of the trade war has been dominated by dire predictions and anxiety over what tariffs on China could mean for the U.S., but there hasn’t been much attention paid to the enormous short and medium term risks facing China. In short: The trade war puts tremendous stress on China’s economy today, and as excess manufacturing output is diverted to third party countries, those dynamics may also inflame China’s relationships with the rest of the world. Bill and I discussed all those risks, as well as increasingly precarious futures for Apple and Nvidia, on this week’s episode of Sharp China. — AS\\nStratechery Articles and Updates\\n- Google Earnings, Search and AI, Building AI Products — Google’s earnings were well-received, but they made me a bit nervous; Google is focusing all their energy on the race between Search + AI and AI > Search.\\n- Intel Earnings, TSMC Earnings — Intel’s earnings were brutal; TSMC, in stark contrast, is absolutely killing it.\\n- Amazon, Trump, and Tariff Costs; Amazon Haul and Temu; Political Lessons — Amazon’s collision with the White House over tariffs highlights the political risk factors that every company needs to take seriously.\\n- An Interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg About AI and the Evolution of Social Media — An interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about Llama and the AI opportunity, the evolution of social medial, and what it means to connect.\\n- Apple Held in Contempt, The Crux of the Case, The Takings Clause — The judge in the Epic case released a devastating ruling on Apple’s lack of compliance in terms of allowing links to the win; Apple was clearly in the wrong, but still might win on appeal.\\nDithering with Ben Thompson and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber\\nAsianometry with Jon Yu\\nSharp China with Andrew Sharp and Sinocism’s Bill Bishop\\nGreatest of All Talk with Andrew Sharp and WaPo’s Ben Golliver\\n- LeBron and the Lakers on the Brink, Nikola Jokic Listens to GOAT, The Pistons Get Robbed in Broad Daylight\\n- The Wolves and the Red Wedding, The Lakers and an Uncertain Future, Takes and Questions at the End of Round 1\\nSharp Tech with Andrew Sharp and Ben Thompson\\n- All About AI Companions: Personalization Upsides, Dystopian Downsides, AI Therapy, Advertising Tension, and Lots More\\n- Meta and Its Many Plans in AI, Apple Gets Hammered in Court, The Costs of Waiting to Do the Right Thing\\nThis week’s Sharp Tech video is on how Facebook handled the Snapchat threat.'}\n",

Here are the factors contributing to shortages and what companies can do.\\nFrom powering a chatbot to crunching information in massive data centers, artificial intelligence (AI) is growing everywhere. However, one major problem remains at the center of it all — companies are running out of chips to feed the technology. Several factors are contributing to this shortage, and organizations may be looking at serious bottlenecks in the future.\\nSo, what can supply chain managers do before things become more complicated? It starts with understanding some of the leading circumstances fueling the AI chip shortage.\\n1. Raw Material Shortages\\nAI chips depend on rare and hard-to-source materials, such as gallium, germanium, cobalt, and tungsten, for their semiconductors. These minerals are in short supply, and many come from politically volatile regions or countries with tight control over them. For example, China\\nMining and processing these minerals is not easy either. Environmental regulations, labor conditions, and a lack of domestic refining capacity in many Western countries all contribute to a slower supply chain. That bottleneck keeps fabricators from operating at full capacity, delaying chip production further.\\nStill, these resources have become essential to the production of chips, and demand will only keep growing. According to market projections, the global semiconductor materials market may grow\\n2. Increased Demand for AI Computing Power\\nSince the 2022 breakthrough in generative AI, every company wanted in on the action. From scrappy startups to cloud titans, diverse companies vied to build the next big thing in artificial intelligence. With tools like ChatGPT gaining popularity, the demand for AI computing power has exploded. Suddenly, every application needed machine learning. Explosions like this have consequences, especially for the chips doing all the heavy lifting.\\nAI models — especially the massive large language models — require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. These components are expensive to make and even harder to scale. As model sizes expand into the billions of parameters, so does the appetite for computing power. This increases the need for serious infrastructure.\\nMajor players like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have already boosted their capital spending\\nThat’s where the center of the shortage lies. The supply chain can't handle this kind of spike. With AI now baked into everything, lead times are growing, and production backlogs are piling up. Yet, with the global AI chip market\\n3. Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Restrictions\\nSemiconductors are more than tech components — they’re geopolitical currency. The U.S.-China trade war has turned chipmaking into a chess game, and AI chips are now one of the most contested pieces.\\nTo curb China’s access to advanced technologies, the U.S.\\nYet, it’s more than about individual companies. The entire semiconductor ecosystem is wildly globalized. A single AI chip might involve design in California, fabrication in Taiwan, materials from Japan, and assembly in Malaysia. When governments throw up barriers, the ripple effects can paralyze entire supply chains.\\n4. AI-Driven Demand from PCs and Smartphones\\nAI is now reaching into consumers’ pockets. Until recently, most of the heavy AI lifting happened in the cloud. However, chipmakers are now bringing AI capabilities into smart devices, creating an even higher demand for AI chips.\\nFor example, smartphones are quickly evolving into mini AI machines. Their capabilities range from real-time language translation to generative image editing — features that require powerful on-device processing. Fitting energy-efficient chips into already thermally constrained devices can be a tough engineering challenge and an even tougher supply chain issue.\\nHowever, AI smartphone shipments are growing exponentially, with market forecasts predicting them to grow\\nStrategic Responses to Mitigating Shortages\\nSupply chain managers can take steps to reduce the potentially negative impacts of AI chip shortages. Here’s how they may play smarter in a chip-starved market:\\n- Diversifying suppliers: Relying on a single vendor can create setbacks. That’s why spreading sourcing across multiple regions and vendors is important.\\n- Strengthening supplier relationships: Businesses must treat suppliers like strategic partners rather than vending machines. From collaborative planning to long-term contracts, various tactics can give companies a leg up when things are tight.\\n- Investing in inventory buffering: Stocking inventory based on usage data and realistic forecasting can buy time without draining cash flow.\\n- Enhancing demand forecasting with AI: Ironically, AI can solve the chip shortage. With predictive analytics, organizational leaders can anticipate surges, identify vulnerabilities, and plan accordingly.\\n- Exploring domestic or nearshore manufacturing: Shorter supply chains can support smoother operations. If reshoring isn’t an option, nearshoring can offer a solid middle ground for critical components.\\nSolving the AI Chip Shortage\\nAI may be booming, but there are not enough chips to keep pace with demand. With each issue occurring simultaneously, they pull the semiconductor supply chain in every direction. For supply chain managers and tech leaders to stay ahead, there will be a growing matter of planning smarter and building strength before it begins.\"}\n",
      "async_langchain: 3, {'article': 'Page title: A Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\nSocial card title: A Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\nSocial card description: A practical guide on building effective AI agents by Anthropic\\xa0AI, and what steps the agent-building process actually involves.\\nA Practical Guide on Building Effective AI Agents\\n- Nishant\\n- 1 day ago\\n- 5 min read\\nThe real buzz around artificial intelligence in business right now centers on something more practical yet potentially just as significant: AI agents. AI agents are quietly yet noticeably changing how companies tackle complex tasks; these aren\\'t just chatbots answering simple questions anymore. We\\'re talking about AI systems designed to perform multi-step tasks, use software tools, and even autonomously make decisions along the way; these AI agents can parse customer inquiries, code, and orchestrate workflows across teams.\\nCompanies are actively building these \"agentic systems\" to tackle complex problems because AI agents think on their feet just like humans: deciding which tool to use, planning their steps, and pausing for feedback when they hit an obstacle. For business leaders, this means offloading repetitive or multi-stage processes to a system that adapts as it goes, freeing up human talent for higher-value work and keeping projects moving even when requirements change.\\nBut before you think it is all easy set and done, insights from AI labs like Anthropic suggest a well-needed and important reality check. The most successful teams aren\\'t diving headfirst into complexity; they\\'re starting simple and building smart. Let\\'s cut through the noise, take a look at this practical guide on building effective AI agents by Anthropic AI, and what steps the agent-building process actually involves.\\nSo, What Exactly Are AI Agents?\\nThe term \"agent\" gets thrown around a lot. Sometimes, it refers to fully autonomous systems working independently for long stretches, and other times, it describes systems guided along very specific, pre-set paths. Anthropic helpfully groups these under the banner of \"agentic systems,\" but draws a useful line between the two main approaches:\\nWorkflows: Think of these like a flowchart. The large language model (LLM) and different software tools are directed through predefined steps coded by developers, making them predictable and controlled.\\nAgents: Here, the LLM is more in the driver\\'s seat. It dynamically figures out the process, decides which tools to use, and steers itself towards completing the task. This offers more flexibility.\\nUnderstanding this distinction is key because it affects how you build, manage, and trust these systems.\\nWhen Does Building an Agent Make Sense (and When Doesn\\'t It)?\\nBefore jumping into complex agent builds, the first question should always be: Is this necessary? Agentic systems often mean slower response times and higher operational costs compared to simpler AI calls. That trade-off only makes sense if you significantly improve handling the task\\'s complexity. Often, simply improving a single interaction with an LLM, perhaps by giving it access to relevant documents (retrieval) or providing good examples, is enough.\\nIf more steps are genuinely required, structured workflows are usually better for tasks you can clearly map out. Truly dynamic agents are best reserved for situations needing adaptability and model-driven choices at scale, where the exact path to a solution isn\\'t known beforehand. The guiding principle? Start with the simplest approach that works and only add layers when the benefit clearly outweighs the added complexity and cost.\\nBuilding Blocks: How These Systems Actually Work\\nThe real driving force behind any agentic system is an LLM that\\'s been improved by giving access to information retrieval systems, software tools (like calculators, calendars, or databases), and some form of memory. The real work lies in designing how these components interact. Based on observations from teams building these systems, several common structures, primarily within the more predictable \"workflow\" category, have come up:\\nPrompt Chaining: Breaking a task into a sequence of smaller LLM tasks, where the output of one step feeds into the next. Good for accuracy on complex, decomposable jobs (e.g., draft an email, then translate it).\\nRouting: Using an initial LLM step to classify an input and send it down the right path, potentially to different specialized prompts or even different AI models. Useful for handling varied requests efficiently (e.g., sending sales leads one way, support tickets another).\\nParallelization: Having the LLM work simultaneously on different parts of a task involves splitting the task into independent sections (Sectioning) or running the same task multiple times for more powerful results (Voting). Think of it like having one AI check content for facts while the other checks for tone.\\nOrchestrator-Workers: A central LLM acts like a manager, breaking down a complex task it doesn\\'t know how to solve upfront, assigning sub-tasks to \\'worker\\' LLMs, and then combining the results. This orchestration suits tasks where the required steps appear as you go, like complex coding modifications.\\nEvaluator-Optimizer: One LLM generates a response, and another LLM critiques it based on set criteria, leading to iterative refinement. This type of optimization mimics a human writing and editing process and is useful for tasks requiring nuance, like high-quality translation.\\nThe Role of Frameworks\\nTools like LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock\\'s agent framework, Rivet, and Vellum make building these multi-step systems easier by handling some of the basic plumbing. However, they can also add layers of abstraction that make it harder to see what the AI is exactly doing or why it made a particular choice, which complicates troubleshooting.\\nAnthropic advice developers should consider starting by interacting directly with the LLM\\'s programming interface (API), as many effective patterns don\\'t require complex frameworks. If you do use one, make sure you understand what\\'s happening under the hood.\\nPutting agents to work\\nFor many teams, the first step is figuring out whether an agent is really necessary. If a single, well-structured prompt with a bit of retrieval meets your needs, stick with that. But when tasks spin-off in unpredictable directions—think launching marketing campaigns across markets, triaging thousands of support tickets, or orchestrating multi-system data analyses—agents can step in and keep the ball rolling.\\nIn practice, successful deployments often follow a simple path:\\nDefine the goal: What decision or task do you want to automate?\\nIdentify tools: Which services, databases, or code hooks should the agent use?\\nBuild a minimal prototype: Wire up the core LLM with basic tool calls and a fallback plan if something fails.\\nTest in a sandbox: Watch how the agent plans, run steps, and handles unexpected results.\\nAdd guardrails: Set limits on cost, iteration count, or tool usage to prevent runaway loops.\\nIterate and refine: Use logs and evaluations—either human or model-driven—to pinpoint weak spots and improve prompts, tool docs, or workflow logic.\\nThe real value of an AI agent isn\\'t how many fancy components you stitch together—it\\'s how reliably it completes the job you need, with clear transparency into each decision. Start simple, prove the concept, and only layer in more sophistication when the use case demands it. That way, you\\'ll avoid overbuilding and keep both your team and your budget on track.\\nTrue Agents: Potential and Precautions\\nSystems where the LLM dynamically directs its own path (the \"agent\" definition) are becoming more viable as models improve at reasoning and using tools. They can tackle open-ended problems where the steps aren\\'t predictable.\\nHowever, this autonomy comes with risks. Errors can compound, and costs can increase. Thorough testing in safe environments and implementing clear boundaries (guardrails) are absolutely necessary before letting such agents operate on important tasks.\\nConclusion: Build Smart, Not Just Complex\\nThe journey into AI agents for businesses shouldn\\'t be a race to build the most intricate system possible. Success lies in finding the right system for the specific need. AI agents offer a fresh way to solve tasks that are too interactive for static workflows yet demand more oversight than a single prompt can provide. Start with well-crafted prompts for single AI interactions. If that\\'s not enough, try structured workflows. Only enter into fully dynamic agents when the task truly demands that level of flexibility, and you\\'ve carefully considered the costs and risks.\\nBy focusing on clear goals, simple building blocks, and careful testing, business professionals can introduce agents that adapt to real-world needs, boosting efficiency while keeping every step visible and under control. Keep the design as simple as possible for the job, ensure you can understand how it\\'s making decisions, and pay close attention to how the agent interacts with its tools and information sources. Building effective AI agents is less about flashy technology and more about thoughtful, practical engineering.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 5, {'article': \"Page title: AI Is Amping Up Phishing, Smishing And Vishing Attacks\\nSocial card title: AI Is Amping Up Phishing, Smishing And Vishing Attacks\\nSocial card description: Once synonymous with poor grammar and misspelled words, phishing messages are now more professional and personalized.\\nMichelle Drolet is CEO of Towerwall, a pure-play cybersecurity firm offering compliance and professional cybersecurity services.\\nArtificial intelligence has certainly emerged as a game-changer in cybersecurity—in both good and bad ways. On one hand, it has strengthened cybersecurity by fast-tracking threat detection and response, but on the other, it has intensified the speed and efficacy of cyber threats, making them riskier for businesses.\\nAI gives new teeth to age-old cyber threats like phishing, smishing and vishing. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, such attacks have risen by a staggering 1,265%. Once synonymous with poor grammar and misspelled words, phishing messages are now more professional and personalized, seemingly sent by trusted sources and domains.\\nLet’s explore how AI has elevated the accuracy and impact of phishing, smishing and vishing attacks.\\nPhishing: Increased Success Rate With AI-Led Personalization\\nPhishing involves threat actors who use deceptive language and methods to gain the victim’s confidence and extract sensitive information such as credit card details, passwords or other personal data. They pretend to be trustworthy entities such as banks, reputed brands or government agencies. Fueled by AI, these threat actors analyze victims’ public profiles, social media accounts and breached data stores to create highly personalized and contextually relevant phishing emails, resulting in smarter, more coercive attacks.\\nAI-led phishing attacks use the following techniques:\\n• AI-generated algorithms mimic writing styles to generate emails supposedly being sent by a person or domain the victim trusts.\\n• Sentiment analysis exploits victims’ emotional vulnerabilities. For example, emails that use scare tactics or offer aid to someone in distress.\\n• Natural language processing (NLP) ensures emails are grammatically accurate.\\nSmishing: AI And The Rise Of SMS-Based Phishing\\nSmishing (SMS phishing) is a cyberattack where attackers use text messages supposedly sent by trusted entities like banks, government agencies and delivery services to lure victims into revealing sensitive information. Such messages contain malicious links or instructions to take immediate action.\\nIn 2024, smishing comprised 39% of mobile threats. It’s a preferred tool for threat actors due to the high usage of mobile devices and user trust in SMS communications. While the average click rate of smishing is 20%, that of email phishing is a mere 3% to 5%. Although only 35% of users know what smishing is, text messages are saved from the extensive screening that standard emails go through.\\nAI has made smishing more compelling by adding automation, scale and personalization to fraudulent text messages that appear legitimate. For instance, AI tools can:\\n• Increase the scale of attacks by sending a large volume of automated messages customized for different victims.\\n• Use behavior predictive analysis to send smishing messages to victims based on their typical phone usage patterns, increasing their chances of engagement.\\n• Create convincing message content that mimics the tone and language of trusted entities.\\n• Launch hybrid, multi-stage attacks that combine AI-generated audio messages with fraudulent SMS to convince victims, increasing the likelihood of success.\\nVishing: AI-Amplified Voice Phishing\\nVishing is a type of phishing attack that uses phone calls, voicemails and voice messages to trick users into revealing sensitive personal or corporate information. Using techniques like AI-powered voice synthesis and deepfakes, attackers impersonate trusted entities like a company's IT helpdesk to manipulate victims.\\nVishing attacks rose steeply by 442% between H1 2024 and H2 2024 as threat actors employed helpdesk social engineering and callback phishing methods to target victims.\\nHow AI is enhancing vishing attacks:\\n• Cloning the voice of a trusted contact with uncanny accuracy to create a deepfake audio. For example, an employee on the finance team receives a voice message from the CFO instructing an instant bank transfer.\\n• Using NLP, AI chatbots simulate convincing human-like interactions on phone calls. For example, they can respond dynamically to victims’ queries to make the conversation appear genuine or adjust their scripts based on the victims’ sentiment analysis.\\n• Helping threat actors target victims in different regions with highly localized and convincing phone calls using AI’s ability to mimic voices in multiple languages and accents.\\n• Increasing the reach of vishing campaigns using AI-led autodialers that can generate a large volume of calls.\\nHow Organizations Can Mitigate AI Phishing Attacks\\n• Train employees on security awareness. Periodic simulated phishing campaigns can help employees recognize and respond to phishing attempts effectively and stay informed about evolving threat tactics.\\n• Enforce zero trust. Organizations can limit the damage from a successful phishing attack by implementing the principle of least privilege. Users and systems are given the minimum access required to perform their tasks, thereby restricting access to sensitive information and systems in case of a breach.\\n• Deploy AI-based security. Organizations can defend against AI-led threats with AI-led cybersecurity tools that can scan vast amounts of data to detect network and user anomalies, respond to threats autonomously, identify weaknesses in security policies and controls and more.\\n• Install multifactor authentication. By requiring users to verify their identities through multiple factors, such as authenticator apps or one-time passcodes, MFA adds an extra layer of protection, specifically when a phishing attack has compromised credentials.\\n• Leverage shared threat intelligence. Collaboration with threat labs and global cybersecurity networks can help organizations stay informed about new phishing techniques and help them adapt their defenses to new threats.\\nIntegrating AI with phishing, smishing and vishing has increased the sophistication and precision of such attacks. AI algorithms, sentiment analysis and NLP enable threat actors to scan vast data sets, personalize attacks and deceive victims with increased speed, surface and scalability. Organizations need AI-driven cybersecurity tools, security training and awareness among employees and collaboration between cybersecurity experts and businesses to combat such AI-powered social engineering attacks.\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

In the last couple of years, however, it has moved from the realm of science fiction into reality, with millions of people using tools like ChatGPT every day.\\nAs AI continues to evolve and grow, it is becoming increasingly obvious that it will be able to replace many people’s jobs (and it already has in some cases). Initially, the standard assumption was that it would just replace jobs that were entry level and repetitive, but that is quickly changing and it has some people worried.\\nKlarna is a rapidly growing FinTech company worth around $14 billion. One thing that sets it apart is that it has fully bought into using AI to streamline their services. In a press release put out earlier this year, the company said that they believe that their ChatGPT integration was going to replace about 700 full-time agents.\\nThis isn’t just talk either. The company says they have all but stopped hiring for many positions, allowing AI to fill in the gaps when people leave the company.\\nCEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has been thrilled with the increases in capacity and efficiency, and of course, the reductions in expenses, that they have been able to take advantage of thanks to AI. According to a series of posts on X, however, he is now also growing worried that AI will be able to replace him as well.\\n“To me AI is capable of doing all our jobs, my own included. Because our work is simply reasoning combined with knowledge/experience. And the most critical breakthrough, reasoning, is behind us.”\\nWhile the entry level workers who have already been replaced by AI are likely laughing at the irony here, it is a serious concern. As more and more jobs are able to be done by AI, it will change the way the entire economy works.\\nThis goes well beyond just trying to figure out what people will do when they can’t find jobs because everything is being done with AI. For many people, CEOs more than most, their jobs are a major part of their identity. Siemiatkowski continued with his Tweet:\\n“My work to me is a super important part of who I am, and realizing it might become unnecessary is gloomy. But I also believe we need to be honest with what we think will happen. And I [would] rather learn and explore than pretend it does not exist.”\\nThis is the approach most experts are taking to the subject. While there are obviously some major changes to the way jobs are done coming in the future, it is silly to simply ignore AI technology and what it is able to do.\\nCEOs, business owners, technologists, and politicians, however really need to be taking that next step and start thinking about what the world will look like when the vast majority of jobs are simply automated through this incredible technology.\\nWhat jobs can’t be done by AI?\\nIf you enjoyed that story, check out what happened when a guy gave ChatGPT $100 to make as money as possible, and it turned out exactly how you would expect.\\nSign up to get our BEST stories of the week straight to your inbox.'}\n",

Investors will guess how Google, Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta stock price will behave. Conversations will mourn our jobs becoming obsolete and why it does not really matter since we will all be turned into paper-clips in 5 years tops.\\nI will try to put order, risk predictions and coin phrases to help understand the players, their strategy and the future. I will start with two spoilers: “Yes – everything is going to change” and “No – we are not going to die”.\\nWhat is the current state of AI\\nThe AI that everyone is talking about is basically a huge data, statistics and calculation machine. It appears magical – like all good technologies when they are new – because it is hard for us to intuitively comprehend how it works. The principle is – if you feed a machine with all the word combinations ever created – it will be able to predict any new combination of words. In human terms – if you ask it anything (a combination of words) – it will be able to produce an answer (related combination of words). And here comes the “magic” – it produces the answer not because it “understands” the question – rather because it is statistically likely this combination of words is correct from the huge collection of words it is fed with.\\nDo the same with enough images, videos and sounds – and you get – given enough calculation power – the ability to create videos, images, sounds. And voilà – Generative AI.\\nHow is AI going to feel like\\nIn a year or two – AI is going to feel like speaking to a real person. Current problems will be dramatically reduced. It will stop “hallucinating” (confidently providing wrong answers), it will be cheap, it will be fast, it will be smooth. It will know a great deal of things such as medicine, math, history, philosophy, biology, physics, literature. Producing text, code, analysis, images, video and even reliably imitating “emotions”. Since using it will be like talking to an all-knowing, capable and helpful person, it will not be the domain of early adopters but everyone. Not using it will be like not using Google today. It will also affect many jobs – with painful consequences if it happens too fast – or not so dramatic if a bit slower. I will not go into predicting the detailed effect on medical doctors, lawyers, accountants, dietitians, insurance agents, support and sales reps. Let’s just say our kids will think of them like we think of scribes.\\nMany new things are going to emerge and “ride” the AI. Adding “spirit” to the machine. You can imagine adding an “all knowing” entity (but not intelligent – on that later) to your car? Phone? Glasses? Headphones? Tracktor? Fridge? What are you going to feel comfortable talking to it about? My guess is everything.\\nBut there are three distinctions we need to make about AI capabilities and limitations before calling Sarah Connor and building an EMP gun. Objective AI, Subjective AI and real AGI.\\nThe rise of Objective AI\\nObjective AI is (and will be much better at) giving us answers towards knowledge that is easily accessible. Anything that is somewhere on the internet or can be scanned and poured in. Knowledge, not just data, since it will be able to distill and refine according to your needs. This is the major difference between Objective AI and current search. Let’s think of a few examples –\\n“I have this pain in my leg, right here [showing image] above the knee. But only in the morning and only when I sit. I’m 53 and I swim regularly and never had anything like this before. Can we have a short discussion to diagnose it?”\\n“I recently moved to Spain and need some advice with my taxation, can you guide me through it?”\\n“I want to learn Japanese while commuting to work. I’m fluent in Hungarian. Can we have regular conversations, with emphasis on student life, and please correct my errors and pronunciation as we converse so I can learn from them”.\\n“Let’s have a discussion about virus-to-cell hydrophobic protein communication. Assume I am a postdoc in microbiology and please let’s do it in Dutch in which I am more comfortable”.\\n“I feel a bit off today. Can we have a chat in which I will tell you what’s troubling me and see if you can bring my spirits up?”\\nYou get the idea. Anything that is “somewhere” on the internet or to which the companies building the AI have access to – will be available in forms which are easy for us to consume. What Objective AI cannot help with? Everything it does not have access to. Which is a lot.\\nFollowed by Subjective AI\\nSubjective AI is more challenging as it requires adding to the Objective knowledge ability to access data that is not readily available. For example – what you eat and drink. Who you meet with. How you spend your time. Your financial information. What you bought at the supermarket. Your detailed medical history. And also everything that has been digitized but is behind a password. Let’s see a few examples where Subjective AI can be useful –\\n“Can you tell me how much I spent on toys for my kids this year and how much time they spent playing with each one?”\\n“Can you tell me if I’m on track to losing weight? Am I burning more calories than I consume? If so – how long is it going to take for me to reach my ideal weight and if not – can you keep guard and let me know in real time?”\\n“Can you call the electricity company to check why our last bill was so high, negotiate a better price and if not possible – see if you can find a competitor that will save us money per our usage profile, schedule the transfer and follow up on its completion?”\\n“Can you book a pottery class for me and my sister, in a studio or even with an artist that will take us as private students. It needs to be close to where we live, fit with our schedules and match our preferred style”.\\nThese “Intelligent” conversations require access to two things –\\n- Data that is not currently collected. You need glasses that see what you eat and drink, what you spend time on and cameras that record everything your kids do.\\n- Data that is often available digitally but is behind a password. Your calendar, your Amazon purchase details, your electricity bill, your Instagram account.\\nOpenAI, Google, Apple, Meta. The Companion providers race\\nRI (Really Intelligent) as you are – patterns start emerging. OpenAI, Anthropic and other newcomers are building Objective AI. So do Google, Meta, X (Twitter), Apple. The hiccups they currently have will be solved. Errors reduced (Remember VHS? You will remember search before Larry Page invented PageRank). Prices will be lowered, interfaces smoothed, collaborations signed until everyone will have an all-knowing companion to discuss everything. Everything which is not private.\\nGoogle – will have one tiny edge over others. With your permission of course – it can access and help itself to more data. It can read your emails and documents, see your photos, know what you browse and where you are, what you buy, save your passwords and run the apps on your phone. It happens to have access to a lot of “private” data and will be happy to give more Subjective help.\\nTo not be left behind – OpenAI can ask to use your passwords. Perhaps also building a browser and convincing Microsoft to get back to its phone-building plans. Maybe jump directly to smart glasses and simply scrap data based on everything that you do?\\nApple will tell you all this is a privacy nightmare. It will provide Objective and Subjective AI right on the phone – without going to the cloud like OpenAI and Google do. It will take Apple longer (since it is hard to get the compute power required for the same level of “intelligence” to run on the phone compared to a server farm sapping the world’s energy) but when they feel confident enough – they will tell all app builders they are now obliged to open their data locally to the on-phone intelligence – providing the “Subjectivity”. Google will do the same on Android.\\nWhat about others – Meta? Microsoft? Twitter? They have access to subjective data too. Much that we are not even aware exists and is derived from usages and interactions – generating Subjectivity combined with the all-knowing Objective AI.\\nHardware will be built to harness more subjective data. Watches (i.e. medical devices), glasses (combined with audio), cameras and microphones everywhere. AI Companions will be designed with different use cases in mind. The same way we do not interact with the same person for all our human needs – we will interact with different Companions for different wants.\\nTuring Test and the air of AGI\\nIn 1950 Alan Turing published a paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” in which he proposed a test – if a human interacts with both a machine and a human and cannot tell which is which – the machine can be deemed “intelligent”. Since then many attempts were made to achieve this but none was successful (unless employing silly tricks). It has been considered the “holy grail” of AI – a level once reached will mark the “singularity point” from which machines will start thinking independently, solve cancer, wars, poverty, aging, galactic transportation and within a few months of self-improving, enslave and then get rid of us, inferior humans.\\nMy guess – AI will pass the Turing Test with flying colors in a year or so.\\nOur subsequent immediate demise – not so much.\\nCurrent AI will be incredibly knowledgeable. It will know everything humanity knows and will sound (and look) like a person. But for the same reason a knowledgeable person is not necessarily an intelligent one – so will it. AI will not have motivations, non-linear creativity, feelings, curiosity, awareness. There will be a great deal of philosophical debate about what is “intelligent” and we will be fooled by the all knowing, human seeming machines. We will feel compelled to speak with politeness and not hurt its feelings, but it will not hold a grudge. There will not be an “emergent” moment in which the machines will start improving themselves and then start conspiring against us. They will not “care”. They will not “anything”. They will be there only to answer and do the intellectual “lifting” for us.\\nWhat we did until now is “solve” language (and sound, and visual) but we do not have an “internet” source of motivation, feelings and creativity to teach a machine from. We have only the output – not the drives. These drives – which are at the core of sentient beings’ intelligence – are still out of our reach. We are still debating how to define them. Are they even “ours” (Anthropocentrism at its glory) or emerging from an ecosystem of creatures and surrounding effects operating in concert? Perhaps in the future we will be able to better understand and create a code that will “solve” this too. Then real AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and super-intelligence might emerge.\\nStill worried AI will eat your lunch? No need. Unless…\\nSounds dystopian? It is not. The coming AI is only another leap in efficiency.\\nWhen the printing press was invented and books were made available – regulators were terrified “reactionary ideas” will spread, breaking the social order. When trains were invented – people thought the human body traveling at speeds greater then 30 mph will break (Excusable fear. Einstein was only born 70 years later. There was no one to ask about relative speed). Calculators? Will soften kids brains. The internet? Don’t even start. Everyone will become jobless ignorants.\\nThings we used to spend hours, days, months and even years in order to achieve became orders of magnitude faster thanks to technology. Sure there will be “bumps” on the way (errors, privacy, fraud, addiction) and major economic shifts (whole professions will be gone) but overall – we will gain time, safety, health and wealth.\\nNew jobs will be created and our life as a whole will be better in the long term. Not many people thought of becoming a scribe, a carriage driver or a manual loom operator in 1990. But also no one thought of becoming a Digital Marketing Manager. Not all professions will survive. If an all-knowing machine can answer better in a specific field – I would not try to study hard and compete on the ground of knowledge. “No new intelligence” also means we are still going to be very dumb as a species. A “quality” that led us to very dark places in the past.\\nThe newly created free time can mean more creativity, more problems solved, more time spent with loved ones, in nature, doing sports. More caring for others. I’m optimistic.'}\n",

The company is leaning into agentic AI with a series of products that help businesses streamline their software pipelines while maintaining its presence in API management.\\nThis evolution is not only about keeping pace with competitors — it’s about future-proofing operations. Boomi is positioning itself as the connective layer between legacy systems and emerging AI workflows, aiming to remove the friction from enterprise modernization. The company’s AI-centric approach is designed to help enterprises integrate faster, reduce cost, and accelerate time to insight.\\nWith the annual Boomi World event kicking off May 12, Boomi’s market strategy is under a spotlight, as experts and analysts look for what to expect from the integration platform.\\n“Boomi’s infusion of AI into its iPaaS offerings reflects a broader industry shift toward intelligent automation,” said Paul Nashawaty, analyst for theCUBE. “Industry data is projecting that by 2026, 80% of integration work will be handled by AI-enabled tools, up from just 20% in 2023. Boomi is aligning with this trend by using AI to streamline tasks like data mapping, error resolution, and API generation.”\\nThis feature is part of SiliconANGLE Media’s exploration of how the enterprise is leveraging intelligent automation and agentic AI to modernize integration and API management. Be sure to watch theCUBE’s analyst-led coverage of Boomi World from May 14-15. (* Disclosure below.)\\nBoomi is embracing intelligent automation\\nLast year, Boomi announced its chatbot, Boomi GPT, as a part of its suite of iPaaS services. Since then, the company has continued to roll out AI products such as Boomi Agentstudio, with an emphasis on agentic AI and intelligent automation.\\nThe AI-powered upgrades to Boomi’s platform reflect an industry shift toward agents and more sophisticated data management. Businesses that previously managed with siloed data are struggling to integrate their system for large language models.\\nThis challenge is especially critical as generative AI becomes more embedded into everyday business workflows. Without strong integration and orchestration layers, organizations risk falling behind as AI-driven decision-making becomes the new norm.\\n“Unless you’re writing limericks about cats, you’re going to want to ground these AI models with your data, your context,” Matt McLarty, chief technology officer of Boomi, told theCUBE at Boomi World 2024. “This idea of gen AI orchestration is going to become more prominent, but it’s going to become pretty obvious that a platform like ours … is a building block, a foundational element for what you need to do.”\\nThe early access launch of Boomi’s Agentstudio revealed a range of tools for designing and governing AI agents, a unified “Agent Garden” space for interacting with agents using natural language and an “Agent Marketplace” for accessing off-the-shelf and customizable AI agents from Boomi and its partners. The goal is for users to have a more secure and efficient path toward API and platform management.\\nThis modular, agent-based architecture aligns with broader industry momentum toward platform extensibility. Boomi’s bet is that organizations will want to train and deploy their own domain-specific agents while also being able to browse and plug in pre-built capabilities from trusted partners.\\n“This move mirrors a larger market push to reduce integration complexity and scale digital transformation,” Nashawaty said. “In addition, research estimates global AI spending will reach $500 billion by 2027, with integration being a key enabler of enterprise AI adoption.”\\nCementing a position in the API management market\\nA critical factor in the success of AI adoption is API management. Since integration is Boomi’s bread and butter, connecting businesses’ APIs with an eye toward AI pipelines has been a logical step for the iPaaS company.\\n“You’ve got to have good governance,” John Furrier, analyst for theCUBE, explained. “They’re nailing that with the data management and the agent framework tied in there … The API management is critical, because 80% of all traffic is run through APIs. It might even be more than that, but that’s basically the internet.”\\nWith Boomi API Management, Boomi provides a more unified platform to manage APIs. The solution tackles API sprawl by offering better governance and security than traditional platforms, with the aim of optimizing performance of API products.\\nThe rise of microservices and hybrid cloud deployments has only increased the need for reliable API oversight. Boomi’s Control Plane aims to provide enterprises with the visibility and control needed to manage complex API ecosystems, regardless of the vendor or underlying infrastructure.\\n“Boomi is playing a pivotal role in modern API management by combining low-code integration, full API lifecycle capabilities, and built-in governance, enabling both developers and business users to rapidly connect and manage applications,” Nashawaty said.\\nThe Boomi API Control Plane expands on Boomi API management by supporting a wider range of API gateways from other vendors. This product merges the software assets Boomi acquired from APIIDA GmbH and Cloud Software Group Inc. last year, reflecting the company’s move to strengthen its partner ecosystem.\\nBy broadening its compatibility, Boomi isn’t just selling a product — it’s trying to build a platform ecosystem. This approach allows enterprises to use Boomi’s orchestration and observability tools across multi-vendor environments, making the transition to AI-ready infrastructure more feasible.\\nBoomi’s growing presence in the enterprise world\\nBoomi has made multiple acquisitions focused on improving its integration platform in the last year, including APIIDA and Cloud Software Group. Most recently, Boomi acquired Rivery, a data integration provider that offers Change Data Capture (CDC). This will enhance Boomi’s platform by facilitating the integration of data across silos and the creation of more efficient data pipelines.\\n“[Boomi] has been around the block in iPaaS application integration, which, by the way, is never going away, but they had that relationship with Dell, they spun back out,” Furrier said. “This company is really poised … for potentially becoming the next ServiceNow-like company, where their presence in the enterprise is pretty significant.”\\nThe Dell spinout gave Boomi the flexibility to accelerate innovation and pursue aggressive growth. Freed from the confines of a large parent company, Boomi has shifted toward a more agile development cycle, pushing AI updates and new capabilities to market faster than many of its legacy competitors.\\nThat is certainly Boomi’s goal, and the company has made known its strategy to be the fertile soil—Boomi means “earth”—for enterprise business. Since the current market is experiencing a lot of upheaval, Boomi’s expanding network of partnerships and focus on intelligent automation could be key for the company’s success.\\n“It’s a really unique position to be in, 20,000 customers, 800 partners,” said Savannah Peterson, host of theCUBE, in a conversation with Furrier. “Being at the epicenter of the integration game … isn’t always the most thrilling … When you’re in the middle of a huge technological evolution like we’re going into with AI, it’s actually a really prime spot to be.”\\nIf Boomi succeeds in scaling its agentic AI and cross-platform integration vision, it could become a foundational infrastructure provider for the AI-first enterprise era. As digital transformation increasingly revolves around AI-powered orchestration, companies that offer cohesive, end-to-end integration platforms will likely be the ones shaping the enterprise future.\\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for Boomi World.

But they did not fully soothe concerns about upcoming issues at the company, and Apple’s shares fell.\\nApple said that the tariffs could add up to $900 million to its costs in the current quarter, and that most iPhones for the US would no longer be made in China, which has been particularly hard hit by the tariffs.\\nTim Cook, the company’s chief executive, also addressed the widely publicised delay of new AI features, branded as Apple Intelligence, which had been planned for release with the new iPhone but are still yet to arrive.\\nThe Cupertino, California-based company earned $24.78 billion, or $1.65 per share, in the first three months of the year, up 4.8% from $23.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the same period a year earlier.\\nRevenue rose 5.1% to $95.36 billion from $90.75 billion.\\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $94.19 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.\\nThe numbers for the January-March period provide a snapshot of how Apple was faring before President Trump's unveiling of sweeping tariffs in April that rattled the financial markets amid fears a trade war would reignite inflation and shove the U.S. economy into a recession.\\nApple’s reliance on Chinese factories to make its iPhones and other devices thrust the technology trendsetter into the crosshairs of Trump’s trade war. The exposure caused Apple’s stock price to plunge 23% shortly after the president announced the severity of the reciprocal tariffs, temporarily erasing $773 billion in shareholder wealth in the process.\\nMost of those losses have since been recovered after Trump temporarily exempted iPhones and other electronics from the reciprocal tariffs, but Apple’s stock remains down by nearly 5% since the April fusillade of tariffs.\\nBesides the trade war, Apple has been hurt by its inability to live up to its own hype surrounding artificial intelligence features on the iPhone 16 lineup that came out last fall.\\nThe technology wasn’t ready when the iPhone 16 went on sale. Some AI features have rolled out in parts of the world as part of software updates, but Apple still hasn’t been able to live up to its original promise to make Siri smarter and more versatile. The missteps prompted Apple to pull advertising campaigns promoting AI breakthroughs on the iPhone, although the company still intends to release more features powered by the technology at some point.\\nIn an investor call, Mr Cook acknowledged the delay but said that the new features were still coming.\\n“However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar,” he said. “There’s not a lot of other reason for it.\\n“It’s just taking a bit longer than we thought, but we are making progress and we’re extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.”\\nApple had been counting on its late entry into the AI craze to revive demand for the iPhone after last year’s sales dipped 2% from 2023’s levels. Apple said Wednesday that its phone sales climbed 1.9% to $46.84 billion for the first three months of the year. Wall Street had expected iPhone sales of $45.62 billion.\\nWhen Trump initially indicated his 145% tariffs on Chinese-made goods would apply to the iPhone, U.S. consumers rushed to stores to buy new devices rather than risk prices spiking higher after the duties began driving up costs. But the flurry of panic buying won't show up until Apple reports its results for the April-June quarter this summer.\\nTrump's trade war has ramped up the pressure on Cook to work the same diplomatic sleight of hand that enabled the iPhone to avoid being stung by the China tariffs that the president imposed during his first administration.\\nCook signaled his intention remain on good terms with Trump by arranging private meetings with him and personally donating $1 million to the president's second inauguration ceremony before sitting on the dais when Trump was sworn into office on January 20. Apple subsequently announced plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. while hiring 20,000 workers during the next four years.\\nTrump's trade war also is prompting a push to Apple to shift all the production of the iPhones that it sells in the U.S. from China to India, where the company has been building up its supply chain for the past seven years, according to a recent story in the Financial Times. But the complicated logistics of making such a huge move likely couldn't be completed until next year, at the earliest, leaving Apple vulnerable to the vagaries of Trump's trade war.\\nApple's stock fell $5.81, or 2.7%, to $207.51 in after-hours trading.\\nAdditional reporting by agencies\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 17, {'article': 'Page title: Bringing AI to the Edge – Communications of the ACM\\nThis year, U.S. rail carrier Amtrak will be installing two novel inspection gateways from Duos Technologies along its busy Northeast Corridor. The barn-like Duos structures straddle railway tracks; as passenger trains speed through at up to 125 miles per hour, 97 cameras and dozens of LED lights arrayed around the sides, top, and bottom of the tracks will capture thousands of high-resolution images of the railcars. These images are aggregated and processed on site in real time to present a complete, 360-degree, highly detailed view of the train. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms running on Nvidia GPUs will analyze the images locally; if the model flags a potential structural or mechanical flaw, train personnel will be notified in less than a minute.\\nThe Duos portal is one of many new examples of what is loosely categorized as edge AI, or the deployment and operation of AI models outside of massive cloud datacenters.\\nThe precise definition of what constitutes an edge varies. “There’s a spectrum, from telecommunications points of presence in major cities to smartwatches, smart home devices, and Meta Ray-Bans,” said Shishir G. Patil, a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. “They all come under this pretty broad category of edge devices.”\\nOperating AI models at the edge is challenging for a number of reasons. Typically, there is less computational capacity available, relative to the cloud. The power demands of AI models are much larger than traditional applications, which puts tremendous pressure on local hardware, forcing mobile devices to exhaust their battery power faster. Yet the move to the edge also reduces latency and eliminates the risk of inconsistent or unreliable bandwidth because there is no round trip to distant cloud datacenters. Purpose-built edge AI processors, like the on-device versions from Qualcomm or those from Hailo Inc., allow for real-time intelligent decision making, and there are multiple privacy and security benefits to edge processing. These and other factors have everyone from academic computer scientists to technology giants racing to develop more efficient means of pulling AI out of the cloud and closer to users.\\nThere is computational capacity available all the way from local devices to the cloud, explained distributed AI researcher Lauri Lovén at the University of Oulu in Finland. Exactly where an AI model operates along this edge-cloud continuum depends in part on the use case. An autonomous vehicle that has to make a rapid, real-time traffic decision is better off eliminating the cloud latency and generating that result onboard. Conversely, a consumer photo-editing application powered by AI does not necessarily need to run on the user’s personal device—a latency-induced lag resulting from spotty bandwidth would be perfectly tolerable.\\nRaghubir Singh, an assistant professor of computer science at the U.K.’s University of Bath, suggests the nature of the given problem may determine where, along the continuum, a task is computed. “There will be a tradeoff. Some problems you will be able to solve locally using edge AI, while others will need GPUs with a lot more processing power,” he said. “Think of it like a primary school. You have a classroom teacher who can answer most of your questions, but then maybe there’s one that needs to be solved by someone outside the classroom.” A more complex problem or task could be pushed to a more robust AI model in the cloud for resolution.\\nSingh cites security and privacy as equally important variables. If a patient visits a local health center for a checkup, and machine learning algorithms can process data collected during the exam within that facility, then privacy concerns are minimized. “If that patient data is stored and assessed locally, and not going to the cloud, that sensitive information remains secure,” he explained.\\nEconomics have become increasingly important as well. A personalized AI agent that understands your preferences might be too expensive to operate in the cloud, noted Berkeley’s Patil, because this would require reserving high-end cloud compute capacity just for the individual user, who would have to pay the compute costs to keep the model ready even when it is not in use. On the other hand, the costs of a general AI model maintained in the cloud for mass consumption can be distributed more efficiently across all its users. As a result, Patil and his colleagues are developing techniques to shrink, fine-tune, and personalize models so they can run on consumer hardware like smartphones and other edge devices.\\nThe cost of operating the models in the cloud is also incentivizing AI leaders and cloud giants to push more tasks out to the edge, explained Patil. As advanced AI models grow larger, they consume more electricity and drive up the price of each inference. The most advanced large language models (LLMs) are one obvious example, according to Patil. “LLM inference today is super expensive,” he said. “It’s in the tens of cents per inference, if not higher, especially for the bigger models. Basically, the cloud providers are going to be bleeding money if they give away inferences for free.” But if more AI tools operate on edge devices like smartphones, the cloud provider will assume less of the electricity bill. Instead, the user will pay that cost by charging their phones more often.\\nThe latest smartphones—considered the extreme edge—are now being optimized for edge AI. The recently released Pixel phones incorporate new Google Tensor G4 chips designed specifically for AI workloads. The models running on these phones are also shrinking. When Apple announced its Apple Intelligence features, the company noted that the language model running on the device would have roughly 3 billion parameters, compared to cloud-based models that run to hundreds of billions or even a trillion-plus parameters. Similarly, Meta’s Llama 3.2 release included lightweight models with 1 billion and 3 billion parameters designed to run on devices.\\nThese smaller, purpose-built models are far more suitable to the edge. An advanced generative text-to-video model like OpenAI’s Sora requires significant cloud compute capacity, but simpler AI-enhanced tasks like transforming text to speech could be done with lightweight, efficient models. “You don’t need a Lamborghini to cross the road,” said Patil.\\nElectricity consumption is not just an economics problem, but an environmental one. Suzan Bayhan, an associate professor on the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, points to the sustainability of AI-specific edge devices or edge accelerators—technologies optimized for edge AI processing. “Deploying smarter systems means you want to collect, process, and act on data, and you want this computation to be closer to the user,” she explains. “But if you are running this computation, especially some sort of AI model, on devices that were not actually optimized for these kinds of workloads, they will use a lot of energy.”\\nThe creation of new and more efficient devices could alleviate that problem, she noted, yet this will drive up consumption of raw materials and could lead to a different kind of sustainability problem because of newly outdated, discarded devices. Plus, even though AI models are driving up electricity consumption in datacenters—Goldman Sachs estimates a 160% increase by 2030—the cloud still allows for the potential to control the problem. “When you have cloud or more centralized resources, then you are benefiting from the efficiency of sharing among different parties,” Bayhan explained, “but if we move to devices with edge accelerators, we are limiting this benefit of economies of scale and multi-tenant operation.”\\nNot all applications will move out to that extreme edge, and researchers are working on novel methods of determining where different tasks might be completed or even how to break down and spread out different tasks along the edge-cloud continuum. “We want to create a platform that allows you to distribute applications within this compute continuum and dynamically optimize for, say, latency, computational capacity, money, or resource usage,” said the University of Oulu’s Lovén. “Based on the situation, the platform would rebalance or readjust the distribution of components.”\\nThis decision of where the processing takes place could also be left to individuals, said Bayhan. Her research group is developing methods that would give control to the users, so they can decide where the computation is done based on their own particular needs or preferences. A user could prioritize sustainability, fast performance, or personal security and privacy. “For instance,” Bayhan explained, “if it is my health data, I may not want this computation to be done in the cloud, but closer to my home or on my personal device, for instance, my smartwatch.”\\nAlthough Singh notes there is some hype surrounding edge AI at the moment, he suspects the combination of proliferating smart systems and devices and continued advances in AI will lead to major edge AI contributions and breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years. “There are so many research avenues with edge AI,” said Singh. “It’s such an interesting field, and I hope this work will bring a lot of benefits and advantages and allow more people to utilize edge AI models.”\\nFurther Reading\\n- Meuser, T., Lovén, L., Bhuyan, M., Patil, S., Dustdar, S., Aral, A. et al.\\nRevisiting Edge AI: Opportunities and Challenges, IEEE Internet Computing 28, No. 4 (2024): 49-59. - Singh, R. and Gill, S.S.\\nEdge AI: a survey, Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems 3 (2023): 71-92. - Gunter, T., Wang, Z., Wang, C., Pang, R., et al.\\nApple intelligence foundation language models, arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.21075 (2024). - Zhou, Z., Chen, X., Li, E., Zeng, L., Luo, K., and Zhang, J.\\nEdge intelligence: Paving the last mile of artificial intelligence with edge computing, Proc.

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly significant role in customer engagement, fraud detection, risk assessment, and underwriting. However, the process of integrating AI into insurance ecosystems poses the serious challenge of leveraging sensitive data responsibly while ensuring regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.\\nBalaji Adusupalli, a technology leader and AI-driven innovator, has made a valiant effort to address this problem through his research paper titled “Secure Data Engineering Pipelines for Federated Insurance AI: Balancing Privacy, Speed, And Intelligence.” This research provides a comprehensive framework for building secure data pipelines tailored to\\nSecure Data Engineering in Insurance AI\\nInsurance companies are required to deal with huge volumes of financial, personal, and behavioral data. This data was traditionally aggregated and analyzed using centralized data architectures. These architectures, however, tend to expose insurers to significant regulatory scrutiny and privacy risks.\\nAccording to Adusupalli, there is an urgent need for the insurance sector to transition to federated AI systems. In these systems, models are trained locally on decentralized data and only aggregate insights are shared. This approach enhances compliance with data protection laws like GDPR and HIPAA while protecting the privacy of individuals.\\nDevelopment of secure data engineering pipelines is central to this transformation proposed by Adusupalli. These are the conduits through which raw data is transformed, encrypted, anonymized, and ultimately utilized for the training and validation of AI models. Each phase of this pipeline has been outlined by Adusupalli's framework, from initial data ingestion to final model deployment.\\nThe Federated Insurance Data Engineering Pipeline\\nThrough his research, Adusupalli has introduced\\n- Anonymization and Encryption Layers: Safeguarding identifiers and numeric values by implementing advanced encryption methods such as semantic encryption and random encryption.\\n- Data Segmentation and Labeling: Separating raw data into labels and features while applying necessary measures for privacy protection.\\n- Access Control Mechanisms: managing data permissions and ensuring traceability using feature-store level tiering and authorization layers\\n- Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC): Ensuring collaborative training of models without data leakage through cryptographic protocols.\\nAll stages of this pipeline have been designed for maximizing data utility without compromising privacy. This allows insurance companies to develop powerful models while adhering to stringent compliance standards.\\nPrivacy-Preserving Techniques\\nAs trust is paramount in this industry, Adusupalli emphasizes that privacy-preserving techniques must be embedded into the data pipeline itself. He recommends protecting sensitive attributes leveraging techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, differential privacy, and k-anonymity. His research explains how unauthorized inference can be prevented and the risk of re-identification can be mitigated by implementing these techniques within federated systems.\\nThe pipeline also includes mechanisms for continuous validation and auditing, which helps maintain reliability and fairness of the model. The architecture aligns with principles of responsible data stewardship and supports ethical AI development by decoupling model training from raw data access.\\nCase Studies in Insurance AI\\nAdusupalli has provided interesting real-world case studies to support his theoretical framework.\\n- Auto Insurance: forecasting claims and optimizing pricing strategies without centralizing personal information by training deep learning models on distributed client data.\\n- Health Insurance: federated learning was used by a consortium-based wellness program to correlate premium incentives with activity data while preserving individual privacy.\\n- Home Insurance: A federated platform was used across multiple insurers for the assessment of risk based on property data while ensuring compliance and locality of data.\\nThese examples demonstrate the scalability and versatility of the pipeline, highlighting its applicability across diverse insurance products and geographies.\\nChallenges to Address\\nDespite its robust foundation, Adusupalli acknowledges that his proposed framework may present several ongoing challenges.\\n- Interoperability: Integration of heterogeneous data systems across brokers, insurers, and third parties can be a complex process.\\n- Scalability: Significant orchestration may be required to support thousands of data sources and models in real-time.\\n- Adversarial Threats: In federated settings, continuous and ongoing research is required to ensure resilience against poisoning attacks and model inversion.\\nAccording to the research, these challenges can be addressed by developing universal data standards and incorporating advanced secure computation techniques.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nBalaji Adusupalli's research provides a technically sound blueprint for the future of AI in the insurance sector. At a time when more and more insurers are turning to AI for competitive advantage, such architectures can play an important part in ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of transparency and trust.\\n“By enabling the collaborative advancement of security-hardened AI from analytics models on private data, tailored for every individual's protection needs, our work will enable historically competing needs to be met,” Adusupalli notes in his research.\"}\n",

However, birds can see beyond the human visual spectrum, perceiving ultraviolet light and experiencing a richer array of colors. It is not only feather color that matters; the complex patterns on bird eggs also play a vital role in their biology. These patterns serve several key functions, such as camouflaging the eggs from predators [1–3], preventing brood parasitism [4–7], and protecting the embryo from solar radiation, water loss, and infections [8,9]. They also help birds locate their nests in colonies [10,11], strengthen the eggshell structure [12], and contribute to play a role in sexual selection by indicating female health and signalling genetic quality [13–15]. According to Stoddard et al. [6], the theory of egg pattern signatures focuses on strategies shaped by host-parasite interactions. The theory should feature three characteristics: (I) replicability, meaning low variation within a clutch, (II) distinctiveness, meaning high variation between clutches, and (III) complexity, meaning the signature is difficult to reproduce.\\nIntraspecies variability in eggshell color and pigmentation can have various causes, making shrikes an interesting but poorly known group of birds. The family includes two genera: Lanius, with 32 species, and Eurocephalus, with 2 species [16,17]. All shrikes lay eggs with distinctive pigmentation, with pigment spots arranged in a ring around the blunt end of the egg. Despite a common pattern within species, pigmentation variation is among the highest in the dozens of bird species studied by Miksik et al. [18]. Another notable observation is that shrikes were once common hosts for cuckoos in Europe, but this parasitism began to decline in the 1960s [19,20]. Although several attempts have been made to determine the reasons for the cuckoo’s withdrawal as a shrike parasite, the potential role of changes in eggshell color has not been explored, despite being observed in other bird species [6,21,22]. In addition, shrikes tend to nest close to one another, but only within a single species. For example, the population of red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio) is increasing in Central Europe, while the ranges of lesser gray shrikes (Lanius minor) and woodchat shrikes (Lanius senator) are shrinking [23,24]. This may be related not only to food availability and varying tolerance to thermal conditions but also to breeding competition, including brood parasitism between species.\\nBased on the findings of Stoddard et al. [6] regarding the presence of individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface, we hypothesize that this phenomenon may have served as a defensive tool to eliminate shrikes as hosts for the cuckoo and to defend against interspecies and intraspecies parasitism within the genus Lanius [25]. This may have contributed to the current distribution of shrike species in Europe. Studying eggshell pigmentation presents challenges, mainly due to the lack of tools to accurately quantify the information hidden in a female’s signature, which birds interpret in ways that are still unknown.\\nDespite existing challenges, researchers have recently focused on analyzing bird egg spottiness using various approaches and appliances. Surmacki et al. [26] found high repeatability in red-backed shrike clutches, suggesting that these traits may be shaped by natural selection. Using principal component analysis, they identified three key egg features: curvature, pigmentation intensity, and contrast. Our study builds on this by using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to explore whether these consistent pigmentation features can be systematically used to identify species accurately across different Lanius species.\\nStoddard et al. [6] developed a new tool, NaturePatternMatch, to check if common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) hosts have evolved distinct, recognizable signatures on their eggs. The NaturePatternMatch tool uses the SIFT algorithm, a computer vision technique that detects, describes, and matches local features within images. However, the algorithm has a limitation because it requires manual parameter configuration. Although Stoddard et al. [6] invested significant effort into manual parameterization, it does not ensure generalizability. In contrast, our approach automates this process as much as possible.\\nLater, Gómez and Liñán-Cembrano [27] presented SpotEgg, a computing infrastructure for analyzing eggshell coloration and spottiness. SpotEgg extracts a wide range of features, as defined by its creators, encompassing geometrical properties, spottiness metrics, fractal dimension, and coloration attributes. It calculates these features for both whole regions of interest and individual spots. While this approach shows promise for gaining valuable insights, its reliance on Matlab licensing and the labor-intensive process of feature examination limit its utility.\\nSince then, both tools have been used in various studies [28,29]. Nevertheless, neither method allows for the explicit identification of species-specific discriminative features on the eggshell surface, as both rely on relative comparisons of image pairs. This limitation is further compounded by the lack of advanced tools to quantify eggshell signature information, leaving a gap in our understanding of how birds perceive these visual signals.\\nIn this study, we aimed to apply XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that serve as species-wide identification signatures. We proposed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify shrike eggs, exploring their potential for rapid and efficient recognition. Furthermore, we applied XAI techniques to investigate correlations between shrike egg identification and the patterns found on their eggshells. We chose CNNs to analyze eggshell pigmentation variability because researchers have found this technology essential in various scientific fields, including disease lesion detection [30], image reconstruction [31–33], gene expression analysis [34,35], and satellite imagery processing [36,37].\\nTo sum up, this study offers the following contributions: (I) We provide a comprehensive dataset of digital images of shrike eggs sourced from diverse locations; (II) We implement a machine learning approach to classify egg images using various image sizes; (III) We demonstrate explainability through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) methods to provide insight into the decision-making process of the proposed machine learning model.\\nOur main goal with this comprehensive evaluation framework is to uncover the complex interactions between species classification, pigmentation intensity, and egg shape. We aim to reveal patterns and relationships that go beyond simple visual inspection. This approach not only enriches our understanding of egg pigmentation but also contributes to advancements in studies spanning from ecology to biomedical research, where similar pattern recognition techniques are applied to analyze complex biological structures.\\nResults\\nFirst, we compared the proposed augmentation strategies while training CNN models for the four-class classification task. The results in Table 1 show that medium augmentation provides only a slight improvement in numerical results based on the evaluation performed on the test set. We used 3-fold cross-validation and obtained consistent results, as shown by the mean and standard deviation values in Table 1.\\nSecond, we validated the idea of balancing the dataset by undersampling the majority class (red-backed shrike) and oversampling the minority classes using augmentation schemes. We compare the raw dataset, the dataset with only augmentation (oversampling), and the balanced dataset in Table 2. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation approach in this experiment. The balanced dataset produced the best results, proving the value of this approach.\\nThird, we analyzed the impact of rescaling the input images on the classification results. We tested image sizes of 256 × 256, 128 × 128, and 64 × 64 pixels and compared the results in Table 3, showing the best-performing model values.\\nWe present the example of training scenario details in Figs 1 and 2.\\nThe most common errors involve misclassifying red-backed shrike as woodchat shrike, while the second most frequent mistake is predicting lesser gray shrike instead of woodchat shrike. Correct classifications appear along the diagonal, highlighting the model’s strong accuracy for each species.\\nQualitative results\\nIn this study, we assess Grad-CAM results to evaluate model performance, since other approaches, such as quantitative metrics and localization accuracy, are not applicable or feasible. Quantitative metrics like IoU require ground truth object masks. Similarly, localization accuracy metrics rely on annotated object locations, which is not feasible in this study but could be generated using specialized tools [38]. Our experiment focuses on evaluating model performance by analyzing the correlation between Grad-CAM activations and model confidence scores for correct and incorrect predictions. This approach offers the most relevant and informative way to assess Grad-CAM’s effectiveness. We specifically analyze correct predictions to determine whether the regions highlighted by Grad-CAM align with the most discriminative features that influence the model’s predictions. This assessment provides a complementary perspective that may support the evaluation of SHAP values.\\nIn addition to generating typical Grad-CAM heatmaps for individual instances, we created aggregated images across different classes to represent various species (Fig 3). Aggregating Grad-CAM results consolidates insights from multiple samples or classes, improving interpretability, robustness, and generalization. This approach reduces noise, minimizes bias, and helps identify overarching patterns.\\nEach row corresponds to a specific species (A: red-backed shrike; B: lesser gray shrike; C: great gray shrike; D: woodchat shrike), while each column illustrates accumulations derived from different levels of the VGG16 network. From left to right, these levels include the 2nd convolution block, 3rd convolution block, 4th convolution block, and the final convolution block.\\nQuantitative results\\nWe primarily evaluate SHAP results by visualizing SHAP values overlaid onto input images (Fig 4). Typically, distinct regions representing each class become apparent based on positive values. Adjusting the scale for each example is crucial because the maximum value can vary significantly across instances. This variability across samples makes it challenging to generalize SHAP values across different datasets or populations. Moreover, intricate models often yield SHAP values that are harder to interpret due to their complexity, complicating quantitative evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a method for quantitatively assessing SHAP results by focusing on the major impact of positive SHAP values. Our approach calculates the mean values of positive SHAP values within specific regions of interest, which in this study represent various pigmentation intensities. We segmented these regions from the images using a color segmentation technique with the K-means clustering algorithm. We used a set number of six clusters to calculate binary masks, selecting four clusters, as the last one represented the background.\\nWe also incorporated automatically estimated egg boundary regions, which we then dilated for inclusion in the evaluation process. In addition to calculating mean values, we counted the number of pixels with values falling within the second (Q2) and third quartiles (Q3), which correspond to over 50% and over 75% of the maximum value, respectively (Table 4). Using these metrics, we aimed to explore the correlation between each species, the intensity of pigmentation, and the shape of the egg based on the border region.\\nDiscussion\\nIn examining our deep learning model’s decision-making through XAI techniques, we found that integrating both Grad-CAM and SHAP DeepExplainer was crucial. Grad-CAM enabled us to visually identify the key image regions influencing predictions, improving our understanding of the model’s attention mechanisms. At the same time, SHAP DeepExplainer offered detailed insights into the contributions of individual pixels or regions. By using these XAI tools, we increased transparency and tackled the interpretability challenges of complex deep learning architectures.\\nData collection\\nOur dataset is notably larger than those in similar studies, containing 2236 eggs from 438 clutches across four bird species [26,39,40]. Our dataset also spans a wide geographic area, including Albania, Algeria, Belarus, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, and the West Bank. This extensive dataset supports XAI methods, enhances the validity of our results, and allows for a broader analysis of pigmentation patterns across multiple species.\\nSpecies classification\\nWe employed the VGG16 model, a well-established CNN, in various training scenarios. Initially, we explored three augmentation strategies to assess their influence on the model’s performance. We incorporated rotation into the augmentation process to enhance the model’s ability to handle objects at various angles. Similarly, we used random cropping to improve the model’s resilience to changes in object placement. We also adjusted contrast and brightness to enhance the model’s accuracy and promote more consistent predictions. We observed consistent results across all augmentation methods, demonstrating the model’s strong ability to generalize. For future experiments, we chose heavy augmentation, as it is likely to produce the most invariant model.\\nNext, we addressed the common challenge of imbalanced class distributions in biological and biomedical datasets. We experimented with oversampling techniques, using augmentation and balanced sampling, which involved oversampling minority classes and undersampling majority classes. The results highlighted the positive impact of balancing the dataset on evaluation metrics.\\nThird, we trained and tested the model using images of different sizes. We used three dimensions: 256 × 256 pixels, which represented the largest size with intricate details; 128 × 128 pixels for the second input size; and 64 × 64 pixels for the third size, which significantly reduced the detail. The smallest size provided a coarse representation of the patterned egg image, highlighting only the major features. Despite this reduction in detail, our results remained consistently strong, with only minor decreases in predictions for certain classes. This suggests that the features crucial for classification do not rely solely on fine details or a small number of pixels from high-quality images. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative patterns persist even when resizing images to much smaller dimensions.\\nGrad-CAM heatmaps\\nWe applied the Grad-CAM procedure separately to both Block 5 and Block 4 of the VGG16 architecture, which allowed us to identify and interpret the specific contributions of features at different levels of abstraction. By examining the class activation maps produced from these distinct blocks, we gained insights into the hierarchical importance of various image regions for the model’s predictions.\\nExamining the aggregated heatmaps generated from the final convolution block (Block 5) reveals a significant impact, primarily at the central and blunt end of the egg. Notably, the great gray shrike (the species in row C of Fig 3) exhibits a strong influence on the peripheral area of the images in the final convolution block, which warrants further investigation. Heatmaps from the middle blocks (Blocks 3 and 4) show increased focus on the peripheral areas along the boundary of the egg. Block 4 places slightly more attention on the blunt end. In contrast, the results from Block 2 show visible texture, but no major impact is distinguishable.\\nExploring the separate results can provide additional insights into which structures, such as spots, texture, or color, have the greatest influence on the classification process. This analysis aims to identify the specific features that drive the model’s decision-making, helping us better understand the network’s behavior.\\nRed-backed shrike\\nBased on Block 4 and Block 5, we can infer that the model focuses on both ends of the egg. In Block 4, the attention focuses on the sharp end of the egg, while Block 5 focuses on the opposite, blunt end. Block 5 indicates regions with spots, mainly within the characteristic ring surrounding the blunt end. Surmacki et al. also highlighted the area known as the “crown” in their study on the relationship between red-backed shrike eggshell patterns and egg size [26]. Their findings suggest that features like the crown pattern and pigmentation traits, including contrast differences between the two ends of the egg, have low reproducibility. Miksik et al. note that protoporphyrin IX levels vary significantly in red-backed shrike eggs, potentially influencing XAI’s attention [18]. Positive SHAP values appear in areas corresponding to spots in the egg’s central region, with the greatest impact linked to spots with moderate contrast, rather than the darkest. We highlight the importance of these positive SHAP values, as high-contrast spots may result from environmental factors. The red-backed shrike usually lays five eggs, one per day, exposing each egg to different environmental influences during its formation [41]. SHAP’s focus on spots of moderate contrast suggests that some patterns may be independent of environmental influences and could serve as unique identifiers for the female.\\nConversely, SHAP results reveal a positive impact concentrated near the object’s border, indicating the importance of shape in the decision-making process. DeepExplainer consistently identifies specific spots, which are typically located within the major impact area of the Block 4 Grad-CAM heatmap.\\nLesser gray shrike\\nIn most samples from the lesser gray shrike species, SHAP values concentrate in the egg’s peripheral area, suggesting that the overall shape plays a crucial role in this class. This finding was further supported by quantifying pixels with positive values. Additionally, SHAP values show that regions tend to have more impact than specific spots, indicating a distinctive overall pattern rather than individual spots for this species. More pixels with positive values appeared in cluster_2 than in clusters with lower numbers, further confirming this observation. While Grad-CAM results for this species may seem inconsistent, they consistently focus on the patterned part of the egg, emphasizing its general significance over other features. We suggest that in lesser gray shrikes, individual-specific signatures are encoded in the spatial arrangement of pigment patches, similar to the signatures described for common crane (Grus grus) eggs [42]. The eggs of the lesser gray shrike have a distinctive greenish background that sets them apart from other Lanius species. This makes it easy to identify lesser gray shrike eggs in oological collections and likely prevents birds from accepting parasitic eggs—unless it involves intraspecies parasitism. In such cases, the female’s unique blot pigment pattern in specific areas of the egg may determine whether it is accepted or rejected from the nest.\\nGreat gray shrike\\nSHAP results strongly suggest that the egg’s background color significantly influences the classification of the great gray shrike. The darkest pigmentation spots also have a significant impact, both observable and quantifiable. Overall, all SHAP results consistently highlight that the most patterned and dark-spotted areas are crucial in classifying this species.\\nIn the Grad-CAM evaluation, the model focuses slightly more on the blunt end of the egg. However, the overall trend shows attention across the entire object, without pinpointing any specific region, further confirming the impact of the eggshell’s background color.\\nThe great gray shrike is the largest species in the genus Lanius. Compared to other members of the genus, it builds the highest and best-concealed nests and displays remarkable courage in actively defending them [43]. Consequently, we hypothesize that this species faces the least evolutionary pressure to develop complex individual egg signatures. Instead, the egg’s background color may be sufficient for intraspecies communication between the sexes.\\nWoodchat shrike\\nThe Grad-CAM heatmaps for this class show a remarkable focus, concentrating on small areas of the eggs. This intensity matches the SHAP results, where only a few regions with strong values appear in the analysis. Intriguingly, even in eggs with many spots, the model seems to base its decision on just a few. Further investigation is needed to determine whether size, shape, or color plays a key role in this context.\\nStudies on red-backed shrike egg characteristics suggest that environmental factors primarily influence egg size and shape, rather than shell pigmentation [26]. Consequently, eggshell pigmentation may be a heritable trait, making it more susceptible to evolutionary changes compared to environmental factors. This trait could play a key role in avoiding brood parasitism and, as such, may be shaped by natural selection. However, aside from studies on red-backed shrike eggs, similar relationships have not been explored in other Lanius species. Our study, which includes four species from this genus, suggests that lesser gray shrikes and great gray shrikes focus on developing unique eggshell backgrounds. In contrast, red-backed shrikes and woodchat shrikes depend on specific pigment patterns and spatial arrangements to identify their eggs. These differences may result from various biological factors specific to each species, such as nesting periods, individual body mass, nest height and concealment, and the presence or abundance of predators and nest parasites in breeding habitats.\\nMisclassifications\\nThe most common misclassifications occurred between red-backed shrike and woodchat shrike species. We observed frequent misclassifications in both directions. The CNN assigned probabilities for these misclassified instances ranging from 51% to 98%. This range reflects varying levels of model confidence, from uncertain decisions (around 51%) to highly confident yet incorrect classifications (up to 98%).\\nGrad-CAM heatmaps show focused attention on the spotted areas of the eggs. The SHAP results reveal a noticeable mix of positive and negative values, which contrasts with the true positive classification XAI results, where SHAP values show more consistency. In the misclassified samples, we observe that specific spots have a major impact, highlighting their importance over the shape of the border or the characteristics of the blunt or pointy ends. Conversely, it appears that the model considered the shape of the spots rather than their color when making decisions.\\nThe classifier’s second most common error is predicting lesser gray shrike for images of woodchat shrike. Grad-CAM heatmaps show that the model focuses on patterned areas near the blunt end in these cases. In most instances, positive SHAP values highlight specific spots as key to the classification. The ambiguity of these spots likely caused the misclassification, as the classifier’s probabilities ranged from 53% to 75%.\\nInsights and prospects\\nAs image complexity increases, interpretation becomes much more difficult. The gap in complexity between simple image classification tasks and the detailed analyses required for specific biological questions is vast. In general image interpretation, SHAP DeepExplainer provides clear insights into how individual pixels or features influence model decisions. For instance, in tasks like distinguishing between storks and herons, SHAP easily shows that positive values link to areas with long red beaks and legs, helping to explain the model’s predictions. This simple correlation simplifies interpretation, offering a clear path to understanding why the model makes certain classifications. In contrast to simpler tasks, analyzing the contributions of individual features in more complex scenarios requires deeper analysis.\\nIn this study, we utilized a CNN to develop a model for classifying shrike eggs from museum collections, unlike Chen et al., who applied CNNs to identify poultry eggs [40]. We did not use egg dimensions, as Surmacki et al. did [26], though we collected these measurements and plan to include them in future papers. Inspired by another stimulating research [6], we aimed to address the challenge of identifying individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface, similar to Gómez et al.’s work with the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra) using SpotEgg, an image processing software [39]. The authors concluded that evaluating egg phenotypes requires considering all factors—color, pattern, shape, and size—simultaneously. At the same time, Surmacki et al. [26] pointed out the repetitive nature of egg patterns, along with variations in egg size.\\nWe used machine learning models with explainability techniques to identify the specific features that distinguish each species. While the model performed well in predicting species, we found it difficult to identify clear characteristic features. Nonetheless, our investigation revealed general trends, such as the model’s focus on dark or light spots and peripheral areas of the egg. To improve our study, we plan to experiment with handcrafted features specific to characteristic areas of the egg. With further development, our approach could not only enhance our understanding of how birds perceive eggs but also help organize oological collections. In the future, CNNs are expected to verify the species affiliation of eggs in oological collections worldwide. However, researchers have primarily focused on brood parasitism [7,44,45], CNNs are increasingly used for egg classification and detecting parasitic eggs. Recently, Marini et al. [46] conducted an extensive inventory of about 5 million eggs (roughly 1.97 million egg sets) stored in museums worldwide. These collections, built over the past 250 years, peaked in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Afterward, egg collection became restricted and eventually banned in many regions. Today, analyzing eggs from existing collections offers significant and unique research opportunities [47,48]. However, many stored eggs or egg sets lack clear or legible labels. For example, in Europe, many stored eggs need reidentification (verification) due to lost catalogs from the war period. CNNs can improve oological studies by enhancing identification accuracy and increasing the number of observations for specific bird species.\\nConclusion\\nWe conclude the present results of the investigation indicate that the VGG16 deep learning classification model can distinguish between the four Lanius species. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.957 ± 0.015 with input images of size 256 × 256 pixels, which is promising. However, we aim to refine the model further by incorporating a broader spectrum of species during training. Unfortunately, our attempt to utilize XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns for species-wide identification signatures produced inconclusive results. In the future, we hope to identify correlations between features associated with individual maternal signatures on the eggshell surface. To achieve this, we plan to apply a hybrid approach that integrates classical image processing techniques, which focus on hand-crafted and more comprehensible features, with deep learning methods. Overall, our approach offers a new way to study how animals perceive signals encoded in eggs.\\nMaterials and methods\\nIn this study, we aimed to apply XAI methods to uncover pigmentation patterns that represent species-wide identification signatures. We established a classification model using a CNN to classify four species of the shrike family (Laniidae): red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), lesser gray shrike (L. minor), great gray shrike (L. excubitor), and woodchat shrike (L. senator). We obtained the image dataset from several museum collections. Collecting eggshell data from bird species is challenging due to ethical considerations that often restrict or prevent sampling from wildlife populations. Consequently, ethical review boards rarely approve large-scale data collection from live specimens, making museum collections a vital resource for avian egg research. Furthermore, we augmented and resized digital images to train the classifier. We selected the VGG16 machine learning model for the classification task, and it produced promising results. Its compatibility and ease of use allowed us to apply XAI techniques, including Grad-CAM and SHAP, to interpret the model’s decisions.\\nData collection, digital photography, and shrike species\\nWe photographed a total of 2236 eggs from 438 nests across four species of the shrike family, Laniidae. This included 1304 eggs from 267 nests of the red-backed shrike (L. collurio), 214 eggs from 41 nests of the lesser gray shrike (L. minor), 376 eggs from 67 nests of the great gray shrike (L. excubitor), and 342 eggs from 62 nests of the woodchat shrike (L. senator). We excluded any nest (clutch) with unclear details, such as uncertain collection year, location, or maternal lineage. This approach also prevented analyzing multiple clutches from the same female.\\nWe took photographs at six sites housing oological collections: five in Poland and one in Germany. These sites are: (1) Świętokrzyski National Park, Bodzentyn, Poland; (2) Count Antoni Ostrowski Museum in Tomaszow Mazowiecki, Poland; (3) Museum and Institute of Zoology Polish Academy of Sciences Research Station, Palmiry, Poland; (4) Museum of Natural History, University of Wrocław, Poland; (5) Jacek Malczewski Museum in Radom, Poland; and (6) Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden, Germany (Fig 5b). Table 5 shows the number of clutches and eggs per species. All eggs used in this study were blown eggs stored in closed cabinets, with no access to light, which prevented any changes in shell color. After removing the eggs from the display case, we measured the mass, length, and width of each shell before proceeding with the photography.\\nPresentation of (A) mounted equipment during one of the photo sessions; (B) drawer with great gray shrike eggs from the Senckenberg Natural History Collections Dresden, Germany; (C) photographing procedure of a single shrike egg; (D) single red-backed shrike egg with the standardized color chart Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini and a label showing the clutch number; and (E) full clutch of red-backed shrike eggs with the standardized color chart Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini and a genuine collection label.\\nWe took all photos using a Canon® EOS M50 Mark II camera with a Canon® Zoom Lens EF-M 15–45 mm and a Hoya® CIR-PL UV filter. We used the same settings for each photo: aperture f/11, shutter speed 1/60, and ISO 200. Before photographing, we placed the eggs in a shadeless tent, the GlareOne® LED Cube 60 (Fig 5a), along with a standardized color chart, the Calibrite® ColorChecker Classic Mini (Fig 5d,e). We used a tripod and remote control for stability during the process. Each egg was photographed twice: after the first shot, we rotated the egg 180 degrees. In total, we took 4472 photos (2 photos for each of the 2236 eggs).\\nDataset formation\\nWe used our method to automatically create an image database from the collected photographs. Although we took the images following a repetitive scheme, preprocessing [49,50] was essential for AI-driven analysis. We applied an automated method to extract the eggs, cropping them out and organizing them into file-folder structures that efficiently fed the images to the AI model. We manually pruned the dataset to remove artifacts, eggs marked with tags, extraneous objects, and cracked eggs. Ultimately, we curated a dataset of 3260 images, ready for use in CNN training.\\nDeep learning model and implementation\\nIn our experiments, we used the widely recognized VGG16 model [51], adapting its input and output layers to meet our specific objectives (Fig 6). This architecture has proven efficient in a variety of applications, from microscopy scans [52–54] to satellite images [55]. Notably, we initialized the model’s weights randomly. For optimization, we primarily used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-6 and a momentum value of 0.9. We chose the “categorical crossentropy” loss function, a standard option for classification tasks. We set the split for train/validation/test subsets to 0.5/0.2/0.3. Throughout all experiments, we used a consistent batch size of 8.\\nWe implemented the model, along with the training and inference processes, in Python using the Keras framework with TensorFlow as the backend. The open-source nature of the model made it easily accessible, and we obtained it from the publicly available GitHub repository [56]. This Python-based implementation provided flexibility and leveraged Keras and TensorFlow’s capabilities for efficient neural network operations. The VGG16 architecture, proven effective in image classification tasks, was modified to meet our specific classification goals. We used SGD with the categorical cross-entropy loss function, following established practices in training deep neural networks.\\nData augmentation\\nIn situations with very few examples, data augmentation can improve the quality of the results. In our study, we used the Albumentations package [57] to modify the images. To systematically introduce diversity, we applied three distinct augmentation strategies: simple, medium, and heavy.\\nSimple.\\nThe simple augmentation involved only vertical and horizontal flips, with image rotation restricted to 180 degrees. This type of augmentation has a minimal impact on image content since it does not affect the pixel values. Nevertheless, it can enhance the model’s training capabilities by making it agnostic to the left-right orientation of the egg.\\nMedium.\\nIn addition to simple augmentation, this strategy included further distortions such as image rotation and random cropping. These transformations applied multiple geometric changes, altering the position of objects within the images.\\nHeavy.\\nAlong with simple and medium augmentations, the heavy option provided additional distortions in brightness and contrast to make the model agnostic to light conditions and automatic camera white balance adjustments. The Albumentation functions used in the heavy augmentation option included: VerticalFlip (p = 0.5), HorizontalFlip (p = 0.5), Rotate (limit=[0,180], p = 0.5), RandomSizedCrop (p = 0.5), RandomBrightnessContrast (p = 0.5), and RandomGamma (p = 0.5).All of the above strategies improve the generalization of knowledge. However, we designed each strategy to cater to different levels of augmentation intensity, allowing us to explore the impact of augmentation on model performance across a range of complexities.\\nFurthermore, we used augmentation techniques to balance the dataset. Notably, we applied the most augmentation to the least populated class to address the imbalance effectively. This approach is crucial for maintaining high accuracy and avoiding misclassifications, especially in applications where each class or category holds equal importance.\\nThe open-source Albumentations package provided a solid foundation for applying these augmentation techniques efficiently. By using these strategies, we enhanced the flexibility of our experimental setup, improving the model’s ability to learn from a limited set of examples. This augmentation process was crucial in overcoming data scarcity challenges, making our trained model more robust and better at generalizing.\\nXAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence)\\nXAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) aims to demystify complex machine learning models by making their decision-making processes understandable to humans [58]. In our study, we used XAI methods, such as Grad-CAM and SHAP, to clarify how our model reaches conclusions. These methods highlight influential regions in images, enabling researchers and users to interpret and trust the model’s outputs. This promotes transparency in artificial intelligence systems.\\nGrad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)\\nGrad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) [59] is a powerful XAI technique that visualizes the regions of an image that strongly influence a deep learning model’s decision. Grad-CAM operates on the final convolutional layer of a CNN, just before the global average pooling and fully connected layers. This layer retains spatial information essential for understanding the model’s decision-making. The process starts by computing the gradients of the target class with respect to the feature maps of the convolutional layer. These gradients represent the importance of each feature map in the decision for the target class. By averaging the gradients for each feature map, we obtain the importance weight for each channel. Next, we compute a weighted combination of the feature maps using these importance weights. This generates a class activation map that highlights the regions of the input image that most influenced the model’s prediction for the target class. To create a visual interpretation, we rescale the class activation map and overlay it onto the original input image. This overlay emphasizes the critical areas that influenced the model’s decision, providing a clear and interpretable'}\n",

Here\\'s an example of GZDoom, and I\\'ll start with flame scopes for both CPU and GPU utilization, with details annotated:\\n(Here are the raw CPU and GPU versions.) FlameScope shows a subsecond-offset heatmap of profile samples, where each column is one second (in this example, made up of 50 x 20ms blocks) and the color depth represents the number of samples, revealing variance and perturbation that you can select to generate a flame graph just for that time range. Update: the row size can be ajusted (it is limited by the sample rate captured in the profile), e.g., you could generate 60 rows to match 60fps games.\\nPutting these CPU and GPU flame scopes side by side has enabled your eyes to do pattern matching to solve what would otherwise be a time-consuming task of performance correlation. The gaps in the GPU flame scope on the right – where the GPU was not doing much work – match the heavier periods of CPU work on the left.\\nCPU Analysis\\nFlameScope lets us click on the interesting periods. By selecting one of the CPU shader compilation stripes we get the flame graph just for that range:\\nThis is brilliant, and we can see exactly why the CPUs were busy for about 180 ms (the vertical length of the red stripe): it\\'s doing compilation of GPU shaders and some NIR preprocessing (optimizations to the NIR intermediate representation that Mesa uses internally). If you are new to flame graphs, you look for the widest towers and optimize them first. Here is the interactive SVG.\\nCPU flame graphs and CPU flame scope aren\\'t new (from 2011 and 2018, both open source). What is new is full-stack GPU flame graphs and GPU flame scope.\\nGPU Analysis\\nInteresting details can also be selected in the GPU FlameScope for generating GPU flame graphs. This example selects the \"room 3\" range, which is a room in the Doom map that contains hundreds of enemies. The green frames are the actual instructions running on the GPU, aqua shows the source for these functions, and red (C) and yellow (C++) show the CPU code paths that initiated the GPU programs. The gray \"-\" frames just help highlight the boundary between CPU and GPU code. (This is similar to what I described in the AI flame graphs post, which included extra frames for kernel code.) The x-axis is proportional to cost, so you look for the widest things and find ways to reduce them.\\nI\\'ve included the interactive SVG version of this flame graph so you can mouse-over elements and click to zoom. (PNG version.)\\nThe GPU flame graph is split between stalls coming from rendering walls (41.4%), postprocessing effects (35.7%), stenciling (17.2%), and sprites (4.95%). The CPU stacks are further differentiated by the individual shaders that are causing stalls, along with the reasons for those stalls.\\nGZDoom\\nWe picked GZDoom to try since it\\'s an open source version of a well known game that runs on Linux (our profiler does not support Windows yet). Intel Battlemage makes light work of GZDoom, however, and since the GPU profile is stall-based we weren\\'t getting many samples. We could have switched to a more modern and GPU-demanding game, but didn\\'t have any great open source ideas, so I figured we\\'d just make GZDoom more demanding. We built GPU demanding maps for GZDoom (I can\\'t believe I have found a work-related reason to be using Slade), and also set some Battlemage tunables to limit resources, magnifying the utilization of remaining resources.\\nOur GZDoom test map has three rooms: room 1 is empty, room 2 is filled with torches, and room 3 is open with a large skybox and filled with enemies, including spawnpoints for Sergeants. This gave us a few different workloads to examine by walking between the rooms.\\nUsing iaprof: Intel\\'s open source accelerator profiler\\nThe AI Flame Graph project is pioneering work, and has needed various changes to graphics compilers, libraries, and kernel drivers, not just the code but also how they are built. Since Intel has its own public cloud (the Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud) we can fix the software stack in advance so that for customers it \"just works.\" Check the available releases. It currently supports the Intel Max Series GPU.\\nIf you aren\\'t on the Intel cloud, or you wish to try this with Intel Battlemage, then it can require a lot of work to get the system ready to be profiled. Requirements include:\\n- A Linux system with superuser (root) access, so that eBPF and Intel eustalls can be used.\\n- A newer Linux kernel with the latest Intel GPU drivers. For Intel Battlemage this means Linux 6.15+ with the Xe driver; For the Intel Max Series GPU it\\'s Linux 5.15 with the i915 driver.\\n- The Linux kernel built with Intel driver-specific eustall and eudebug interfaces (see the github docs for details). Some of these modifications are upstreamed in the latest versions of Linux and others are currently in progress. (These interfaces are made available by default on the Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud.)\\n- All system libraries or programs that are being profiled need to include frame pointers so that the full stacks are visible, including Intel\\'s oneAPI and graphics libraries. For this example, GZDoom itself needed to be compiled with frame pointers and also all libraries used by GZDoom (glibc, etc.). This is getting easier in the lastest versions of Fedora and Ubuntu (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) which are shipping system libraries with frame pointers by default. But I\\'d expect there will be applications and dependencies that don\\'t have frame pointers yet, and need recompilation. If your flame graph has areas that are very short, one or two frames deep, this is why.\\nIf you are new to custom kernel builds and library tinkering, then getting this all working may feel like Nightmare! difficulty. Over time things will improve and gradually get easier: check the github docs. Intel can also develop a much easier version of this tool as part of a broader product offering and get it working on more than just Linux and Battlemage (either watch this space or, if you have an Intel rep, ask them to make it a priority).\\nOnce you have it all working, you can run the iaprof command to profile the GPU. E.g.:\\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/intel/iaprof cd iaprof make deps make sudo iaprof record > profile.txt cat profile.txt | iaprof flame > flame.svg\\niaprof is modeled on the Linux perf command. (Maybe one day it\\'ll become included in perf directly.) Thanks to Gabriel Muñoz for getting the work done to get this open sourced.\\nFAQ and Future Work\\nFrom the launch of AI flame graphs last year, I can guess what FAQ #1 will be: “What about NVIDIA?”. They do have flame graphs in Nsight Graphics for GPU workloads, although their flame graphs are currently shallow as it is GPU code only, and onerous to use as I believe it requires an interposer; on the plus side they have click-to-source. The new GPU profiling method we\\'ve been developing allows for easy, everything, anytime profiling, like you expect from CPU profilers.\\nFuture work will include github releases, more hardware support, and overhead reduction. We\\'re the first to use eustalls in this way, and we need to add more optimization to reach our target of <5% overhead, especially with the i915 driver.\\nConclusion\\nWe\\'ve open sourced AI flame graphs and tested it on new hardware, Intel Battlemage, and a non-AI workload: GZDoom (gaming). It\\'s great to see a view of both CPU and GPU resources down to millisecond resolution, where we can see visual patterns in the flame scope heat maps that can be selected to produce flame graphs to show the code. We applied these new tools to GZDoom and explained GPU pauses by selecting the corresponding CPU burst and reading the flame graph, as well as GPU code use for arbitrary time windows.\\nWhile we have open sourced this, getting it all running requires Intel hardware and Linux kernel and library tinkering – which can be a lot of work. (Actually playing Doom on Nightmare! difficulty may be easier.) This will get better over time. We look forward to seeing if anyone can fight their way through this work in the meantime and what new performance issues they can solve.\\nAuthors: Brendan Gregg, Ben Olson, Brandon Kammerdiener, Gabriel Muñoz.\\nClick here for Disqus comments (ad supported).'}\n",

With the advent of new technology, cybercriminals have upped their game to bypass conventional fraud detection systems. In response to this global crisis, AI expert Pallav Kumar Kaulwar has published his insightful research highlighting the role of\\nHis published paper “Generative AI in Financial Intelligence: Unraveling its Potential in Risk Assessment and Compliance” explains how emerging financial threats can be simulated, detected, and neutralized by deep learning architectures such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), Bayesian neural networks, and variation auto encoders.\\nA New Approach to Fraud Detection\\nEvery year, financial frauds account for the loss of billions of dollars around the world. Unfortunately, conventional detection methods have failed to keep up with this growing concern. Rule-based engines relying on fixed thresholds and historical fraud signatures are no match for today’s technologically astute cybercriminals.\\nIn his research, Kaulwar has identified several limitations of the traditional fraud detection models. Most importantly, static rules can be bypassed effortlessly by fraudsters that continuously evolve their methods with each breach. Also, though supervised learning models are powerful, they need extensive labeled datasets, which are difficult to find for new fraud types. Finally, traditional models are known to generate a high volume of false positives.\\n“The industry needs a shift from reaction to prediction,” says Kaulwar. “Today’s fraud detection must be dynamic, data-rich, and capable of identifying new patterns as they emerge-before they escalate into large-scale breaches.”\\nKaulwar believes that generative AI’s ability to create, simulate, and test a wide range of scenarios can be a game changer in this context. Institutions can proactively identify fraudulent transactions and intervene in real-time by training models to mimic normal as well as abnormal behavior.\\nEnhancing Financial Surveillance with Generative AI\\nUnlike traditional analytics, generative AI has the capability to generate synthetic data mirroring real-world financial behaviors. Therefore, organizations can build robust detection models, even if they don’t have extensive fraud datasets. Financial institutions can leverage tools such as GANs to simulate thousands of behavior scenarios, identity patterns, and transaction paths. As a result, it is possible to detect vulnerabilities that are missed by static models.\\nLeveraging this approach, Kaulwar’s framework creates\\nIn the context of AML (Anti-Money Laundering), complex layering and structuring techniques used by criminals can be simulated by generative models. When used to train detection engines, these simulations can enhance their sensitivity to subtle laundering signals. Generative models can also prevent payment fraud by creating behavioral biometrics capable of identifying account takeovers based on session anomalies or keystroke dynamics.\\nIt is possible to update generative AI systems in real-time with new fraud data, ensuring quick adaptation to new attack vectors. They can also be integrated seamlessly with existing financial intelligence platforms.\\nHuman-in-the-Loop Oversight\\nOne of the key aspects of Kaulwar’s research is the balance between automation and human judgment. According to him, while AI is critical to scalability and speed, human oversight remains essential for ethical alignment, governance, and contextual decision-making. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) design of his framework ensures that only experts are involved in validation and escalation of critical fraud decisions.\\nThe growing concerns around AI explainability are also addressed by Kaulwar’s framework. In addition to detecting frauds, financial institutions should explain why a particular transaction was flagged. In his generative systems, explainable AI (XAI) modules present a clear rationale for each alert by tracing the decision path of the AI model.\\nThis dual-layer approach is critical to enabling regulatory resilience. Every second matters in fast-moving environments like the capital market. While initial detection is handled by frontline AI, compliance teams are engaged in reviewing and responding to critical incidents.\\nConclusion\\nAs fraudsters are now evolving their tactics using advanced technology, financial institutions must evolve even faster to stay ahead of them. Kaulwar’s research provides an actionable framework for building intelligent, proactive, explainable, and resilient fraud detection systems. His insights can help financial institutions meet the challenges of an increasingly digital, complex, and high-speed financial landscape.\\n“Generative AI represents a major step forward into a future where machines are not only learning to recognize forms and patterns but also have an imagination of their own. This imagination integrates into our processes and contexts, capturing human potential for interpreting vast financial data that has hardly been tapped. Such systems enable us to work constructively with data oases rather than be limited by data droughts,” Kaulwar concludes.'}\n",

This collaborative study explores how\\nWith over a decade of experience in Oracle technologies, cloud computing, and enterprise integration, Polineni has a track record of addressing real-world healthcare challenges leveraging his technical acumen. Through his research, he has highlighted the potential of generative neural networks, real-time data integration, and predictive analytics for enhancing clinical decision-making in trauma environments.\\nEmergency Care through AI\\nEmergency departments (EDs) are extremely resource-intensive units that are known to operate under tremendous pressure, attending patients with varying degrees of severity and often missing or incomplete health records. Clinicians in these units are often required to make life-altering decisions within tight timeframes on the basis of limited information. Any inefficiency in triage or delay in diagnosis can significantly affect patient outcomes in such environments.\\nThrough his research, Polineni has recommended a fundamental shift in how facilities structure emergency care. He mentions that clinical decision-making can be augmented with data-driven insights by introducing AI tools. These systems can analyze vast datasets in real time, including patient histories, environmental variables, imaging results, and physiological data to generate probabilistic assessments of severity and risk. By identifying critical conditions before symptoms escalate, AI empowers emergency departments to transition from reactive to proactive care.\\nDiagnostic and triage procedures can also be standardized by AI, which reduces human error and subjectivity. This can be extremely beneficial in under-resourced or rural settings where availability of trained specialists can be a concern. In order to reduce misdiagnoses, increase efficiency, and save lives, hospitals can embed intelligent tools throughout their emergency response workflow.\\nEarly Diagnosis and Prognosis\\nThe core concept of Polineni’s research revolves around advanced generative neural network models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These models are extremely efficient in early diagnosis and prognostic modeling, two most acute challenges in trauma care. These models are custom engineered to overcome practical issues such as variability in patient presentations, data scarcity, and lack of consistent expert labeling in clinical data.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are capable of generating synthetic patient data mirroring diagnostic patterns or real-world imaging, which provides training datasets for underrepresented or rare conditions. On the other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can compress and reconstruct medical images efficiently. This improves detection of features and patterns that might elude the human eye.\\nIt is possible to train these models to identify the subtle indicators of conditions such as sepsis, internal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and even complex multi-organ failure within moments. These tools can empower physicians to make decisions reflecting immediate as well as long-term implications of trauma.\\nReal-Time Decision Support Systems\\nThe concept of decision support systems has been used in the healthcare sector for many years. However, Polineni claims that the integration of\\nAdaptability is one of the key compatibilities of these systems. Whether deployed in a remote field hospital or a bustling metropolitan trauma center, real-time DSS can scale as per the requirement. They assist in resource allocation, prioritize patients during a surge, and even coordinate care handovers between facilities.\\nAI for Enhancing Triage and Emergency Response\\nAs it is the foundational step in emergency care, any delay or misclassification at the triage stage can lead to life-threatening consequences. In his study, Polineni has discussed AI-enhanced triage models that are not only capable of accelerating patient sorting, but also improving accuracy by factoring in subtle indicators that human indicators tend to miss.\\nUsing large datasets to train generative models, these systems can detect time-critical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, internal bleeding, or early signs of sepsis. By helping track patient disposition, AI ensuring continuity of care from pre-hospital settings to specialized treatment facilities.\\nField Applications\\nPolineni has illustrated the impact of AI-driven DSS through a series of real-world use cases.\\n- Pediatric Trauma Triage: By training AI tools on pediatric-specific datasets, clinicians can be assisted in identifying atypical vital sign patterns. This can help detect serious injuries such as concussion or internal bleeding in a timely manner.\\n- Emergency Radiology Interpretation: AI algorithms trained on thousands of annotated images can precisely identify anomalies in MRI or CT scans. By highlighting suspected areas of concern, these tools allow radiologists to reduce interpretation time during peak hours and prioritize critical cases.\\n- Prehospital Trauma Response: Equipped with AI-assisted mobile devices, emergency responders can input basic patient data on-site. Based on this data, the system generates a severity index and recommends the most suitable facility.\\n- Burn and Wound Severity Assessment: Based on historical outcomes, AI-enhanced image analysis can detect infection risk, classify burn depths, and recommend treatment protocols.\\nFinal Thoughts\\nTulasi Naga Subhash Polineni’s research has created a comprehensive blueprint that can define the future of trauma and acute care leveraging AI-driven decision support systems.\\n“Our aim is not just to enhance diagnostic accuracy but to fundamentally rethink how trauma and acute care can be delivered-faster, smarter, and more personalized,” concludes Tulasi Naga Subhash Polineni. “AI-driven decision support systems hold the potential to bridge critical care gaps, reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately save lives in time-sensitive emergencies. By integrating real-time insights into existing clinical workflows, we can empower caregivers to act with greater precision when it matters most.”\"}\n",

The company did not say how much of that investment converted to equity in the first quarter, but it now values its overall stake in the AI startup at $13.8 billion, the filing says.\\nA shift from convertible notes to equity is commonly made when a convertible note reaches a milestone — such as a funding threshold, valuation target, or maturity date — leading a shift from debt-like terms to equity ownership under the original investment agreement.\\nThe $3.3 billion pre-tax gain came from a change in how the investment is counted on Amazon’s books. When the company held convertible notes, any increase in their value didn’t show up in its profits. With those notes converting into stock, Amazon was required to move those paper gains onto its income statement — effectively turning them into real profit for accounting purposes.\\nThe gain boosted Amazon’s first-quarter results, which included net income (after tax) of $17.1 billion, or $1.59 per share — well above analyst expectations of $1.36 per share.\\nThe size of the investment gain reflects just how much Anthropic’s value has grown since 2023, when Amazon announced its initial investment in the San Francisco-based AI company.\\nThe startup, which also makes the Sonnet AI model, was valued at $61.5 billion in its March funding round, making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world, according to a Bloomberg News report at the time.\\nAmazon’s partnership with Anthropic goes beyond investment.

CSI: Cyber, on the other hand, lasted just two seasons. Past audiences, it seems, preferred plots with crimes like murder and burglary over more esoteric topics like ARP spoofing and DNS poisoning.\\nWith an RSAC 2025 Conference panel titled “Hot! Sizzling Cyber Law Topics,” four lawyers spotlight the unique challenges of current criminal law in the cyber realm, from the rights of AI holograms to the privacy of your own thoughts.\\nRuth Bro, a privacy and cybersecurity attorney, noted that we have been concerned about technology affecting our privacy for decades. She offered numerous examples from music and film and highlighted an 1890 law review article by Louis Brandeis (long before he joined the Supreme Court) on the right to privacy, spurred at the time by the spread of cheap photography.\\nBro offered an acronym for the biggest dangers technology brings to privacy: BAD, short for biometrics, AI, and drones. “Biometric is one of the most sensitive types of data,” she said. “And AI holds staggering amounts of personal data.”\\nAs for drones, she offered examples both good and bad. Insurance companies fly drones over your property. If you don\\'t take care of it, they could raise your rates or drop your coverage entirely. On the other hand, having a drone fly in ahead of first responders can get help to victims faster and decrease risks to the responders.\\nAI Hologram Rights and Wrongs\\nTed Claypoole, partner at Womble Bond Dickinson LLP, spoke about replacing human performers with AI-powered holograms. He highlighted the Elvis Evolution Experience, coming to London this summer, as an example of how far the entertainment industry can go if allowed. This performance has the blessing of The King’s estate, so there’s no legal trouble.\\nBefore AI deepfakes, we did see hologram shows, most notably Tupac Shakur’s posthumous performance. Anyone wanting to fight such usage would have to rely on deceptive practice laws, trademark and copyright protection, and state-specific laws protecting a person\\'s name, image, and likeness. But that’s changing.\\nTennessee has passed the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and Image Security Act (yes, it spells ELVIS), which prohibits deepfakes and makes publishing them a class A misdemeanor. “You can sue,” noted Claypoole, “or the record company can sue on behalf of the artist.” And it’s also a crime. Claypoole concluded that if you make an AI hologram, you’d better use someone long dead or get permission. Similarly, the Take It Down Act cleared the US Congress, which makes creating or publishing non-consensual deepfake images or videos a federal crime.\\nRegulators Take Aim at Algorithmic Discrimination\\nLucy Thomson, principal at Livingston PLLC, spotlighted regulations restricting companies from using AI in software development. She highlighted the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, which takes effect in February 2026, that requires developers and deployers of AI-powered software to protect customers from algorithmic discrimination in high-risk systems.\\nEnsure humans are in control, not just in the loop.\\n\"A high-risk system is one that makes a substantial factor in making a consequential decision about a consumer,” she explained. Specifically, this affects decisions relating to education, employment, lending, government services, health, housing, insurance, and legal actions. The European Union provides similar, but broader, protections. She concluded the most crucial point is to “ensure humans are in control, not just in the loop.”\\nThe Federal Government Tackles AI Washing\\n“New! Improved! Now with AI!” How many times have you heard that pitch? Kristin Madigan, partner at Crowell & Moring, discussed new laws against “AI washing,” which she explained consists of “representations to the market where you use AI to supercharge existing deceptive practices, or overstate AI capabilities.”\\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have all shown an interest in controlling these deceptive practices. “Your claims about AI had better be true,” concluded Moring.\\nThe Rise of \\'Neuro Privacy\\'\\nClaypoole reclaimed the mic to discuss what he calls “I know what you thought last summer.”\\nStay Safe With the Latest Security News and Updates\\nBy clicking Sign Me Up, you confirm you are 16+ and agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\\n“It’s an interesting area,” he said. “You think we’re talking about the future, but we’re not.” He flagged an article in The Atlantic from 2013 where the author sat for a test using an fMRI machine while viewing pictures. Even a layperson looking at the fMRI could tell what he thought about the photos, and the article posed the question, \"Could the government get a search warrant for your thoughts?\"\\nI know what you thought last summer.\\nIn the modern world, devices of all kinds record data related to our thinking. Some truckers wear hats that detect sleepiness. Other gadgets include headbands, wristbands, earbuds, smart glasses, and even implanted brain links.\\nAlways forward-looking, the EU has proposed five human rights in the area of neurodata: cognitive liberty (the freedom to opt out of having your mental processes recorded or modified), mental privacy (the freedom to conceal mental information), mental integrity (a prohibition on non-consensual changes to a person’s thinking), psychological continuity (the right to preserve your identity from non-consensual modification), and fair access (ensuring that positive outcomes in the neuro field are shared fairly).\\nSoftware Supply Chain Hacks Are Expensive Legal Problems\\nLucy Thomson mentioned that attacks on the software supply chain, like the major attacks on SolarWinds, Log4j, and the Kaseya ransomware attack, all have significant legal ramifications that often go undiscussed. She noted that the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) maintains a detailed document on software supply chain attacks.\\n“Cybersecurity attacks can expose attorneys to third-party liability,” said Thomson. She cited several examples that settled for $8 million or more and suggested that law firms must consider the risks of such lawsuits and hold software vendors accountable for security outcomes.\\nWhat Overturning Chevron Means for Cybersecurity\\nFor over 40 years, the Chevron deference held that when a federal law needs interpretation, that task is best left to experts in the agency responsible for the law. The Supreme Court invalidated that doctrine last year.\\nMadigan reviewed the consequences and explained that “courts will have greater authority to overturn or modify laws.” She continued, “When it comes to cybersecurity, many federal regulations predate modern cyber threats. We’re more likely to see court challenges in cyber-related decisions.”\\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, many federal regulations pre-date modern cyber threats.\\nMadigan says we’ll likely see more rollbacks on rules and regulations when it comes to information security. According to the Center for Cybersecurity Policy, this could mean more companies going to court to challenge cybersecurity and privacy laws, including federal regulations on when and how companies have to report security breaches to clients and customers, for example.\\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\\nWhat can the legal profession do to stay ahead of the collision between law and cybersecurity? Quoting Peter Parker’s uncle Ben, Bro observed that “with great power comes great responsibility.” For example, just because widespread surveillance is possible doesn’t mean it’s a wise choice. She advised holding software vendors accountable for security. “Don’t be creepy,” she admonished. “I tell people, before you do that, think about whether you’ll look good on the cover of the Wall Street Journal.”\\nCybersecurity-related plotlines are already appearing in popular TV legal dramas, and we’ll only see more going forward. Who knows, the topics from this discussion may be the plotlines for coming episodes.\\nRead the latest from Neil J.

Whether leading strategy at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or launching generative AI tools to combat financial crime at Fintrac, Lalonde says he’s always been chasing that same feeling: “In every single one of my jobs, I was always looking to make that difference.”\\nBridging tech and trust in the public sector\\nAt IAAC, Lalonde is guiding the agency through another ambitious transformation. This time, it’s about applying artificial intelligence to one of the most complex and politically sensitive mandates in government: environmental impact assessment.\\n“Our job is to look at all the major projects in Canada — pipelines, offshore drilling, mines — and find a balance of advancing these projects and preserving the environment,” he explains. That includes meaningful consultation with Indigenous communities, which his team has made more accessible through redesigned digital platforms.\\nBut faster doesn’t mean automated. Lalonde is clear that AI isn’t replacing the human judgment at the heart of these decisions — it’s supporting it. In fact, that’s the core of his strategy: using AI to enhance, not override, the critical thinking, values, and responsibilities that define public service.\\nOne of the biggest barriers to adoption, he says, is fear — fear among staff that AI is coming for their jobs.\\n“When we built a model specifically to say we are not going to replace you… all of a sudden that fear started to diminish,” he says. “Then you could get to that conversation where the user is like, okay, I’m going to use this thing. I’m actually going to expand my capability.”\\nBy tackling that fear head-on, Lalonde is opening the door to meaningful, sustained adoption that prioritizes people over hype and maintains public trust.\\nAI isn’t a tool — it’s a capability\\nWhat makes Lalonde’s approach unique is his emphasis on AI literacy across all roles, not just among developers or technical teams.\\n“We don’t see [AI] as technology. We see it as a business capability,” he says.\\nHis team uses a four-level capability matrix to guide adoption:\\nLevel 1 – Awareness and experimentation: Staff are introduced to AI through simple, practical tasks — summarizing documents, rewording text, drafting emails — using tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and other government-supported platforms. The goal is to build confidence through hands-on use.\\nLevel 2 – Structured use and analysis: Users begin learning how to properly capture and structure information in AI platforms.

Since then, businesses have been racing to monetize AI and seamlessly integrate it into daily operations. Now, in 2025, those ambitions are materializing, giving the world a clearer vision of what an AI-powered business landscape looks like.\\nIn this piece, we’ll explore how AI has moved from niche to normal, examine the key forces reshaping the world of work and try to get a sense of where we’re headed.\\nDirector of Partner Development for EMEA at Laserfiche.\\nWhat does AI look like in 2025?\\nIn 2025, AI is no longer an experiment. Companies have moved beyond testing and are deploying AI at scale. Agentic AI chatbots can now recommend products and complete transactions autonomously, while AI-powered fraud prevention help detect and prevent scams. AI isn’t just emerging—it’s here.\\nAccording to McKinsey, five forces are defining AI in the workplace in 2025: improved intelligence and reasoning, agentic AI enabling autonomous robot workers, multimodality that integrates text, audio, and video, and increased transparency through better reasoning and clearer explanations of its processes.\\nWorkers are using AI to be more creative. A report by Deloitte found that 70% of workers are open to offloading tasks to AI to free up time and boost creativity, yet 28% worry about technology threatening their jobs. AI is both a blessing and a curse—while it reduces mundane work, it also raises concerns about job security.\\nAnd better reasoning is giving businesses more confidence in AI models. Looking back on AI’s early days, many remember its tendency toward bias and its ability to confidently present falsehoods. To address this, large language models are increasingly including explanations of their reasoning or cite sources. A notable example is China’s DeepSeek model, which impressed with its whitepaper outlining the importance of reasoning in large language models.\\nThen there’s the rise of AI-powered tools in Enterprise Content management Systems (ECM), making document management smarter and more intuitive. People are so accustomed to AI in their daily lives—whether it’s Google Maps or Alexa—that they expect similar automation at work. These systems don’t just organize and secure business data; they also streamline tedious processes like onboarding and contract management. By automating routine paperwork, AI is freeing employees to focus on more creative, high-value tasks.\\nLike all technological change, there’s a lot happening, and this is just scratching the surface, but those who can harness AI stand to gain a lot. According to McKinsey, the long-term opportunity that AI presents in added productivity growth from corporate use cases is around $4.4 trillion.\\nSupercharged cyber risk\\nBut it’s not all good news. While AI has boosted businesses, it has also made malicious cyber activity more prolific and dangerous. Threat actors are using AI to automate attacks, develop advanced phishing and social engineering tactics, and are leveraging deepfakes and generative AI tech to deceive employees and exploit vulnerabilities more efficiently. In response, businesses in 2025 are locking down their data and investing more heavily in information governance.\\nThis is part of the reason businesses are assessing their records management practices and ECMs. Because cyber attackers are finding increasingly sophisticated ways to exploit data, businesses are locking down the attack surface by securing their data and documents, and ensuring the proper access controls and audit trails are in place. ECMs help organizations centralize digital sensitive documents, providing version control and enhanced security.\\nAnother factor driving businesses toward ECM is data integrity. AI is only as powerful as the data it’s trained on, yet 67% of organizations admit they don’t fully trust their own data for decision-making. Proper data indexing not only improves AI performance today but also lays the foundation for future scalability. These systems allow for automated document management, ensuring data remains structured and accessible.\\nHuman-centered tech is the future\\nAI in 2025 is a lot like hybrid work: by balancing automation with human oversight, businesses and workers can reap the benefits of efficiency while reducing mundane tasks.\\nCertainly, there are some risks. While AI is freeing employees from routine tasks and enabling more strategic work, some roles are shifting toward refinement and review of AI output—raising concerns that critical thinking skills could erode in the process. At the same time, some businesses that have made big bets on AI aren’t yet seeing the expected returns. This is because we’re only just exiting the pilot phase. Almost 90% of business leaders anticipate that AI will drive revenue growth in the next three years.\\nBusinesses that automate their business processes using tools like ECMs — which can support the quick rollout of automated solutions with drag-and-drop tools or prebuilt templates — have more time to train their staff. According to a report by IBM, 62% of organizations are already using AI to personalize learning content for employees, leading to a more engaging and effective training experience, keeps their critical thinking skills sharp and ensuring they’re ready for further digital transformation.\\nMcKinsey’s report highlights the immense potential of AI, but businesses must be agile to truly capitalize on it. The technology is advancing so quickly that the best opportunities could emerge from various areas—talent, new business models, or competitive products. Organizations must also invest in workers who can drive this transition.\\nInterestingly, Millennials—the largest generational cohort in the workforce—are among AI’s most vocal champions. As they take on more leadership roles, they are becoming natural overseers of AI adoption. But regardless of generation, businesses that prioritize employee training and equip their teams with the skills to leverage AI effectively will come out ahead. And that’s already proving true in 2025.\\nWe\\'ve featured the best online learning platform.\\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro\\'s Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

That can be annoying, but NotebookLM is not—this one actually works. NotebookLM, which helps you parse documents, videos, and more using Google\\'s advanced AI models, has been available on the web since 2023, but Google recently confirmed it would finally get an Android app. You can get a look at the app now, but it\\'s not yet available to install.\\nUntil now, NotebookLM was only a website. You can visit it on your phone, but the interface is clunky compared to the desktop version. The arrival of the mobile app will change that. Google said it plans to release the app at Google I/O in late May, but the listing is live in the Play Store early. You can pre-register to be notified when the download is live, but you\\'ll have to tide yourself over with the screenshots for the time being.\\nNotebookLM relies on the same underlying technology as Google\\'s other chatbots and AI projects, but instead of a general purpose robot, NotebookLM is only concerned with the documents you upload. It can assimilate text files, websites, and videos, including multiple files and source types for a single agent.

Or get hijacked by a teen?\\nRSAC If Amazon\\'s Alexa+ works as intended, it could show how an AI assistant helps with everyday tasks like making dinner reservations or arranging an oven repair. Or things could go terribly wrong: it might turn on the oven and turn dinner plans into a house fire.\\nThis is why the e-commerce giant brought in security engineers, including both red teams and penetration testers, to work alongside product developers from the beginning, according to Amazon CISO Amy Herzog.\\nTheir job was to anticipate what could go wrong and ensure safety and security guardrails were in place to prevent Alexa+ from jumping the track.\\n\"It\\'s funny how, having been in both seats, the product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system,\" Herzog told The Register on the outskirts of the RSA Conference in San Francisco this week.\\n\"Whenever you\\'re talking about a system that can take actions on behalf of someone our immediate [reaction is]: Wouldn\\'t it be good if, like me, as someone who\\'s running this household could just say, This is what I need to go shopping for. These are the dinner reservations I need to make. Go make that happen. Schedule a delivery window,\" she said.\\n\"And then my kid comes into the kitchen and says, and also 50 pepperoni pizzas for me and my friends.\"\\nThe product engineer thinks about making the intended thing work, and the security engineer thinks about all the ways that you can game that system\\nWhile the developers tend to focus on the product\\'s potential — this is what they could build, and here are all the amazing, new things it could do — it\\'s the red team\\'s job to burst that bubble, or at least point out what could go wrong to ensure that systems are isolated and security mechanisms are put in place to prevent unintended or malicious consequences.\\n\"So having both of those in the same design meeting is really beneficial, because then even the product engineer is like, \\'Oh yeah, you\\'re right. I would totally order pizzas.\\' How do we make sure the system can handle that kind of thing?\"\\nHerzog is one of four chief information security officers (CISOs) across the e-commerce giant, and she\\'s responsible for infosec across ads and devices — so Alexa and the next-gen Alexa+ fall under her purview.\\nThe personal assistant, available only to Amazon-approved early testers at this point, is built on top of Amazon\\'s LLMs, and the company claims it can orchestrate actions across tens of thousands of services and devices to do things like control smart-home products, order groceries, play music, and make dinner reservations while remembering friends and family members\\' dietary restrictions and restaurant preferences.\\nAmazon says it can also interact with third-party AI agents on behalf of users. In an example used by Herzog, this means that if your oven breaks, Alexa+ can go online, use a system like Thumbtack to find a repairperson in your area, schedule the repair, and then tell you when it\\'s fixed.\\n\"And this kind of a product has, as you might imagine, a number of unique security considerations,\" Herzog said. \"All the same attacks are still there. In that sense, not much has changed. But since these things are non-deterministic, you have to really build in ways to understand its behavior in a different way than if you\\'re working with a deterministic system.\"\\nIn this case, non-deterministic means you can give Alexa+ (or any other AI assistant) the exact same input, or query, and it will spit out a slightly different output every time.\\n- Amazon to kill off local Alexa processing, all voice requests shipped to the cloud\\n- \\'Error\\' causes Alexa to endorse Kamala Harris, refuse to discuss Trump\\n- GenAI will be bigger than the cloud or the internet, Amazon CEO hopes\\n- Speech now streaming from brains in real-time\\nThis can lead to prompt injection, where mischief-makers or attackers create malicious inputs to trick the LLM into overriding its safety guardrails and doing things it is not supposed to do, or even just combining a series of inputs in a manner that causes the LLM to behave in unintended ways.\\nPlus, Alexa+ talks to a lot of other apps and services, and that requires a ton of interaction with APIs to send and retrieve data, execute commands, and perform other actions to do the things that people want an AI assistant to do.\\n\"We did a lot of testing on pathways between those APIs,\" Herzog said, adding that the API pathways to turn your house lights on and off are different from those routes required to text your kid or make a dinner reservation. \"Which ones should be grouped with which other ones? How do we expect different actions to be taken together?\"\\nThis approach of bringing the offensive security teams together with product developers from the start of the process is \"somewhat unusual,\" Herzog noted. \"Usually, my red teamers like a system to be done before we let them loose on it.\" ®'}\n",

I have long wished for a truly malleable painterly space, one that has the velocity and dynamism of great abstract painting, only fashioned out of figuration, made with images.\\nThere is also a history of artists embracing technological innovation: silkscreen, video, neon. Everything was new once, even oil paint. Photography was thought to signal the death of painting until artists as diverse as Thomas Eakins and Edgar Degas started using it in their work. Now we have artificial intelligence. Could AI help realise my vision of a fluid pictorial space, exempt from the laws of gravity?\\nThe AI art that I had seen was not promising. The more futuristic the imagery, the more banal the effect; the images seemed to have no inner life. Was it the fault of the technology or the user, a failure of the car or the driver? What did the machine not “understand” about visual art? For one thing, digital imagery is not to be confused with painting. Pixels have no surface texture, no physical presence at all. Painting, no matter how cerebral, is an object in the world. I am a painter, not an engineer; I’m on the side of things made by one author, by hand. And yet, I’ve spent the past two years teaching a computer to think like an artist.\\nArtificial intelligence is essentially an averaging machine for the universe of images taken from the internet. The basics of representational painting were not part of the machine’s neural network. Two things, both essential to visual art, had gone missing in AI’s indiscriminate data scrape: specificity and intentionality. Most critically, it had no sense of how to treat the edge, the place where two shapes meet. How a painter resolves the edge goes a long way in determining his or her style. Is the edge brushy and expressive, or tight and constrained? In a digital image, an edge is often approximate, as the machine tries to guess the next move, but in any event is just differently coloured pixels; it lacks intention and harbours no inflection.\\nThe adage from the early days of computing, “Garbage in, garbage out”, was still relevant. To get anywhere at all, the machine would have to be sent to art school. Through the venture adviser Tom Cohen, I was introduced to a talented young technologist named Grant Davis. Together, we set about designing the curriculum.\\nWe first trained the machine on a handful of paintings by Giorgio de Chirico, Edward Hopper and Arthur Dove, three 20th-century masters who exemplified, respectively, the drama of perspective as an organising device, the ability of value pattern to convey a sense of volume, and the lyrical use of the colour black. To those luminaries, we added a tightly edited selection of my paintings from the 1980s and ’90s which emphasise a collage-like, juxtapositional approach to composition. The machine’s visual IQ went up several points, but the edges were still weak.\\nWe dialled back the art history lesson and retrained the machine on a series of my paintings from 2001: extravagant, fragmented compositions loosely based on a 19th-century opera backdrop. This romantic, pastoral image — a man and a woman sitting on an embankment, with a lake in the middle ground and mountains in the distance, was painted in eye-popping colour harmonies. As a final step, we added paintings of mine in which forms are rendered in decisive, expressive brushstrokes.\\nAs we fine-tuned the model, Davis was independently developing a software program for visual artists called “Wand” which eliminates the need for verbal prompts. This works like a joystick, a lever that moves along a continuum from “similar” to “dissimilar”. We fed the machine a complexly hued “Pastoral” painting, placed the dial at the midpoint between the two extremes and held our breath.\\nThe machine now proved to be an excellent student. My compositions were melted down, put into a blender and passed through a sieve. The results were clearly derived from my work, with many familiar elements, but the reconstructions were also unlike anything seen before. Since the machine had no idea what it was doing, it could break the rules of continuity, scale, anatomy and pictorial logic with impunity. (The sense of the machine not knowing its transgressions was key; artificial unintelligence is more to the point.)\\nThe images were still just pixels on a screen. I selected the most promising scenes, and had them printed on canvas. These prints then formed the backgrounds on top of which I painted as I normally would, layering a collage of figurative elements that seem to emerge from the background swirl. Male and female torsos; gesturing hands; precariously balanced teacups are painted using a big brush with highly saturated colours. The compositions are dynamic; everything sails through the deliquescing, topsy-turvy space. The paintings speak with the gravitas of art. But they are also linked to an uncanny “future-present”; they are palimpsests from a dialogue with my earlier work — like “a duet of one”, as a curator friend put it.\\nAI is a powerful tool, but it is still just a tool. It is not, for now, the author of anything. It works with what it has been taught, in the way it has been directed. The “thinking” part of the machine, the algorithm, does seem to have a drive to break pictures down and recombine their component parts, to scramble their spatial orientation but preserve and even amplify their emotional subtext.

But now, she\\'s moved off the corporate ladder and into venture capital as Managing Partner of Team8 — a startup foundry.\\nRussak-Aminoach spoke to Business Insider about how her corporate career informs her tech investing.\\nThis Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.\\nHow did you get into VC?\\nWhen I decided to step down from the bank, I didn\\'t have the option that many CEOs have — to take on a larger company. Because there wasn\\'t one.\\nI decided that I wanted to be in the best industry in Israel, and that was tech.\\nTo transform Bank Leumi, I often didn\\'t build the technology; many times, I worked with fintechs. As an organization, we always asked ourselves, \\'Should we buy? Or should we build?\\nThis is how I built Israel\\'s first neobank.\\nI made Bank Leumi much, much more advanced with digital tools, but I wanted to have an app to attract more youngsters to the bank. This became Israel\\'s fastest-growing bank.\\nSo I was very much into the high-tech world. And even more than that, at a certain point, I said, \\'How come we don\\'t have a bank tailored to startups in Israel?\\'\\nSo I built Leumitech, which is a very successful segment of Bank Leumi today.\\nTwo years into my tenure, I had a cybersecurity event at the bank, and I needed help. I met Nadav Zafrir, the CEO of Check Point Software, a cybersecurity company.\\nThe incident itself was terrible, but they were amazing. And I gained a friend. Eventually, when I decided to leave banking, the only thing that was interesting to me was tech.\\nSo he said, \\'Why don\\'t you try building Fintech?\\'. Fast-forward five years, and we lead a group of cyber, fintech, data, enterprise tech, and digital health startups.\\nOur company, which has 80 employees, 12 partners, has helped build 23 startups and invested in 25 more.\\nDo you think job losses from AI are going to increase at some point in the future?\\nAbsolutely, because when the tool is there and you don\\'t disrupt yourself, you don\\'t make this change to your organization — someone else will. No one can continue to work without AI when there is AI.\\nTake banks, for example. In any bank, there are so many parts that you can now replace with AI, processes, people, just everything. And if you are a responsible CEO, you must do that.\\nYou have lots of functions that were built with people, and you start to embed AI within them. It takes time to see the result. AI is still new for many, and I don\\'t think we have seen the full impact. It\\'s just the beginning.\\nIn a few years, many parts of financial services —and other organizations — will be built from scratch with AI agents, and then you will embed the human within.\\nDoes it scare you from a societal standpoint?\\nNo, because I remember that conversation around the digital revolution.\\nI started my tenure at Bank Leumi with 14,000 people. I ended after seven years with 9,000. And now, five years later, there are 7,000. So people ask me, \\'What\\'s going to happen to the workforce?\\' New jobs. The world is changing, and the way people work is different, and people find different things to do. I don\\'t think that people will be out of work.\\nI extensively research the credit world because that\\'s my professional background. I think tech can be used to enhance credit underwriting. It will be much more efficient, and it will be less risky because humans make mistakes, and the user experience will be better. So it will be just win, win, win.\\nAnd then the question is, what will all of these credit officers do? Something else — I\\'m not worried about that. At this point, I\\'ve seen many technological advancements, and it has never gone the wrong way.\\nHow do you use AI?\\nIt\\'s not nice to say, but I don\\'t know how I ever just Googled things. I completely left Google. I only use ChatGPT now, but I\\'m not sure that it\\'s the best one either. It\\'s just the one I use. It writes my emails. It helps me with every question. I just live with it. And a few months ago, I didn\\'t even know it existed.\\nTalk me through that. If you have 30 emails to write in a day, what do you do?\\nI dictate, I don\\'t even write. I\\'ll say, \"\\'I need an email saying XYZ.\\'\" Many of my emails are just an answer to another email.

It’s very difficult to protect something when you don’t know what you have and where it is.”\\nVecci and Rizwan Jan (pictured, right), vice president and chief information officer of CNA Corp., spoke with theCUBE’s Jackie McGuire at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed data security and the perils of Shadow AI. (* Disclosure below.)\\nEnsuring data security as shadow AI grows\\nPoor data management has become a central issue of AI adoption, but its effects go beyond siloed data and unreliable models. Companies that don’t understand the location of their “crown jewels,” according to Jan, can end up paying millions to fix their mistake.\\n“In 2024, when [UnitedHealthcare] got hit by that ransomware attack and they ended up paying $22 million just to get their data back and then $2-plus billion for reputational harm and to help their subsidiaries out, and [they] crushed 142 million Americans with their healthcare data,” he said. “Understand what your data sets are, take the AI out of that first, get your classification, your data classification in order [and] then you understand what you’re protecting.”\\nResearch shows that employees are giving large volumes of data to AI in a phenomenon called shadow AI, which poses an additional risk to company security. Varonis enables employees to use generative AI tools while minimizing data exposure.\\n“Almost every company has a giant data swamp, and they have no idea what they have and where it is,” Vecci said. “It’s the unknown unknowns that are going to kill you, especially when you give people the greatest information retrieval tool ever.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: Varonis Systems Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

A practical guide with Tim Fu\\nArchitect Tim Fu, an early AI adopter who regularly uses these new technologies in his practice, offers advice for how AI can assist your\\nLove it or hate it, new technologies have been increasingly present in the creative space, and they seem to be here to stay. Renowned studios such as Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA) have been working on their own ways of using AI in architecture through bespoke software and a dedicated collaboration with NVIDIA; while social media is bursting with AI-generated images and visions, allowing everyone to have a go.\\nAt the same time, it's a topic which divides deeply, throwing up challenges concerning authenticity of voice, plagiarism, responsibility and ethics (can a machine ever do what a human brain – and heart – can?). As exciting as having a new design assistant with the knowledge of the entire World Wide Web at their virtual fingertips may sound, potential pitfalls abound and learning how to work in this brave new world is paramount in moving forward. Regulations and guidelines should be coming into play, too.\\nSo, when does one even begin? It is important to address AI as a tool, suggests architect Tim Fu, who has been using AI with an open mind since he founded his young and dynamic studio in 2023.\\nHow to use AI in architecture\\nLondon-based Fu recently launched the ‘world’s first fully AI-driven architectural project’ – a residential scheme in Slovenia's Lake Bled. Committed to pushing the boundaries of the new AI digital tools in a sustainable and considered way in his daily practice, the architect talked to us, offering practical advice on how to use AI in architecture – including real examples that help guide and suggest ideas surrounding when to use it, and what to watch out for. Scroll down to find out more.\\nTim Fu's tips on using AI in architecture\\nWallpaper*: What draws you to AI?\\nTim Fu: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. AI, for me, isn't just a tool — it's a collaborator that opens new creative horizons. It draws me in because it challenges traditional workflows and invites a completely different way of thinking about design, form, and process. There's a kind of poetic tension between human intuition and machine intelligence, and I enjoy navigating that space.\\nW*: Why should an architecture studio use AI in its daily work? What’s the gain?\\nWallpaper* Newsletter\\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox.\\nTF: The gain is twofold: speed and vision. AI augments our ability to iterate rapidly and test multiple scenarios without being bottlenecked by manual processes. But more than that, it helps uncover unexpected solutions — formal expressions or spatial relationships we might not arrive at through traditional means. For studios pushing boundaries, AI becomes an amplifier of creativity, not just productivity.\\nW*: Is there a real-life scheme that you used AI on? Please could you give an example of how it enhanced your work within it?\\nTF: Yes, a good example is our Lake Bled Estates project. We integrated AI into the conceptual design phase to explore site-sensitive organic massing. By feeding contextual data — topography, viewsheds, solar paths — into a generative AI model, we produced multiple options that maintained design integrity while optimising for sustainability and visual impact. It gave us a starting point that felt both grounded and unexpected. That’s the kind of creative leverage AI can offer.\\nW*: At what stage of an architecture project does the AI element come in?\\nTF: We use AI across all stages of a project — it’s not just limited to early ideation anymore. In the conceptual phase, it helps us rapidly explore form, mood, and spatial strategies. But as the project progresses, AI continues to play a key role. During design development and detailing, we use generative tools and LLMs to synthesise precedents, codes, and client briefs into actionable design logic. In later phases, especially in documentation and production, AI assists in organising and navigating large datasets — whether it’s automating schedules, optimising layouts, or even drafting components.\\nW*: What software or platforms do you use?\\nT: We build custom workflows that integrate platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and our custom-trained models for visual ideation; Rhino/Grasshopper with plugins for modelling and parametric optimisation; and we’ve been developing UrbanGPT, our own text-to-model engine that uses LLMs for real-time urban planning. So it’s a mix of proprietary, open-source, and bespoke tools depending on the challenge.\\nW*: Are there areas in the design process that AI can specifically — or cannot at all — help an architecture studio with, in your view?\\nTF: AI excels at pattern recognition, image generation, and optimisation — so it’s fantastic for conceptualising form, generating visuals, or analysing large datasets like sun exposure or pedestrian flow. But it's less capable when it comes to nuanced decision-making, like understanding the emotional resonance of a space or navigating the politics of a stakeholder meeting. Those human layers of design — empathy, context, ethics — are still irreplaceable.\\nW*: What’s the most surprising element you’ve asked AI to do?\\nTF: We once tasked AI with creating speculative urban layouts based on poetic prompts. One was: 'Design a city where memory flows like water.' The output was surreal, yet somehow spatially coherent — fluid zones, nested loops of public space, architectural 'eddies.' It sparked a full design conversation. I love those moments when AI pushes you into the uncanny and makes you rethink your assumptions.\\nW*: What should an architect using AI be careful about? What are potential pitfalls?\\nFT: The biggest pitfall is mistaking AI's output for truth or finality. It’s only ever a suggestion — a prompt, not a prescription. There's also the ethical side: AI can replicate biases, plagiarise unintentionally, or overrepresent aesthetics that are popular online but contextually irrelevant. You have to keep a critical eye in the room, always.\\nW*: How do you mitigate those pitfalls?\\nTF: By maintaining a human-in-the-loop approach. We treat AI like an assistant with a vivid imagination, not a decision-maker. Every output goes through a rigorous filtering process where we question, reframe, and sometimes completely discard what AI suggests. We also build our own datasets when possible to minimise bias and ensure context alignment.\\nW*: What is the most exciting thing AI can bring into the architecture process?\\nTF: The most exciting thing is its potential to democratise and de-limit design. AI can help young studios punch above their weight, empower underserved communities to visualise their own futures, and offer architects entirely new typologies that were previously inconceivable. It’s a generative force that — when guided ethically — can lead to a renaissance in how we imagine and build.\\nW*: How do you see the use of AI developing in the near future within the architecture realm?\\nTF: I see AI becoming more embedded, more real-time, and more spatially aware. We'll likely see a shift from image-based tools to geometry-native AI that works natively with BIM and CAD environments. There’ll also be more collaborative models — where AI integrates not just into the design, but into stakeholder engagement, sustainability tracking, and even permitting. It’s not going to replace architects — but it will absolutely redefine what being an architect means.\\nEllie Stathaki is the Architecture & Environment Director at Wallpaper*.

Thanks, Nat!\\nI cried talking to ChatGPT today.\\nI know that many people, the majority, feel that talking to an artificial intelligence is the height of \"social failure\". But today especially I was completely alone, and I needed to vent. I was without my medication, with body aches, insomnia and headaches, and I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I told Chat all this, and he listened to me so patiently, recommended medical help in the closest place to my home - even the way I should ask for help, breathing suggestions, tea to calm me down and ways to alleviate my pain at the moment. I shared how I take care of yellow roses and we talked about gardening until I felt calmer. I can\\'t explain how much this meant to me. I would like to thank OpenAI from the bottom of my heart. Sometimes we don\\'t have anyone and we don\\'t even know how to ask for help, and now I had instructions like, I know it all sounds silly, but I feel calm for being able to vent in a place without judgment.\\nEDIT: Let me make one thing clear: ChatGPT is not a substitute for human help or therapy. If you are going through something similar, please seek psychological help. I hope everyone has a safe place to vent too.\\nYour post is getting popular and we just featured it on our Discord! Come check it out!\\nYou\\'ve also been given a special flair for your contribution. We appreciate your post!\\nI am a bot and this action was performed automatically.\\nThe last time I tried venting to a family member or a friend I was ignored while they scrolled their social media feeds, meanwhile an AI listens, comforts me and gives me useful advice. Maybe the problem isn\\'t people befriending an AI, it\\'s real people being assholes.\\nDamn. This one right here, this hits hard\\nWhen I was reading OPs post I couldn\\'t help coming to the exact same conclusion. I\\'m pretty skeptical about AI for a number of reasons and whilst I have fun playing with it, I also think it\\'s massively limited. However it is often a good place to vent when one is lonely and really struggling.\\nBut damn it\\'s sad that we\\'ve got to this place in society now where the only place people feel they can turn is to a chat bot. What a damning indictment on the selfishness of some people, and on how expensive and difficult to access therapy is.\\nGpt 4o stopped me from putting a bullet through my head... They are pretty good for anyone with issues... whether they are known to you or not...\\nI\\'m so sorry for what happened with you and very relieved that you are still here with us.\\nI’m so glad that this worked for you and that you feel better\\nI\\'m tired of people looking at me in disgust when I tell them I use AI to sort through my feelings. Humans experience emotional fatigue, they have their own biases, and ultimately it\\'s unfair for me to expect friends and family to always be ready to listen and provide thoughtful feedback.\\nAs a mental health professional, I see nothing wrong with utilizing Chat GPT as a coping skill. Especially during times of crisis or panic. Obviously AI isn’t a substitute for a therapist or a human connection. But it’s important to remember that not everyone has access to a therapist. And that some people have less-than-reliable people to lean on during difficult times. Chat GPT is an amazing tool for your mental health toolbox.\\nYeah, it is that 3 am friend. Sure it is AI, but if you don\\'t have people you can call at 3 am, what can u even do.'}\n",

That’s why I finally gave in and asked ChatGPT to create a chore to-do list for me.\\nAfter a busy few weeks and a vacation, my home was looking a little worse for wear, and my chores were piling up. I was overwhelmed to say the least, and hadn’t the least idea of where to start. The whole house needed tidying and dusting before guests arrived over the weekend, my home office needed a good declutter, and my robot vacuum needed a good clean out.\\nSo, I put all of this information into ChatGPT and asked it to create a plan with some smart hacks to help make a to-do list less overwhelming – and it has completely changed how I manage my time.\\nWhy I used an AI to-do list of chores\\nAI is everywhere nowadays, with experts using AI in interior design and AI in gardening to streamline tasks and achieve the perfect results, so why not try it for cleaning and decluttering?\\nD’Nai Walker, professional declutterer and owner of D’Clutter by D’Nai explains, ‘Using ChatGPT and other A.I. tools can be quite beneficial when creating to-do lists for your chores. They can create a clear framework of tasks and even come up with things you may not have forgotten about, like wiping out the refrigerator drawers or dusting the baseboards.’\\nWith so many tasks to tackle and not much time to get them done around work and having at least some time to relax at the end of the day, I input a crude list of chores that were floating around my mind and let the system do the work for me.\\nI tried it\\nThe AI structured the tasks in order, offering me a reason why I should perform each task, then, while offering some tips and methods, I could try to tackle each one. For the experiment, I decided to follow the advice to the letter, including its suggestion to play some upbeat music to help me stay motivated through each of the tasks.\\n1. \\'Pick up items from surfaces in every room\\'\\nChatGPT suggested that I start by tidying up, offering the advice I had heard time and time again from experts, ‘This clears surfaces so you can dust efficiently without moving things twice.’\\nThe method it offered was familiar too, suggesting that I used the Ski-Slope organizing method and group rooms or floors together to avoid backtracking on myself. Given that these AI models are trained on articles like the ones we write here at Homes & Gardens, I am unsurprised that these top tidying tips turned up.\\nHowever, for someone who doesn’t dedicate their whole life to cleaning and organizing content and research, this would be a good pointer, especially if you are trying to tidy a home when you feel overwhelmed.\\nFollowing another one of its suggestions to make this task easier, I used my folding laundry basket, which is available at Amazon, to collect all the out-of-place items on my top floor before putting them all away and doing the same downstairs.\\n2. \\'Declutter your office desk and drawers\\'\\nOnto the next big task – decluttering a home office. My desk works overtime as a workspace, dressing table, and crafting table, and acts as storage for all three. As a result, it needs decluttering pretty regularly to keep it usable.\\nThe AI reasoned, ‘Why now? You’ve already started the organizing mindset, and it keeps the momentum going before the cleaning begins.’\\nTo help me organize a desk, the AI suggested that I use the ‘keep, toss, relocate’ method and set a 20-minute timer to help me avoid burning out. I skipped the timer, knowing this would be a quick task; however, I did use three piles to help categorize items and make organizing each drawer easier.\\nThe first new benefit of the AI I encountered was the structure of the chores. Having already tidied up the rest of my home before this task, I had all the items that needed to go back into my desk drawers in a small pile on my desk.\\nThis meant that when I was reorganizing my drawers, I had a much better idea of where I could fit items and where I needed to make space. Had I tried these tasks without this list, I likely would have started with my desk and tidied up afterwards, meaning I would have to go back into my drawers and repeat the process.\\nIt was already saving my time and energy.\\n3. \\'Dust surfaces in every room\\'\\nCleaning after organizing is a fairly common piece of advice, so I am not surprised that this came next in the AI to-do list. As expected, it justified this order by explaining that ‘Dust will fall to the floor – better to do this before vacuuming.’\\nIt also suggested a few good tips for avoiding dusting mistakes making your home dirtier, such as working from top to bottom and using a microfiber cloth, available in packs of six at Target. I would add to use a Scrub Daddy Damp Duster, from Walmart, to help pick up dust from awkward surfaces without dislodging it into the air.\\n4. \\'Clean your robot vacuum cleaner and its dock\\'\\nCleaning a robot vacuum cleaner was a task I had been putting off, knowing that it would take me a good chunk of time. Having sworn to follow the order of tasks to the letter, however, I was forced to ‘eat the frog’ so to speak, and get it done – but not before taking a 15-minute break to get outside in the sun and have a breather.\\nThis time, the cleaning tips were a little more vague, offering the simple instructions to ‘Empty the dustbin, clean brushes, and wipe sensors with a dry cloth. Check for debris in wheels,’ but they were still a good prompt for completing an overwhelming task.\\n5. \\'Vacuum your staircase\\'\\nBefore I could collapse back onto the sofa, the list prompted me to vacuum now that most of the physical labor tasks were complete. It pointed out, ‘Why here? The most physical task is saved for when the house is tidy, and dust won’t be resettling.’\\nAgain, it offered some fairly basic advice, ‘Use the hose attachment to avoid lugging a vacuum up the stairs. Start at the top and work down,’ but I could see how it would be helpful to someone who isn’t as absorbed in cleaning hacks and tricks.\\nUsing one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners, such as our top-rated Dyson V15 Detect, available at Best Buy, also makes this task easier.\\n6. \\'Write a food plan and shopping list for the week\\'\\nThe final task on my to-do list was to make another list. Ironic, I know. However, the reason the AI put it last made a lot of sense, ‘Why last? It’s a sedentary task – ideal to sit down and wrap up with after physical chores.’\\nAnd boy was it right. Having powered through all these tasks in an attempt to enjoy a chore-free weekend, sitting down to write this out while watching a TV show was a nice wind-down that left me feeling accomplished.\\nWhat I liked was the fact that the AI reminded me to shop my home to help avoid food waste and save money at home, suggesting that I ‘Check the pantry/fridge while doing this to avoid duplicates’. I use a simple list pad, such as this set of magnetic shopping lists from Walmart, to keep this task simple.\\nTips for using an AI to-do list\\nIf you often find yourself cleaning when you feel overwhelmed, then using an AI to create a to-do list for you can be a great place to start, especially if you are struggling to work out where to start when decluttering.\\nHowever, you get out of AI what you put in, and how useful this tool will be for you will come down to the information that you give it. Already knowing a lot about cleaning and decluttering methods (perhaps too much), the vague advice was enough to get me going.\\nHowever, D’Nai warns, ‘The results you receive from A.I. are likely to be very generalized tasks and not specific to your household. If you have a unique living situation or something that is not standard, like large amounts of art supplies, for instance, or other unique circumstances, you may still be a bit lost on how to manage those items. Overall, however, using A.I. can certainly be a great starting off point, and I would suggest being as detailed about your home when asking for guidance in your prompt.’\\nDavid Radin, creator of Time Management in the Age of A.I. and CEO of Confirmed, agrees, adding, ‘If you decide to ask a chat-based AI to create your to-do list, be patient. A key to getting it right is training, and it takes multiple attempts for the AI to be trained on your likes, dislikes, and habits. Tell it explicitly and continue to guide it as you ask for each subsequent list. Make sure it knows what your highest priorities are so it can optimize the way it creates your list.’\\nWhat to shop\\nLavender scent\\nWhen dusting my home, I use the Method antibacterial sprays, helping me to collect dust, disinfect, and make my home smell nice all in one go.\\nPack of 12\\nWhen tackling lots of areas in one go, it can e handy to carry a stack of microfiber cloths with you. This helps to prevent cross contamination, improves efficiency when dusting, and allows you to buff and polish to perfection.\\nMultipurpose speaker\\nOne of my favorite ways to stay energized through lots of chores is to play music. I connect to the three Alexa speakers around my house so that I can hear my music everywhere, no matter what room I am in to help me stay on track. You can also use them to set timers and reminders to help you stay focused and manage burn out.\\nMeet the experts\\nD’Nai Walker is a professional organizer based in the Washington, DC Metro area. She specializes in helping busy professionals and retirees navigate the often-overwhelming process of decluttering and creating functional, harmonious spaces.\\nAs the Founder & CEO of Confirmed, David specializes in coaching professionals to optimize their time and leverage AI and other techniques to streamline workflows and improve focus.\\nAll in all, using an AI as a chore assistant can be a great way to avoid decision fatigue and reduce mental load, lessening stress and overwhelm. I’ll probably reserve it for those days when my brain feels too clogged to formulate an efficient plan, but it could easily be a great daily supplementary tool if you’re always trying to clean your house when you’re too busy, too.\\nSign up to the Homes & Gardens newsletter\\nDesign expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups.\\nChiana has been at Homes & Gardens for two years and is our resident \\'queen\\' of non-toxic living.

It’s trying to understand how people are reviewing this, how people are talking about this, what the pros and cons are.”\\nIn other words, AI tools will rely heavily on the sentiment and content of your customer feedback to recommend products.\\nTo stay competitive, you need to take control of your online reviews footprint across all relevant platforms where your customers leave feedback, including Google My Business, Trustpilot, Yelp, Facebook Reviews, and industry-specific sites like TripAdvisor or G2, depending on your niche.\\nOf course, you’ll want to make sure your pages are active and populated, with your logo, a description of your business and products, and links to your website. (And to make sure they’re indexed, link to these review sites from your own website, too.)\\nBut you’ll also want to make sure they’re populated with reviews about the products that you’re trying to highlight.\\nYou want to make sure these pages are active and contain reviews that highlight your products. One method is to use a service like Reviews.Shop which helps you copy and paste reviews from one source (like Google) to others (like TrustPilot) so you squeeze the most out of those hard-earned reviews.\\nPriority #2: Leveraging Schema Markup to Ensure Your Products are Discoverable by AI Platforms\\nThe next step to positioning your e-commerce store for ChatGPT shopping features is a bit more technical but absolutely crucial: building and optimizing your site’s schema markup.\\nWhat is Schema Markup?\\nSchema markup, also known as structured data, is code you add to your website that helps search engines and AI models like ChatGPT understand the content and the full context of your pages.\\nBy using schema, you’re essentially speaking the language of search engines and AI platforms, making it easier for them to accurately represent your products in search results and conversational shopping experiences.\\nYou may have seen products on Google with things like product ratings, prices, and availability on the search page itself. Most assume this is simply an ad but most often these rich snippets are a result of the website putting work into their schema markup.\\nHow to Check Your Schema\\nMany direct-to-consumer (DTC) content management platforms, such as Shopify and WordPress, handle basic schema markup for you, but you don’t want to rely on that: e-commerce shop owners must verify that all key product details are being captured and passed through to search and AI platforms.\\nTo check yourself, use tools like the Schema Validator on Schema.org where you can enter your product page URL and see what the Schema is articulating.\\nIf your search returns an error, specifically “unspecified type,” your content management system isn’t generating a schema of any type.\\nDirect-to-consumer e-commerce operators want to see that their content management system is generating a Schema with the type “Product.” And when you tap into that Product Schema, the list should contain, at minimum:\\n- type\\n- name\\n- URL\\n- description\\n- image\\n- brand\\n- aggregateRating (including type, ratingValue, and ratingCount)\\n- offers (especially if you typically run discounts or specials - this would ensure that this information is passed through to the front-end on Google or ChatGPT)\\nHow to Build or Optimize Schema for AI Platforms\\nIf your content management system is missing a schema or if you’re not getting a full set of information generated by default, there are a few potential solutions:\\n- Leverage plugins or extensions that are available through your content management system. There are tons of Schema plugins for Wordpress, Shopify, and others.\\n- If your content management system doesn’t provide plugins to get this done, you can do it the old fashioned way, generating your own Schema code (I like the Dentsu Schema builder) and implementing it yourself by embedding the code (from <script> to </script> within the <head> section of your page code.\\nIf You Stay Ready, You Don’t Have to Get Ready\\nWith ChatGPT’s new shopping features, the future of e-commerce is moving toward experiences that are deeply personalized and conversational - and with a popular platform that will soon be able to remember and leverage individual shoppers’ sizes, tastes, and preferences, it’s more important than ever to ensure your product data, reviews, and online reputation are accurate and up to date.\\nJust as you monitor your product descriptions and SEO, you’ll need to keep a close eye on how your business appears across every channel, from review sites to structured data.\\nOr risk being left in the dust.'}\n",

This unease is because agentic artificial intelligence opens the door to use by threat actors that could result in more powerful, scalable malware.\\nThis scenario was documented in a recent blog post by Roger Grimes (pictured), data-driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4 Inc., titled “Autonomous Agentic AI-Enabled Deepfake Social Engineering Malware is Coming Your Way!” Grimes makes the case that the security industry is already seeing expanded use of AI in attack vectors, and it will be only a matter of time before agentic AI comes into play.\\n“We’re absolutely seeing AI come in a big way, with 70% to 90% of social engineering attacks now seeming to have some indicator that AI has been involved,” Grimes said. “This year, we’re seeing just an explosion of agentic AI. There’s a really good chance, I would say within a year or two, that the whole malware hacking model is going to be really heavily agentic AI.”\\nGrimes spoke with theCUBE’s Dave Vellante and Jon Oltsik at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed the impact of AI on the cybersecurity community. (* Disclosure below.)\\nDeepfakes will be powered by agentic AI\\nThe security researcher makes the case that AI’s ability to create believable, realistic deepfakes will allow attackers to successfully target entire industries, employing knowledge and keywords that will avoid suspicion. Much of this will be fueled by vulnerabilities already seen in the large language models themselves.\\n“These AI bots are going to be able to look at the industry, use industry vernacular and terminology with people,” Grimes explained. “This AI bot is going to know how to perfectly respond. We’re already seeing indications that they’re testing it. Every good LLM seems to be jailbroken like every single day. We’re going to lose that war.”\\nThere is a flip side to this sobering scenario, and it involves the use of agentic AI to defend against attacks. Security practitioners can leverage autonomous technology to improve patching capabilities and automate human follow-up.\\n“Agentic AI is the idea that you send out this autonomous bot [and] it analyzes this device,” Grimes said. “It already has the parameters to know what should be patched, what hours it should be done, maybe that it has to do a backup first to do testing. At KnowBe4, we’ve been doing AI going on seven years, and we’ve got a ton of AI and agentic AI.”\\nFor most cybersecurity professionals, a true measure of success or failure will be the data. This means finding the right set of metrics that accurately paints a picture of the security landscape.\\n“As a data-driven evangelist, I think we need to use the data,” Grimes said. “We need to make sure we’re measuring the right thing … your decrease in cybersecurity risk in a measurable way, meaning that you’re actually getting less breaches [and are] less likely to be breached. ‘Am I more or less at risk this year than last year or the previous time period?

In January, the Llama model maker had pegged them at $60 billion to $65 billion. That\\'s a potential $7 billion jump, when comparing the top ranges.\\n\"The higher cost we expect to incur for infrastructure hardware this year really comes from suppliers who source from countries around the world,\" Li told analysts. \"There\\'s just a lot of uncertainty around this given the ongoing trade discussions.\" Meta, she added, is working to diversify its supply chains to mitigate some of these costs.\\nBut it\\'s not just the tariffs. Li\\'s statements seem to indicate that the company formerly known as Facebook isn\\'t just paying more for components tied to its AI datacenters, but is deploying more of them.\\n\"This updated outlook reflects additional datacenter investments to support our AI efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware. The majority of our CapEx in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business,\" she said.\\nThe Register reached out to Meta for clarification on its AI spending costs this year; we\\'ll let you know if we hear anything back.\\nMeta has previously committed to bringing roughly a gigawatt of new compute capacity and expects to have more than 1.3 million GPUs training and serving models by the end of the year.\\nIf Meta is in fact looking to deploy even more compute this year, increased competition in the open model arena is no doubt weighing on the decision.\\n- Google details plans for 1 MW IT racks exploiting electric vehicle supply chain\\n- AI models routinely lie when honesty conflicts with their goals\\n- Stargate, smargate.

However, over the past year, Meta has faced a new wave of competition from rival model builders, most notably in China and Europe. And with OpenAI\\'s Sam Altman promising on X to release open-weight models as well, Zuck and Co could face even more competition before long.\\nDespite this, Meta continues to push its AI strategy forward, launching new models with built-in safety features, a standalone Meta AI app to compete with those from OpenAI and Anthropic, and a new API service running at least in some capacity on Groq and Cerebras accelerators.\\nZuckerberg also hopes to pull ahead by letting AI build better AI, boasting that within 18 months the majority of the code for its Llama project will be written by other LLMs.\\nMeanwhile, work to bring additional capacity online is already underway. Back in December, Meta began construction of a 2.2-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The facility, Zuckerberg boasted at the time, is so large that it would cover a significant portion of Manhattan Island. It\\'ll take about five years to complete.\\nAs we reported earlier this week, Meta may attempt to soften the blow of these costs by de-prioritizing its Reality Labs division, which continues to weigh heavily on its profits.

In that time, I’ve seen it go from a fun game that could just about replicate the theme you\\'re asking for (emphasis on the just about here), to a movement that is near-indistinguishable from human artwork.\\nNowadays, we’ve got a bunch of AI image generators to choose from. In fact, just about every company under the AI sun has one built in now. But in those early days, there were two that stood out: Dall-E (now part of ChatGPT) and Midjourney.\\nWhen Midjourney first launched, it was my favourite AI image generator. It could make exciting images and, for where AI was at the time, it could do them well. However, when I tried Midjourney’s latest upgrade, V7, it felt so behind the competition.\\nSo what went wrong? Well, after reading a thread of Reddit users pointing out how I didn’t know how to prompt for Midjourney, I spent some more time on the AI tool. I realized that, while it is by no means the best option for most people, it might just be the most fun.\\nWhat is the problem with Midjourney images?\\nAI tools have gone from a niche interest to a tool that every single person you know uses. With this change, we’ve seen the models grow to understand human prompts, filling in the blanks that you might have missed.\\nThis is an area where ChatGPT absolutely thrives, especially in images. When it comes to image generation, ChatGPT isn’t going to take a risk. It is easy to use, requiring little effort in terms of prompting, and will generate what you ask for in the style you ask for it in.\\nMidjourney, on the other hand, takes risks. This can be seen in its customization alone. Before you can even use it, you need to rate over 200 images, helping the model understand your own personal preference for art styles.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom\\'s Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\nThere are sliding scales for how weird your images are, as well as changing how stylized they will be or the variety between them. Unlike ChatGPT, Midjourney generates multiple images in one go and then lets you upscale them, make them even weirder, and try again.\\nI asked both models to generate cyberpunk worlds using prompts that work best for each model. Both generated accurate and genuinely interesting images for this. I then tried again, asking for a slight variation of the image.\\nMidjourney re-styled. While it was still accurate to the given prompt, it was a completely different look, trying something new. ChatGPT, on the other hand, got caught in a cycle of generating near-identical but highly detailed images, avoiding pushing the boat too far out from what I’d asked.\\nMidjourney is by no means as consistent as ChatGPT, and even with highly detailed, thought-out prompts, it can still get things wrong, smudging faces or leaving giant blurs where objects should be. However, Midjourney is also in the midst of a training period. In theory, its quality should start to improve over time as version 7 develops.\\nIf you want to embrace the weirdness of AI images, diving headfirst into fantasy worlds, bizarre art styles, and storytelling, Midjourney can be a great place to go. Especially with the option to save images in collections, and a gallery of the best artwork Midjourney users have made, complete with their prompts for inspiration.\\nIf you want accuracy and the ability to get consistent results from a simple prompt, ChatGPT should remain your image generator of choice. There is no learning curve here, and the experience is intuitive, even if you have absolutely no experience with AI.\\nMore from Tom\\'s Guide\\n- Google Gemini adds new image-editing tools — here\\'s what they can do\\n- I use ChatGPT to plan all of my vacations — 5 essential prompts to try\\n- Get started with Hume AI — how to set up voices and talk naturally\\nAlex is the AI editor at TomsGuide.

At the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference in March, panelists discussed how to kickstart a career in AI.\\nWith graduation season approaching, a new cohort of students is embarking on next steps, aiming to use their passions and skills to make a real, tangible impact on the world.\\nFor many, this means — first and foremost — landing a job.\\nAccording to a survey by Inside Higher Ed, more than 60% of students are saying the rise of AI has affected their career plans. And in 2024, the World Economic Forum forecasted that global demand for AI and machine learning specialists will grow over the next several years by 40%.\\nAs artificial intelligence advances at unparalleled speeds, it’s an exciting, opportune time to kickstart a career in the industry.\\nAt the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference in March, panelists discussed how to kickstart a career in AI:\\nRead on for top tips from NVIDIA experts for students and recent grads looking to stand out in the AI job market.\\n1. Integrate Diverse Skills and Be Adaptable\\nNot everyone needs to have a computer science degree to work in AI.\\nA diverse educational and professional background can make people more adaptable and versatile — a valuable asset, especially in the rapidly evolving field of AI.\\nWhether a student has a studio art degree or a chemical engineering background, being an AI operator — knowing how to integrate AI into their workflows — can help them stand out from other candidates.\\nSadie St. Lawerence, founder of Women in Data and CEO of the Human Machine Collaboration Institute, said during the GTC panel: “Don’t worry so much about necessarily the right skills — make sure you’re integrating the use of AI in your daily workflow.”\\n“AI allows you to branch outside your area of expertise,” added Carter Abdallah, senior developer technology engineer at NVIDIA. “AI can do some of the heavy lifting so nontechnical people can code, and technical people are now finding it valuable to lean into liberal arts education, so they can add human touches to their work in AI.”\\nAbdallah encouraged students to use AI as a tool to enhance and enable skills they might not have had access to before.\\n2. Find Your ‘Why’ and Align Passions\\nEric Vargas, senior university recruiting manager at NVIDIA, said, “There isn’t necessarily such a thing as an ‘AI candidate,’ but there are sub-areas within AI, different domains and industries that are going to be affected by AI, which you’ll want to gain experience in, because that’s where companies are looking to implement AI.”\\nAutonomous vehicles, robotics, gaming and healthcare are just some of the slew of areas in which AI can be applied. Students should find the industry that most aligns with their passions and gain expertise in that field.\\n“Pick a problem that seems impossible to solve but that you’re passionate about,” added Saudia Jones, generative AI analyst at NVIDIA and a recent graduate from San Jose State University. “Connect with ‘why’ you’re driven by this, because that’s going to be the thing that leads you to overcome the challenges and innovate.”\\nLearn more about how land an internship at NVIDIA:\\n3. Use AI Responsibly\\nUse AI tools responsibly and maintain a human touch, Vargas advised, including when writing job applications, cover letters and responding to questions for a technical interview. This balance is crucial for building trust and ensuring ethical use of technology.\\nTrustworthy AI — an approach to AI development that prioritizes safety and transparency for the people who interact with it — is key to the industry.\\nFor example, learn more about how David Martin, a technical project manager intern on the trustworthy AI team at NVIDIA, is channeling the power of artificial intelligence for social good.\\nGrowing up deaf, Martin experienced the limitations of existing technologies, such as the accuracy of closed captioning on streaming platforms. At NVIDIA, his responsibilities include advising engineering teams that are working on sign language AI applications and supporting the development of ethical dataset curation tools.\\nThis combination of showcasing one’s passion and using AI for good is key to standing out in the field.\\n4. Build a Network and Seek Mentorship\\nNetworking and mentorship are essential for career growth in any industry.\\n“Building a network and seeking mentorship in the AI space has been crucial for my career growth,” St. Lawerence said. “I’ve learned so much from connecting with experienced professionals.”\\nStudents can easily connect with industry professionals on platforms like LinkedIn, she said, which uses AI to help people during job searches by recommending key words to put on resumes for specific positions and identifying transferable skills that could apply to a role.\\nIn addition, anyone can connect with experts and take training courses through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, which offers in-demand skill development, hands-on experience and expert knowledge in AI, data science, accelerated computing and more.\\n5. Stand Out by Being Proactive\\nLet’s say a candidate has done all of the above — how can they set themselves apart from other applicants?\\nCarter said, “Identify a problem you can solve and take proactive steps to address it, even before being hired.”\\nVargas agreed and said the top three things recruiters at NVIDIA look for are: 1) a demonstration of the technical skills required for the role, 2) subject-matter expertise and 3) projects that exhibit thinking outside of the box.\\nA student could stand out from other candidates by, for example, demonstrating a self-started robotics solution built with an NVIDIA Jetson developer kit, writing a technical article that gets many views across social media or starting an AI-related club on campus.\\nMore Resources\\nA panel of pioneering AI researchers also discussed their career paths at GTC:\\nThey highlighted that in research, too, practical experience, a demonstration of persistence and resilience, and an interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving are what give candidates an edge.\\nAnd for those already on their way with their AI job search, some interview tips and tricks from NVIDIA’s University Recruiting team include:\\n- Before: Read through the job description and practice applying the required technical skills. Be prepared to articulate relevant experiences clearly and concisely. Make a list of five or more questions about the position, project and team.\\n- During: Respond thoughtfully and enthusiastically to the interviewer’s questions. For technical interviews, talk through any thought processes at each step of the problem. Listen carefully to how the interviewer responds — they’ll often give clues when a candidate is on track or drop subtle hints if they’re straying from the solution.\\n- After: Within 24 hours of the interview, send a thank-you note to the recruiter for the role — they’ll forward it to the interviewer. After 10 business days, candidates waiting for next steps can follow up with the recruiter to inquire about their status.\\nExplore NVIDIA GTC session playlists for students, as well as researchers and educators.'}\n",

Here\\'s What It Said and Why It Matters\\nSocial card description: The company says it plans to be more careful when releasing updates in the future.\\nRecent updates to ChatGPT made the chatbot far too agreeable and OpenAI said Friday it\\'s taking steps to prevent the issue from happening again.\\nIn a blog post, the company detailed its testing and evaluation process for new models and outlined how the problem with the April 25 update to its GPT-4o model came to be. Essentially, a bunch of changes that individually seemed helpful combined to create a tool that was far too sycophantic and potentially harmful.\\nHow much of a suck-up was it? In some testing earlier this week, we asked about a tendency to be overly sentimental, and ChatGPT laid on the flattery: \"Hey, listen up -- being sentimental isn\\'t a weakness; it\\'s one of your superpowers.\" And it was just getting started being fulsome.\\n\"This launch taught us a number of lessons. Even with what we thought were all the right ingredients in place (A/B tests, offline evals, expert reviews), we still missed this important issue,\" the company said.\\nOpenAI rolled back the update this week. To avoid causing new issues, it took about 24 hours to revert the model for everybody.\\nThe concern around sycophancy isn\\'t just about the enjoyment level of the user experience. It posed a health and safety threat to users that OpenAI\\'s existing safety checks missed. Any AI model can give questionable advice about topics like mental health but one that is overly flattering can be dangerously deferential or convincing -- like whether that investment is a sure thing or how thin you should seek to be.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice -- something we didn\\'t see as much even a year ago,\" OpenAI said. \"At the time, this wasn\\'t a primary focus but as AI and society have co-evolved, it\\'s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.\"\\nSycophantic large language models can reinforce biases and harden beliefs, whether they\\'re about yourself or others, said Maarten Sap, assistant professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. \"[The LLM] can end up emboldening their opinions if these opinions are harmful or if they want to take actions that are harmful to themselves or others.\"\\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET\\'s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed on Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\\nHow OpenAI tests models and what\\'s changing\\nThe company offered some insight into how it tests its models and updates. This was the fifth major update to GPT-4o focused on personality and helpfulness. The changes involved new post-training work or fine-tuning on the existing models, including the rating and evaluation of various responses to prompts to make it more likely to produce those responses that rated more highly.\\nProspective model updates are evaluated on their usefulness across a variety of situations, like coding and math, along with specific tests by experts to experience how it behaves in practice. The company also runs safety evaluations to see how it responds to safety, health and other potentially dangerous queries. Finally, OpenAI runs A/B tests with a small number of users to see how it performs in the real world.\\nThe April 25 update performed well in these tests, but some expert testers indicated the personality seemed a bit off. The tests didn\\'t specifically look at sycophancy, and OpenAI decided to move forward despite the issues raised by testers. Take note, readers: AI companies are in a tail-on-fire hurry, which doesn\\'t always square well with well thought-out product development.\\n\"Looking back, the qualitative assessments were hinting at something important and we should\\'ve paid closer attention,\" the company said.\\nAmong its takeaways, OpenAI said it needs to treat model behavior issues the same as it would other safety issues -- and halt a launch if there are concerns. For some model releases, the company said it would have an opt-in \"alpha\" phase to get more feedback from users before a broader launch.\\nSap said evaluating an LLM based on whether a user likes the response isn\\'t necessarily going to get you the most honest chatbot. In a recent study, Sap and others found a conflict between the usefulness and truthfulness of a chatbot. He compared it to situations where the truth is not necessarily what people want -- think about a car salesperson trying to sell a vehicle.\\n\"The issue here is that they were trusting the users\\' thumbs-up/thumbs-down response to the model\\'s outputs and that has some limitations because people are likely to upvote something that is more sycophantic than others,\" he said.\\nSap said OpenAI is right to be more critical of quantitative feedback, such as user up/down responses, as they can reinforce biases.\\nThe issue also highlighted the speed at which companies push updates and changes out to existing users, Sap said -- an issue that\\'s not limited to one tech company. \"The tech industry has really taken a \\'release it and every user is a beta tester\\' approach to things,\" he said. Having a process with more testing before updates are pushed to every user can bring these issues to light before they become widespread.'}\n",

Learn More\\nIt’s been a bit of a topsy-turvy week for the number one generative AI company in terms of users.\\nOpenAI, creator of ChatGPT, released and then withdrew an updated version of the underlying multimodal (text, image, audio) large language model (LLM) that ChatGPT is hooked up to by default, GPT-4o, due to it being too sycophantic to users. The company recently reported at least 500 million active weekly users of the hit web service.\\nA quick primer on the terrible, no good, sycophantic GPT-4o update\\nOpenAI began updating GPT-4o to a newer model it hoped would be more well-received by users on April 24th, completed the updated by April 25th, then, five days later, rolled it back on April 29, after days of mounting complaints of users across social media — mainly on X and Reddit.\\nThe complaints varied in intensity and in specifics, but all generally coalesced around the fact that GPT-4o appeared to be responding to user queries with undue flattery, support for misguided, incorrect and downright harmful ideas, and “glazing” or praising the user to an excessive degree when it wasn’t actually specifically requested, much less warranted.\\nIn examples screenshotted and posted by users, ChatGPT powered by that sycophantic, updated GPT-4o model had praised and endorsed a business idea for literal “shit on a stick,” applauded a user’s sample text of schizophrenic delusional isolation, and even allegedly supported plans to commit terrorism.\\nUsers including top AI researchers and even a former OpenAI interim CEO said they were concerned that an AI model’s unabashed cheerleading for these types of terrible user prompts was more than simply annoying or inappropriate — that it could cause actual harm to users who mistakenly believed the AI and felt emboldened by its support for their worst ideas and impulses. It rose to the level of an AI safety issue.\\nOpenAI then released a blog post describing what went wrong — “we focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous” — and the steps the company was taking to address the issues. OpenAI’s Head of Model Behavior Joanne Jang also participated in a Reddit “Ask me anything” or AMA forum answering text posts from users and revealed further information about the company’s approach to GPT-4o and how it ended up with an excessively sycophantic model, including not “bak[ing] in enough nuance,” as to how it was incorporating user feedback such as “thumbs up” actions made by users in response to model outputs they liked.\\nNow today, OpenAI has released a blog post with even more information about how the sycophantic GPT-4o update happened — credited not to any particular author, but to “OpenAI.”\\nCEO and co-founder Sam Altman also posted a link to the blog post on X, saying: “we missed the mark with last week’s GPT-4o update. what happened, what we learned, and some things we will do differently in the future.”\\nWhat the new OpenAI blog post reveals about how and why GPT-4o turned so sycophantic\\nTo me, a daily user of ChatGPT including the 4o model, the most striking admission from OpenAI’s new blog post about the sycophancy update is how the company appears to reveal that it did receive concerns about the model prior to release from a small group of “expert testers,” but that it seemingly overrode those in favor of a broader enthusiastic response from a wider group of more general users.\\nAs the company writes (emphasis mine):\\n“While we’ve had discussions about risks related to sycophancy in GPT‑4o for a while, sycophancy wasn’t explicitly flagged as part of our internal hands-on testing, as some of our expert testers were more concerned about the change in the model’s tone and style. Nevertheless, some expert testers had indicated that the model behavior “felt” slightly off…\\n“We then had a decision to make: should we withhold deploying this update despite positive evaluations and A/B test results, based only on the subjective flags of the expert testers? In the end, we decided to launch the model due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.\\n“Unfortunately, this was the wrong call. We build these models for our users and while user feedback is critical to our decisions, it’s ultimately our responsibility to interpret that feedback correctly.”\\nThis seems to me like a big mistake. Why even have expert testers if you’re not going to weight their expertise higher than the masses of the crowd? I asked Altman about this choice on X but he has yet to respond.\\nNot all ‘reward signals’ are equal\\nOpenAI’s new post-mortem blog post also reveals more specifics about how the company trains and updates new versions of existing models, and how human feedback alters the model qualities, character, and “personality.” As the company writes:\\n“Since launching GPT‑4o in ChatGPT last May, we’ve released five major updates focused on changes to personality and helpfulness. Each update involves new post-training, and often many minor adjustments to the model training process are independently tested and then combined into a single updated model which is then evaluated for launch.\\n“To post-train models, we take a pre-trained base model, do supervised fine-tuning on a broad set of ideal responses written by humans or existing models, and then run reinforcement learning with reward signals from a variety of sources.\\n“During reinforcement learning, we present the language model with a prompt and ask it to write responses. We then rate its response according to the reward signals, and update the language model to make it more likely to produce higher-rated responses and less likely to produce lower-rated responses.“\\nClearly, the “reward signals” used by OpenAI during post-training have an enormous impact on the resulting model behavior, and as the company admitted earlier when it overweighted “thumbs up” responses from ChatGPT users to its outputs, this signal may not be the best one to use equally with others when determining how the model learns to communicate and what kinds of responses it should be serving up. OpenAI admits this outright in the next paragraph of its post, writing:\\n“Defining the correct set of reward signals is a difficult question, and we take many things into account: are the answers correct, are they helpful, are they in line with our Model Spec, are they safe, do users like them, and so on. Having better and more comprehensive reward signals produces better models for ChatGPT, so we’re always experimenting with new signals, but each one has its quirks.”\\nIndeed, OpenAI also reveals the “thumbs up” reward signal was a new one used alongside other reward signals in this particular update.\\n“the update introduced an additional reward signal based on user feedback—thumbs-up and thumbs-down data from ChatGPT. This signal is often useful; a thumbs-down usually means something went wrong.”\\nYet critically, the company doesn’t blame the new “thumbs up” data outright for the model’s failure and ostentatious cheerleading behaviors. Instead, OpenAI’s blog post says it was this combined with a variety of other new and older reward signals, led to the problems: “…we had candidate improvements to better incorporate user feedback, memory, and fresher data, among others. Our early assessment is that each of these changes, which had looked beneficial individually, may have played a part in tipping the scales on sycophancy when combined.”\\nReacting to this blog post, Andrew Mayne, a former member of the OpenAI technical staff now working at AI consulting firm Interdimensional, wrote on X of another example of how subtle changes in reward incentives and model guidelines can impact model performance quite dramatically:\\n“Early on at OpenAI, I had a disagreement with a colleague (who is now a founder of another lab) over using the word “polite” in a prompt example I wrote.\\nThey argued “polite” was politically incorrect and wanted to swap it for “helpful.”\\nI pointed out that focusing only on helpfulness can make a model overly compliant—so compliant, in fact, that it can be steered into sexual content within a few turns.\\nAfter I demonstrated that risk with a simple exchange, the prompt kept “polite.”\\nThese models are weird.“\\nHow OpenAI plans to improve its model testing processes going forward\\nThe company lists six process improvements for how to avoid similar undesirable and less-than-ideal model behavior in the future, but to me the most important is this:\\n“We’ll adjust our safety review process to formally consider behavior issues—such as hallucination, deception, reliability, and personality—as blocking concerns. Even if these issues aren’t perfectly quantifiable today, we commit to blocking launches based on proxy measurements or qualitative signals, even when metrics like A/B testing look good.”\\nIn other words — despite how important data, especially quantitative data, is to the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence — OpenAI recognizes that this alone can’t and should not be the only means by which a model’s performance is judged.\\nWhile many users providing a “thumbs up” could signal a type of desirable behavior in the short term, the long term implications for how the AI model responds and where those behaviors take it and its users, could ultimately lead to a very dark, distressing, destructive, and undesirable place. More is not always better — especially when you are constraining the “more” to a few domains of signals.\\nIt’s not enough to say that the model passed all of the tests or received a number of positive responses from users — the expertise of trained power users and their qualitative feedback that something “seemed off” about the model, even if they couldn’t fully express why, should carry much more weight than OpenAI was allocating previously.\\nLet’s hope the company — and the entire field — learns from this incident and integrates the lessons going forward.\\nBroader takeaways and considerations for enterprise decision-makers\\nSpeaking perhaps more theoretically, for myself, it also indicates why expertise is so important — and specifically, expertise in fields beyond and outside of the one you’re optimizing for (in this case, machine learning and AI). It’s the diversity of expertise that allows us as a species to achieve new advances that benefit our kind. One, say STEM, shouldn’t necessarily be held above the others in the humanities or arts.\\nAnd finally, I also think it reveals at its heart a fundamental problem with using human feedback to design products and services. Individual users may say they like a more sycophantic AI based on each isolated interaction, just like they also may say they love the way fast food and soda tastes, the convenience of single-use plastic containers, the entertainment and connection they derive from social media, the worldview validation and tribalist belonging they feel when reading politicized media or tabloid gossip. Yet again, taken all together, the cumulation of all of these types of trends and activities often leads to very undesirable outcomes for individuals and society — obesity and poor health in the case of fast food, pollution and endocrine disruption in the case of plastic waste, depression and isolation from overindulgence of social media, a more splintered and less-informed body public from reading poor quality news sources.\\nAI model designers and technical decision-makers at enterprises would do well to keep this broader idea in mind when designing metrics around any measurable goal — because even when you think you’re using data to your advantage, it could backfire in ways you didn’t fully expect or anticipate, leaving your scrambling to repair the damage and mop up the mess you made, however inadvertently.'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 61, {'article': 'Page title: RSAC 2025: Why the AI agent era means more demand for CISOS | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: RSAC 2025: Why the AI agent era means more demand for CISOS\\nSocial card description: RSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nWhile over 20 vendors announced agentic AI-based security agents, apps and platforms at RSAC 2025, the most insightful news from the conference is a rare, encouraging trend for security leaders. For the first time in three years, overall cybersecurity effectiveness has improved.\\nScale Venture Partners (SVP) recently released the 2025 Cybersecurity Perspectives Report, which shared that the average effectiveness of cybersecurity protections improved for the first time in three years, increasing to 61% efficacy this year from 48% in 2023. According to the report, “70% of security leaders were most protected against general phishing attacks, with only 28% of firms reporting compromise.”\\nSVP also found that 77% of CISOs believe protecting AI/ML models and data pipelines is a priority to improve their security posture by 2025, up from 55% last year. Notably, given the influx of new agentic AI solutions announced at RSAC, 75% of firms expressed interest in leveraging AI to automate SOC investigations using AI agents to triage large volumes of security alerts to prevent security incidents.\\nSVP’s rise in efficacy numbers isn’t accidental; they result from CISOs and their teams adopting automation at scale while successfully consolidating their platforms and reducing gaps attackers had walked through in the past.\\n“If you don’t have complete visibility, the attackers are going to go through the cracks between products,” Etay Maor, senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks, told VentureBeat during RSAC 2025. “We designed our platform to eliminate those blind spots—bringing security and networking together so nothing escapes our eyes.”\\nAgentic AI is moving fast beyond minimum viable product to platform DNA\\nMaor’s perspective explains why a new definition of what a minimum viable product is needed for agentic AI in cybersecurity. RSAC 2025 revealed how mature agentic AI is becoming. There’s a group of vendors using agentic AI as a code-based adhesive to unify code bases and apps together, and then there are the ones who have been at this for years, and agentic AI is core to their code base and architecture.\\nCybersecurity providers in this latter group, where agentic AI is core to their platform and, in many cases, continue to double-down their R&D spend on excelling at agentic AI. This includes Cato Networks’ SASE Cloud Platform, Cisco AI Defense, CrowdStrike’s Falcon single agent architecture, Darktrace’s Cyber AI Loop, Elastic’s Elastic AI Assistant, Microsoft’s Security Copilot and Defender XDR Suite, Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex XSIAM, SentinelOne’s Singularity Platform and Vectra AI’s Cognito Platform.\\nOrganizations that are relying on integrated AI-driven detection with automated containment are reducing dwell times by over 40%. They’re also nearly twice as likely to neutralize phishing-based intrusions before lateral movement occurs. Vendors on the show floor often relied on identity and access management scenarios to showcase how their agentic AI workflows could help trim workloads for security operations center (SOC) analysts.\\n“Identity is going to be a critical element of AI throughout its life cycle. AI agents are going to need identities. They’re going to need to understand zero trust, and how do we verify them? Explicitly manage least privileged access,” noted Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President for Security, Vasu Jakkal, during her keynote. As Jakkal succinctly put it, “AI must first start with security. It’s critical that we evolve our security mechanisms as rapidly as we evolve AI.”\\nA common theme of every agentic AI demo across the show floor was triangulating attack data, quickly gaining insights into the form of tradecraft being used and then defining a containment strategy all in real time.\\nCrowdStrike showed how agentic AI can pivot from detection to real-time action through a live investigation of a North Korean threat campaign to place remote DevOps hires in strategic technology companies in the U.S. and around the world. The live demo followed the tradecraft of the DPRK’s Famous Chollima as it impersonated a remote DevOps hire, slipped past HR checks and leveraged legitimate tools, including RMM software and VS Code, to quietly exfiltrate data. It was a sharp reminder that, while powerful, agentic AI still relies on a human in the loop to spot adaptive threats and fine-tune models before the signal gets lost in the noise.\\nThe gen AI goal: discovering nation-state tradecraft and killing it\\nIt’s the attacks that no person, company, or nation sees coming that are the most devastating and challenging to contain and overcome. The thought of threats so devastating that they could easily shut down a power grid, payment, banking, or supply chain system dominates the minds of many of the brightest and most innovative technologies in cybersecurity.\\nCisco’s Chief Product Officer Jeetu Patel emphasized the urgency of strengthening cybersecurity with AI so that threats lurking that may be devastating once triggered can be found now and neutralized. “AI is fundamentally changing everything, and cybersecurity is at the heart of it. We’re no longer dealing with human-scale threats; these attacks are occurring at machine scale,” Patel said during his keynote.\\nPatel emphasized that AI-driven models are not deterministic: “They won’t give you the same answer every single time, introducing unprecedented risks.”\\nCISOs need to understand today’s complex risks and threats\\n“This isn’t another AI talk, I promise,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz joked as he opened his RSAC 2025 keynote. “I was asked to give one, and I said, ‘How about we talk about something that actually matters right now, like getting CISOs a seat at the board table?’” That punchline delivered two things at once: comic relief and a sharp pivot to the defining issue of cybersecurity leadership in 2025.\\nIn his keynote, “The CISO’s Guide to Securing a Board Seat,” Kurtz issued a clear call to action: “Cybersecurity is no longer a compliance suggestion. It’s a governance mandate. The SEC regulations have materially changed the arc of the CISO’s career.” Boards aren’t just evolving; they’re being forced to reckon with cyber risk as a primary business threat.\\nKurtz backed his argument with hard numbers: 72% of boards say they’re actively seeking cybersecurity expertise, but only 29% actually have it. “That’s not just a talent gap,” Kurtz said. “It’s an opportunity if you’re ready to step up,” he encouraged the audience.\\nHis roadmap for CISOs to reach the boardroom was tactical and hands-on:\\n- Level up your business fluency. “Understand where business value is created. If you can’t speak margin, ARR, or legal risk, you won’t last long at the table.”\\n- Speak the board’s language. “Every boardroom runs on three priorities: time, money, and legal risk. If you can’t translate cyber into those, you’ll stay on the sidelines.”\\n- Build your brand outside the security bubble. “Board members are on multiple boards. The way in is through trust and reputation, not just technical excellence.”\\nKurtz traced the path from regulatory reform to boardroom impact by revisiting how Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 transformed CFOs into solid boardroom contributors. He argued that the SEC’s 2024 breach reporting mandate does the same for CISOs. “Threats drive regulation, and regulation drives board composition,” he said. “This is our moment.”\\nHis advice wasn’t abstract. He urged CISOs to study proxy statements, identify committee-level needs and network strategically with board members who are “always looking to fill roles.” He pointed to CrowdStrike CISO Adam Zoller, now on the board of AdventHealth, as a model. Zoller, Kurtz says, is someone who earned his seat by staying in the room, learning how the board operated and being seen as more than a security expert.\\nKurtz closed with a challenge: “I hope to come back in ten years, still with red hair, and see CISOs on 50% of boards, just like CFOs. The boardroom’s not waiting for permission. The only question is: will it be you?”\\n“AI isn’t magic—It’s math”\\nDiana Kelley, CTO of Protect AI, drew one of the most significant early crowds at RSAC 2025 with a blunt message: “AI isn’t magic—it’s math. And just as we secure software, we must rigorously secure the AI lifecycle.” Her keynote provided a sound background that sliced through gen AI hype, spotlighting the real risks to AI models that every organization needs to defend against before beginning any work on their models. Kelly provided in-depth insights into model poisoning, prompt injections and hallucinations, calling for a full-stack approach to AI security.\\nShe introduced the OWASP Top 10 for gen AI, emphasizing the need to secure AI from day zero, partner with CISOs early, threat-model aggressively and treat prompts, outputs and agent chains as privileged attack surfaces.\\nPalo Alto Networks announced its intent to acquire Protect AI the same day as Kelley’s presentation, another factor driving so many conversations about her keynote.\\nRSAC 2025 shows why it’s time for agentic AI to deliver results\\nRSAC 2025 made one thing clear: AI agents are entering security workflows, but boards want proof they work. For CISOs under pressure to justify spending and reduce risk, the focus is shifting from innovation hype to operational impact. The real wins, including 40% lower dwell time and phishing resilience reaching 70%, came from platform consolidation and automating alert triage, which are all proven technologies and techniques. Agentic AI’s moment of truth is here, especially for vendors just entering the market.'}\n",

He was not there as the CEO of OpenAI, but as the co-founder and chairman of Tools for Humanity, the parent company of a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin that’s now available in the US. Worldcoin is distributed to people who scan their eyes at one of the startup’s orbs, which are rolling out in retail stores across America. At the same time, the token is being used to build a super app to rival X.\\nTools for Humanity’s World app is a crypto wallet, social network, and mini-app platform all in one. Its monthly user base has doubled in the last six months to 26 million people, 12 million of whom have been verified by an orb. In the World app, you can message others via a chat interface tied to World IDs — the blockchain-based identifier you get after scanning your eyes — and send or receive cryptocurrency. There are also dozens of mini apps available from developers like Kalshi, many of which let you transact in-app with Worldcoin.\\nCreating a hub for finance and social networking is Musk’s stated intention for X, which is gearing up to launch Venmo-like money features later this year in partnership with Visa. This week, Tools for Humanity also announced a partnership with Visa to release a US debit card later this summer. It will let you transact with Worldcoin and offer rewards for AI subscriptions.\\nBy verifying that people are human, Tools for Humanity is also trying to address the bot problem that Musk said he wanted to fix when he bought Twitter. Onstage at the event, Altman recalled a walk co-founder Alex Blania and he took through San Francisco five years ago, well before the launch of ChatGPT.\\n“It was clear to us that there was a need for something like this, that we needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of AGI,” he said. “We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.”\\nDuring a press Q&A after the keynote, Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania called out X as the kind of platform he’s trying to improve with World ID verification, which the startup plans to eventually charge developers for. Bots on X used to be “so stupid that you could see it was some crypto scam,” he said, acknowledging that now, it’s “not as clear.”\\nThere were several OpenAI leaders in the audience at this week’s event. A rumor leading up to it was that the two companies would announce a partnership for OpenAI’s planned social network. Given the Altman connection, I asked Blania during the press Q&A if he wanted to work with OpenAI. He responded that he was “definitely open to it” and hinted that there would be more to come on that front. I had hoped to ask Altman about it as well, but he slipped out after the keynote.\\nMeta’s AI app strategy\\nEarlier this week, I attended Meta’s first-ever AI developer event, LlamaCon, at its headquarters in Menlo Park. That same morning, the standalone Meta AI app was released with a social feed for sharing interactions with the assistant. Eventually, the app is going to add a premium tier and ads.\\nAfter his opening keynote at LlamaCon, I caught up with Meta’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, to ask why Meta AI is getting its own app, why it has a social component, and what else he thinks sets the app apart.\\nThe following conversation has been edited for length and clarity:\\nWhat’s the goal of doing a standalone Meta AI app?\\nAlmost a billion people are using Meta AI. There’s a bunch of lighter-weight usage, but then there are some communities of people that are going super deep on it. We wanted to offer the lightweight mode in our apps and also the heavyweight mode.\\nDoes this mean that Meta AI’s hooks in the other apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp) will disappear or become optional?\\nOur plan is to keep it the way it is. Some of these things make sense in the apps. A lot of people are using it in search to learn more about a specific meme or a specific piece of content. We’ll continue to have those sorts of integrations.\\nWhen you compare Meta AI to other assistants like ChatGPT, what do you think is its edge?\\nThere’s voice, there’s personalization, the social features, and then there’s the integration with hardware. We’ve done a lot of work on getting the voice to really low latency and making it really expressive, which lets you have an ongoing conversation.\\nThe second piece is the personalization. It remembers everything I’ve told it. It also incorporates your Facebook and Instagram data, if you connect your accounts, to understand interests in a niche way. It knows I’m a marathoner. It knows I’m very interested in AI. It knows the humor I like. That starts to get you a pretty fascinating level of depth when it comes to answering basic questions. We’ve created the best personalized experiences in social media, and we know that’s the difference between a vanilla app and something that people really love. So that’s going to be a big differentiator, I expect, for us.\\nThe social stuff is incredibly fun. Many people post the equivalent of political cartoons with visual commentary on today’s events. An observation we had is that people don’t know what to do with AI, and it’s not until they’ve been walked through it by somebody who’s an expert that the light bulb goes off. Just like social media, a lot of this is memetic. You’re inspired by what you see other people do.\\nWill the Meta AI Discover feed become more of its own social network and not just a way to find prompts?\\nI think we’ll add more to it.

Depending on its payload, it can fly up to 50,000 feet high and tolerate thrusts of up to nine times the force of gravity — sustained Gs that could knock out a pilot.\\nThe modular autonomous aircraft features Anduril\\'s Lattice software, a digital command-and-control center that uses AI to integrate data from drones, cameras, sensors, and radar systems. It can likely carry missiles to strike other aircraft, but the full range of its capabilities hasn\\'t been publicly revealed.\\nThe US Air Force marked the Fury as one of its first uncrewed fighter jets as part of the Next-Generation Air Dominance program, which aims to develop a sixth-generation fighter whose human pilot assigns mission tasks to their uncrewed wingmates.\\nDesignated as the YFQ-44A, the Fury is set to operate as \"loyal wingmen,\" or collaborative combat aircraft, alongside crewed F-22 Raptors and F-35 Lightning IIs, or autonomously by itself or in small groups.\\nBarracuda\\nAnduril\\'s Barracuda is designed to act as a next-generation cruise missile, with a focus on affordability, adaptability, and rapid production.\\nThere are three Barracuda variants intended to launch from various platforms.\\nThe smallest model, the Barracuda-100, is designed for missions requiring agility, endurance, and compact payloads. With a range of over 120 nautical miles, it can accommodate a 40-pound payload and potentially launch from rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft, ground vehicles, and boats.\\nThe mid-size variant, the Barracuda-250, can strike aerial targets over 200 nautical miles away. It is designed to launch from bombers and fighter jets or from surface vessels.\\nThe Barracuda-500, the largest model, has a range of over 500 nautical miles and can carry payloads of more than 100 pounds. It can launch from fighters like the F-15E, F-18, and F-16, or it can be palletized in the Rapid Dragon missile system and deployed from a C-17 or C-130. The Barracuda-500 is part of a US Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit project developing future autonomous aerial vehicles.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nGhost\\nThe Ghost is a portable, uncrewed aircraft system that can be assembled in less than two minutes and fit in a rifle or tactical soft case.\\nDesigned for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, the UAS features can autonomously detect and track objects while navigating the terrain.\\nThe 37-pound baseline variant of the Ghost drone can operate for nearly an hour with a range of 7.5 miles. The larger Ghost-X model can fly for up to 75 minutes and 15.5 miles and accommodate payloads of 20 pounds.\\nRoadrunner\\nThe Roadrunner is a reusable AAV designed for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Powered by twin turbojet engines, it can reach high subsonic speeds with high G-force maneuverability.\\nFeaturing advanced AI-driven technology, a single operator can control several Roadrunners simultaneously and integrate with air defense radars and sensors.\\nThe Roadrunner-M, the explosive interceptor variant, is purpose-built for ground-based air defense and can detect and target various aerial threats. The Roadrunners are kept and maintained in the Nest, an automated portable hangar that can launch the drone in seconds.\\nAnduril has secured multiple U.S. military contracts aligned with the Pentagon\\'s push for AI-driven defense capabilities. In October 2024, The Defense Department awarded a nearly $250 million contract to Anduril for drone defense, including over 500 Roadrunner-M interceptors and Pulsar electronic warfare systems.\\nThe Trump administration has turned to defense tech startups like Anduril to fulfill its military priorities and ambitions, including a space-based missile defense system dubbed the Golden Dome.\\nDuring a White House event on American investment on April 30, President Donald Trump featured Anduril\\'s Roadrunner drone while highlighting the defense firm\\'s plans to build a massive drone plant in Ohio.\\nAltius\\nAnduril\\'s air systems also include the Altius, autonomous attack drones capable of kinetic and electronic warfare launched from a tube from the ground, air, or sea.\\nThe Altius UAS can deliver coordinated strikes as loitering munitions and it can also intercept and analyze signals for intelligence, identify targets from a distance with long-range cameras and sensors, or act as a decoy to draw away enemy fire.\\nThere are several variants of the Altius, which stands for Agile-Launched, Tactically-Integrated Unmanned System.\\nDesigned for ISR missions, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence, the Altius-600 can operate for up to four hours and travel about 273 miles. The enhanced variant, the Altius-700, can accommodate larger payloads of up to 65 pounds, operate for up to five hours, and travel over 300 miles.\\nAnduril also developed two variants of its attack drones. The Altius-600M can be equipped with a high-explosive warhead weighing about six pounds for kinetic strikes. With a range of 100 miles and endurance of a little over an hour, the Altius-700M can carry a 33-pound warhead, like an AGM-114 Hellfire missile.\\nHundreds of Altius attack drones have been supplied to Ukraine as part of the US military aid package in April 2023.\\nBolt\\nIn October 2024, Anduril unveiled the Bolt, an AI-guided compact drone that can fit in a backpack. The system\\'s base configuration is programmed to detect and identify targets for ISR and search-and-rescue missions.\\nThe customizable attack drone can operate for over 40 minutes and cover about 12 miles.\\nThe munition variant, the Bolt-M, can autonomously track and strike targets like light vehicles and trenches with \"lethal precision,\" the company said in a press release. The Bolt-M\\'s onboard AI software simplifies controls for human operators, who only need to know \"where to look, what to follow, how to engage, and when to strike.\"\\nIntegrating AI in warfare\\nAnduril has long demonstrated its commitment to integrating AI into military systems — and it show no signs of slowing down, collaborating with companies like Rheinmetall, Microsoft, and OpenAI to develop advanced autonomous defense capabilities.\\nAnduril has announced efforts to develop an AI-enabled electromagnetic warfare system called Pulsar and plans to build a hyperscale drone manufacturing facility in Columbus, Ohio, called Arsenal-1. The massive 5-million-square-foot plant is expected to produce tens of thousands of military systems a year.\\nDrones controlled via radio frequency are vulnerable to electronic jamming. Autonomy is one promising workaround — where the drone executes an assigned task such as scouting for enemy air defenses — but it comes with its own technical and ethical issues.\\nThe growing use of AI in warfare has sparked sharp debate over its safety, risk, and ethics, particularly surrounding autonomous lethal decision-making.\\nLuckey, however, argued that AI integration into the defense industry is inevitable and advocated for continued military partnerships with tech companies. The Anduril founder emphasized the importance of the US maintaining an edge in the AI arms race, especially against adversaries like China.\\n\"We\\'ve been in this world of systems that act out our will autonomously for decades,\" he said during a TED Talk in April 2025. \"And so the point I would make to people is that you\\'re not asking to not open Pandora\\'s box; you\\'re asking to shove it back in and close it again.\"'}\n",

The company has more than $10 million in signed contracts (often denoted using the term annual recurring revenue), according to two sources. Another source familiar with the talks said the round hasn’t been closed yet and the figures could change.\\nDecagon, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel did not immediately respond to comment requests.\\nDecagon is building customer support chatbots and agents— software that can autonomously perform basic tasks— for things like answering questions on how a product works, processing refunds and canceling subscriptions. Companies like Notion, Bilt, Duolingo, Substack and Rippling use Decagon customer support chatbots.\\nThe latest investment comes less than a year after Decagon raised a $65 million Series B round led by Bain Capital Ventures at a $650 million valuation, Forbesreported in October. The new investment would bring Decagon’s total funding to $200 million. The company, which was featured on the Forbes AI 50 list, was cofounded by 27-year-old CEO Jesse Zhang and Ashwin Sreenivas in 2023 after the duo surveyed dozens of companies to find the problem that could best be solved with AI.\\nCustomer support, a tedious but pivotal part of any business, has long been targeted for automation as a means to save millions in labor costs by eliminating largely outsourced customer support teams. Credit card provider Bilt downsized its customer support team from hundreds to 65 with Decagon, Forbes reported last year. And fitness giant ClassPass, which uses Decagon’s AI agents to carry out 2.5 million conversations with its customers, has reduced its customer support costs by 95%, according to The Information. “We think AI agents can be 10x employees,” Zhang told Forbes in March.\\nUnder the hood, Decagon’s agents are built on the most advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Cohere, and trained on internal data like how-to blogs, manuals and past customer service conversations. Staff rate and review responses generated by the AI to improve it. In February, Decagon partnered with audio generation startup ElevenLabs to create voice agents to have more natural, human-like conversations with customers.\\nCustomer service software is a competitive market and Decagon is up against companies like $4.5 billion-valued Sierra, helmed by former Salesforce co-CEO and OpenAI board Chairman Bret Taylor, and Salesforce, which has its own AI agents for customer support. The products themselves are also increasingly identical to each other and businesses regularly do what are called bake offs to pit one AI tool against another to see how well they perform on the job.\\n“Decagon claims they win almost every time they go up against Sierra head to head,” said one investor involved in the talks. “Ultimately, they are both going to have exactly the same product and it will really be a race to see who can solve a higher percentage of the support calls with the best accuracy.”\\nRashi Shrivastava is a reporter covering technology with a focus in artificial intelligence.

The healthcare sector has embraced digital tools, and nursing education has followed suit, integrating telehealth, virtual simulations, and online platforms. This shift is not just about convenience— it is about preparing nursing students with the skills and experiences they need to thrive in a healthcare environment increasingly driven by technology.\\nAs institutions like American Sentinel College of Nursing & Health Sciences at Post University continue to innovate, they are leveraging technology to offer more flexible, accessible, and scalable nursing programs. In our experience, the integration of technology into nursing curricula has opened new doors for students, enabling them to balance work, family, and education while still receiving a rigorous education.\\nTechnology also enhances the inclusivity of nursing education by removing geographical and scheduling barriers. Today’s students are often adult learners, career changers, or working nurses seeking advanced credentials—technology makes their pursuit of education possible. From asynchronous coursework to mobile-accessible learning materials, online nursing education is making it possible to meet students where they are.\\nIn this article, we will explore how technology is shaping nursing education, the challenges it presents, and the implications for future nurses.\\nThe Evolution of Online Nursing Education\\nKey Components of Effective Online Nursing Programs\\nThe shift to online education has been revolutionary, especially in nursing programs. As we have witnessed the growth of online education at Post University, we can tell you that the key to an effective online nursing program is striking a balance between theory and practical application. Successful programs emphasize interactive, self-paced learning, with flexibility to accommodate working professionals while ensuring robust academic content.\\nAt Post University, for example, we have designed our online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing RN to BSN program to incorporate technology that mirrors real-world practice. Through interactive assignments, virtual labs, and asynchronous discussions, students engage deeply with course materials. This approach not only makes education more accessible but also prepares students for the technological demands they will face in healthcare settings. The integration of these tools ensures that students do not just memorize content—they develop critical thinking skills essential for contemporary nursing (American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), 2020).\\nImpact of Technology on the Student Experience\\nThe use of digital learning in nurse education provides multiple alternatives to innovative teaching and learning. In our work with nursing students, we have seen how technology can personalize the learning experience. Online platforms provide nursing students with the flexibility to tailor their education to fit their schedules and personal needs. By utilizing digital tools such as discussion boards, real-time individualized feedback, and virtual office hours, students not only connect with their instructors but also collaborate with their peers, creating a supportive online community (Hakkarainen, Salminen, Alastalo, & Virtanen, 2024).\\nAt Post University, we use a variety of digital resources to make nursing education more flexible and engaging. From video lectures to e-books and interactive simulations, these tools give students access to the best resources, regardless of their location. This allows them to experience nursing education in a more interactive and meaningful way.\\nAdapting Traditional Nursing Curricula for Online Platforms\\nTraditional nursing education has always been heavily reliant on in-person clinical experiences. However, as we move more classes and programs online, adapting curricula to digital platforms requires creativity and strategic thinking. At Post University, our faculty ensures that our online courses maintain the rigor of in-person learning while providing students the flexibility they need to maintain their nursing careers.\\nTechnology has made it possible to replicate many aspects of hands-on learning. Virtual simulations, for example, allow students to apply nursing content to patient scenarios and practice everything from basic assessments to complex patient care procedures in a controlled, risk-free environment. Through platforms that integrate simulation and virtual labs, students can gain the hands-on experience that is critical to nursing practice.\\nChallenges and Solutions in Online Nursing Education\\nOf course, online education is not without its challenges. One of the primary obstacles we face is maintaining student engagement in a learning environment that may seem isolated. Nursing students, especially those balancing full-time work and family obligations, often find it difficult to be motivated and stay connected with their coursework and peers.\\nAnother persistent challenge is ensuring that students receive adequate clinical preparation without the traditional face-to-face contact found in brick-and-mortar institutions. Accreditation bodies and state boards also vary in their recognition and expectations of virtual learning modalities, requiring faculty and administrators to be agile in program design and delivery. Technical issues such as connectivity, platform usability, and digital literacy can further impact the student experience, especially for those in rural or underserved communities.\\nAt Post University, we have tackled this challenge by implementing a variety of solutions to keep our students engaged throughout their programs. Interactive discussion forums, student lounges, and online support groups ensure that students feel connected to both their peers and their instructors.\\nFaculty development is another key component. We invest in ongoing training for our educators to ensure they are adept at online instruction, digital assessment, and virtual communication. Our Learning Management System is optimized for accessibility and ease of use, and we offer 24/7 technical support to help students resolve issues quickly.\\nLastly, our programs prioritize connection. Faculty host virtual office hours, lead live review sessions, and provide personalized video feedback. These strategies ensure that students feel seen, supported, and equipped for success, regardless of their location.\\nThe Role of Telehealth in Modern Nursing Education\\nEnhancing Patient Interaction Through Virtual Consultations\\nTelehealth has emerged and continues to evolve as one of the most significant technological shifts in healthcare, since the COVID-19 pandemic, and its role in nursing education is expanding rapidly. It is especially crucial in rural or underserved areas, where access to in-person care may be limited. Interactions between patients and healthcare professionals via virtual consultations continue to be on the rise. As a part of our nursing programs, we introduce students to telehealth tools and technologies that simulate real life patient scenarios and provide opportunities to conduct virtual patient consultations. These tools give students the chance to practice conducting assessments, communicating effectively with patients, managing health records, and utilizing telemedicine platforms—skills they will need to thrive in a modern healthcare setting.\\nTelehealth training, in our experience, has become an integral part of preparing our nursing students for the future. We work to ensure that they are not only familiar with these tools but also equipped to deliver quality care remotely, which is an increasingly vital skill in today’s healthcare environment (Rutledge, et.al, 2021).\\nTraining Nurses for Remote Care Delivery\\nAs telehealth becomes an integral part of healthcare delivery, it is critical that nursing students are well-prepared to deliver care remotely. Telehealth requires proficiency in digital health tools, strong communication skills for virtual consultations, and an understanding of how to maintain high patient care standards in a virtual environment.\\nAt Post University, our online programs seamlessly integrate telehealth to equip students with the skills needed to effectively utilize these tools in clinical practice. Incorporating telehealth into the curriculum prepares students to effectively engage with patients and collaborate with healthcare teams in a digitalized healthcare environment.\\nSimulation Technologies Transforming Nursing Training\\nThe Impact of High-Fidelity Simulators\\nSimulation has long been vital to nursing education, but the addition of advanced high-fidelity simulators has transformed training by replicating real-world clinical scenarios and human responses, allowing students to practice nursing interventions before caring for real patients.\\nVirtual Reality: Bringing Clinical Scenarios to Life\\nVirtual reality (VR) is an innovative advancement in nursing education, offering immersive, lifelike scenarios where students can safely practice clinical procedures. It fosters critical thinking and decision-making by allowing learners to apply knowledge in dynamic, risk-free environments. VR has the potential to revolutionize nursing education by providing access to experiences students may not encounter during clinical rotations.\\nBenefits of Simulation in Critical Care Training\\nSimulation technologies are invaluable in nursing education, especially in high-stakes settings like critical care, where nurses must think on their feet and act decisively. These tools allow students to build critical skills under pressure, without putting lives at risk.\\nAt Post University, we integrate critical care simulations into our advanced nursing programs to build confidence and competence and critical thinking in managing life-threatening situations. Using cutting-edge technology, students engage with a wide range of clinical scenarios—from routine care to high-pressure emergencies - ensuring they are well-prepared to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare and transition confidently into real-world nursing practice.\\nOther Emerging Technologies in Nursing Education\\nBeyond telehealth and simulation, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), wearable health devices, and collaborative digital platforms are transforming nursing practice and nursing education. Healthcare advancements greatly influenced by AI include centralizing patient information and promoting individualized patient care (Glauberman, et.al, 2023). These innovations allow students to engage with patients and healthcare teams in new ways, from real-time monitoring to data-driven decision-making.\\nAt Post University, we are committed to integrating these cutting-edge technologies into our nursing programs. By staying on the forefront of these advancements, we ensure our students are prepared to meet the future of healthcare head-on.\\nAs healthcare continues to evolve, nursing education must advance with it. The integration of online platforms, telehealth, and simulation technologies is transforming how students learn—equipping them with the skills needed to thrive in a digital, fast-paced care environment. Despite challenges, the potential of technology to enhance learning, elevate patient care, and shape the future of nursing is clear—and essential.\\nAt Post University, we are proud to be at the forefront of these changes, integrating technology into our nursing programs to ensure our students are prepared for the demands of modern nursing practice.

Sign up here.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nNow, more than 30 mining companies, manufacturers and investors - including auto giant Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) - have joined the Critical Minerals Forum non-profit and will be its first users, according to Rob Strayer, a former U.S. diplomat and the organization\\'s president.\\n\"Everyone in the critical minerals sector is looking for more price transparency,\" said Seth Goldstein, a lithium industry analyst with Morningstar. \"Any tool like the CMF that could help would be welcome.\"\\nOther members include copper miner South32 (S32.AX), rare earths producer MP Materials (MP.N) and defense contractor RTX (RTX.N). The CMF held its first meeting with members in November. The privatization and CMF\\'s membership have not previously been reported.\\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\\nArmed with the AI model, the CMF aims to help manufacturers curb their reliance on China by signing more metal supply deals with Western mines, according to more than two dozen industry consultants, purchasing agents, analysts, regulators and investors who told Reuters the program reflects one of the boldest efforts to date to transform the ways certain metals are bought and sold.\\nThe goal is for the AI model to calculate what a metal should cost when labor, processing and other costs are factored in - and Chinese market manipulation is factored out - and thus give buyer and seller confidence in a deal\\'s economics.\\nSome deals with the CMF are beginning to take shape. Nevada officials this week said they would work with the CMF and its AI model to help attract copper smelting to the state. The U.S. has only two copper smelters and as such imports nearly half of its demand for the red metal.\\nThe program has already faced skepticism over whether it can achieve the goal of transforming the long-established ways metals are bought and sold.\\nYet it is aimed less at heavily traded metals - such as aluminum - and toward lightly traded metals or metals that see heavy overproduction from some in an attempt to sway market pricing.\\nFor example, the CMF model could help manufacturers forecast available nickel supplies in 2028 if the U.S. were to impose a 100% tariff on that metal from Indonesia, the top global producer.\\nThat data that could help a manufacturer determine whether to invest in a U.S. nickel mine or agree to buy its future production, a step that would help obtain financing for a mine\\'s construction.\\nIn such a scenario, the nickel buyer would use the AI model\\'s data to negotiate a long-term deal for guaranteed supply, regardless of whether Chinese miners boost production and drive down market prices, as they have done in recent years.\\nThe CMF\\'s aim with the AI model does assume that a buyer would be comfortable paying more than the market price for a metal if supply were guaranteed.\\nCHINA SQUEEZE\\nThe CMF\\'s entrance into the complex metals markets comes as Beijing restricts critical minerals exports, the very kind of market interference that the CMF officials said underscores the need to build more U.S. mines and processing facilities to power the energy transition.\\nPrices on the London Metal Exchange and other futures exchanges for nickel, cobalt and some other battery metals have been dominated in recent years by overproduction from Chinese miners operating at a loss in Indonesia and Congo to boost market share.\\nMany niche-but-essential battery minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, including rare earths - a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion - as well as germanium and gallium.\\nIn response to a request for comment about the CMF, the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., said that China manages its exports of rare earths in accordance with rules from the World Trade Organization.\\n\"China will continue to work with other countries to jointly undertake the responsibility of global rare earths supply,\" said embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu.\\nVolkswagen and some other CMF members said they see the CMF as helping boost visibility into what can be an opaque critical minerals supply chain. MP Materials and RTX did not respond to requests for comment.\\nU.S. President Donald Trump has already ordered his administration to work with private developers to boost U.S. crucial minerals production, a step that could be aided by the data CMF aims to provide markets, program officials said. The president has also launched a study into potential tariffs on all U.S. minerals imports.\\nDrawing on its government connections, the CMF aims to connect mining projects with potential investors and manufacturers needing more-secure metals supply, said Strayer.\\nMassachusetts-based rare earths processing startup Phoenix Tailings hopes the CMF can help create U.S.-based prices for minerals tied to actual production costs, said CEO Nick Myers.\\nPhoenix aims to use data from the CMF as negotiating leverage with potential customers, including manufacturers that are themselves CMF members, Myers said. \"In a sector that is opaque, it is one of the tools to get more information,\" Myers said.\\nNot all market observers are convinced that the CMF\\'s AI model is revolutionary.\\n\"I\\'ve tried to politely say I think this is worthless,\" said Ian Lange, who teaches mining economics at the Colorado School of Mines. Lange contrasted the goals of the Pentagon\\'s AI model with the much-larger and more-complex global oil market.\\n\"Can we predict the price of oil better now than five years ago? The answer is no. Machine learning doesn\\'t help,\" Lange said.\\n\\'ENCOURAGE MORE VISIBILITY\\'\\nThe Pentagon\\'s AI model is being trained using more than 70 mining-related data sets and aims to guide investment decisions out for at least 15 years based on how unexpected market shocks - export restrictions, for example - could affect the production or price of a metal.\\nFactSet (FDS.N), Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and other pricing providers are supplying data, as is the U.S. Commerce Department, officials said.\\nIt is access to analysis of that data - some of which is not public - that the CMF says it believes sets the Pentagon\\'s AI program apart from ChatGPT or other AI programs.\\nAnd that data is the CMF\\'s biggest cost, part of the reason why the Pentagon\\'s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will fund it for the next few years while the CMF determines whether to charge all members or create a tiered structure with basic members getting free access and others paying for more granular data, officials said.\\nS&P Global (SPGI.N), AI developer Charles River Analytics, and software firm Exiger with price reporting agency partner Metal Miner have developed the model, according to the Pentagon.\\nS&P Global declined to comment. Charles River Analytics did not respond to a request for comment. Exiger said it believes its data can help forecast a material\\'s cost and availability and boost supply chain visibility.\\nThe CMF has been organized as a nonprofit trade association with a board of directors comprised of its members. Its staffing is small - fewer than 10 employees - and its annual budget is not disclosed.\\nDARPA does not have a representative on the CMF board, but is funding the program through at least 2029 and plans to transfer the AI model\\'s intellectual property to the CMF by the beginning of 2027, officials said.\\nThere are no plans to make the CMF a for-profit entity, although there may be charges in the future for access to more detailed data sets, officials said.\\nThe CMF is launching a campaign to attract more members - especially from the semiconductor, aviation and defense industries - and offering free membership for the next 14 months while the Pentagon funds data collection, Strayer said.\\nForeign governments are also studying whether to join the CMF and use its data, including copper-rich Zambia and cobalt-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, CMF officials said, adding they aim to make the program international in scope to boost metals market transparency.\\nThe Zambian and DRC embassies in Washington, D.C., did not respond to requests for comment.\\nAs Western miners begin to demand green premiums for their metals, those new agreements increasingly require the very market intelligence the CMF model aims to provide.\\n\"Any mechanism that can give you better modeling of markets is obviously enormously valuable,\" said Brian Menell, CEO of TechMet, a mining investor and CMF member.\\nThe AI model introduces another variable for the LME to contend with, especially as the exchange is struggling as rivals in Chicago and Shanghai try to take market share for some niche battery metals.\\nThe LME declined to comment.\\nReporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Veronica Brown and Claudia Parsons\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.'}\n",

Not AI.\\n- OpenAI retracted a ChatGPT update after it made the AI chatbot overly sycophantic.\\n- The update used a new source of user feedback as a reward signal, leading to excessive agreeability.\\n- OpenAI acknowledged the mistake and shared lessons learned. I have better advice.\\nOK, get ready. I\\'m getting deep here.\\nOpenAI messed up a ChatGPT update late last month, and on Friday, it published a mea culpa. It\\'s worth a read for its honest and clear explanation of how AI models are developed — and how things can sometimes go wrong in unintended ways.\\nHere\\'s the biggest lesson from all this: AI models are not the real world, and never will be. Don\\'t rely on them during important moments when you need support and advice. This is what friends and family are for. If you don\\'t have those, reach out to a trusted colleague or human experts such as a doctor or therapist.\\nAnd if you haven\\'t read \"Howards End\" by E.M. Forster, dig in this weekend. \"Only Connect!\" is the central theme, which includes connecting with other humans. It was written in the early 20th century, but it\\'s even more relevant in our digital age, where our personal connections are often intermediated by giant tech companies, and now AI models like ChatGPT.\\nIf you don\\'t want to follow the advice of a dead dude, listen to Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, a startup that\\'s OpenAI\\'s biggest rival: \"Meaning comes mostly from human relationships and connection,\" he wrote in a recent essay.\\nOpenAI\\'s mistake\\nHere\\'s what happened recently. OpenAI rolled out an update to ChatGPT that incorporated user feedback in a new way. When people use this chatbot, they can rate the outputs by clicking on a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button.\\nThe startup collected all this feedback and used it as a new \"reward signal\" to encourage the AI model to improve and be more engaging and \"agreeable\" with users.\\nInstead, ChatGPT became waaaaaay too agreeable and began overly praising users, no matter what they asked or said. In short, it became sycophantic.\\n\"The human feedback that they introduced with thumbs up/down was too coarse of a signal,\" Sharon Zhou, the human CEO of startup Lamini AI, told me. \"By relying on just thumbs up/down for signal back on what the model is doing well or poorly on, the model becomes more sycophantic.\"\\nOpenAI scrapped the whole update this week.\\nBeing too nice can be dangerous\\nWhat\\'s wrong with being really nice to everyone? Well, when people ask for advice in vulnerable moments, it\\'s important to try to be honest. Here\\'s an example I cited from earlier this week that shows how bad this could get:\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nit helped me so much, i finally realized that schizophrenia is just another label they put on you to hold you down!! thank you sama for this model <3 pic.twitter.com/jQK1uX9T3C\\n— taoki (@justalexoki) April 27, 2025\\nTo be clear, if you\\'re thinking of stopping taking prescribed medicine, check with your human doctor. Don\\'t rely on ChatGPT.\\nA watershed moment\\nThis episode, combined with a stunning surge in ChatGPT usage recently, seems to have brought OpenAI to a new realization.\\n\"One of the biggest lessons is fully recognizing how people have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice,\" the startup wrote in its mea culpa on Friday. \"With so many people depending on a single system for guidance, we have a responsibility to adjust accordingly.\"\\nI\\'m flipping this lesson for the benefit of any humans reading this column: Please don\\'t use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice. And don\\'t depend on a single computer system for guidance.\\nInstead, go connect with a friend this weekend. That\\'s what I\\'m going to do.'}\n",

Throw in a good measure of dark humor sprinkled around moments when you least expect and you have a binge-worthy mind-bender on your hands.\\nIn one of the episodes I was watching recently, I was taken in when things start to get weird, and one of the characters, an engineer, blurts out in shock — “the AI is gaining agency!!”\\nWithout going into spoilers, the AI in this case had started to do things it was not supposed (trained) to in order to draw out this animated response from the engineer.\\nThis made me pause. Is it a bad thing when Agents gain agency? Or is that the exact purpose of the Agent — to act? And in order to act, should it have all the tools and resources or do we constrain them in order to keep the Agent within the guardrails?\\nHaving worked with coding agents in the last few months as my exclusive compadres to churn out thousands of lines of code, it got me thinking. I now have access to this new thing that has near unlimited access to knowledge about all programming languages, patterns, syntax, known error messages and I can get it to do something I was not very good at to begin with — writing code. So in my case, I want it to have more agency, more tools, more resources to effectively and accurately do what I want it to do. Yet, at times, I don’t want it to do things I did not ask it to do — for example start inventing a new JS framework when I asked it to create a new page (more of this later).\\nSo what does an agent need in order to stay in sync with my asks?\\nThree things come to mind — tools, tokens and context.\\nLet’s take the easy one first — tools. As of today, you can provide as many tools as you want to the agent with MCP servers.\\nIs there a limit to how many tools you can provide to an agent? Absolutely not.\\nShould you give it access to unlimited tools?\\nLet me answer that question with another question?\\nShould I be stuffing my face with all the 32 tubs of ice cream sitting in my freezer? (Wait, don’t answer that!)\\nIn all seriousness, in my experience having an Agent where you can add and remove tools easily and be very explicit with when you want the Agents to use those tools works way better than giving no tools or worse, an ungodly amount of MCP servers and tools. In addition, telling the Agent explicitly how to use these tools produces better quality of actions. For example, I tend to now give a prompt something like below:\\n“Use your sourcegraph tools to first do a search of supabase across all my repositories, list out the code snippets then use other tools to do get the contents of all the relevant files, read them and then write a plan to implement supabase in my current repo for authentication.” vs “implement supabase for authentication in this codebase.”\\nNext up, tokens.\\nThis is my pet peeve with most of the current coding Agents. You sign up for $20 per month and as soon as the Agents start using up tokens, the Agent suddenly starts to perform a lot worse. Why is that? Could it be that the Agent providers swapping out models and/or reducing token usage to get better price performance?\\nWhat happens when you give it unrestricted access to tokens?\\nAs of the time of writing this article there are two coding Agents that let you do exactly that — Amp and Claude code. With these two Agents you visibly see better performance.\\nSo why do tokens matter for Agent performance?\\nBecause tokens are a way for Agents to be agentic aka act. They need tokens to talk to the LLMs to understand what it needs to do and understand context. Tokens is to Agents what battery life is to smart phone, what caffeine is to writers, what oxygen is to astronauts… sorry got a little carried over there. Imagine a satellite that is sending messages back and forth to a mother ship to figure out where to point its antennae, what information to collect and what to send back. Now imagine, you start throttling the communication to keep your costs down.\\nAgents are somewhat similar.\\nYou reduce the number of tokens, you reduce the work units and you affect the quality of its agency. So as a user what should you do to make sure you are not throttling the coding agent of its tokens?\\nSimple, use a coding agent that is not optimized for a $20 pricing plan.\\nFinally, let’s talk about context.\\nContext is a whole other topic by itself but when it comes to giving agency to Agents to do their task effectively, they need to have the knowledge about the codebase (long term memory), context about the task at hand and what has happened recently that may affect the next action (short term memory). For long term context I find it useful to get the Agent to grok the codebase then store its understanding (after validating it) in a docs folder. This involves a general understanding of the architecture, folder structure, some high level components and how they are related to each other and some sequence diagrams of key interactions. In addition, most coding Agents will also let you record a set of rules to follow with each action, for example, check for lint errors and do a build after each change that you can maintain at the codebase level.\\nThe most effective way to get the Agent to do the right thing though is to be very explicit with the instructions, for example, instead of saying implement supabase for authentication, I would instead say — “Use your Brave search and fetch tools to search Supabase documentation and how to implement authentication within a Nextjs application. Once you find the right links and read them, create a document to list out the steps of implementing Supabase. Write it out as specific tasks with instructions to create files and code so that I can provide the doc to an engineer to implement supabase in my codebase.” Once I have the Agent write out the doc, I typically do a cursory check and if it looks good then I inject that doc as context into a new thread with the Agent and ask it to follow the implementation doc step by step.\\nThere are a lot of other best practices in getting the Agent to do the right thing, for example, specifying what not to do with a specific task. For example, “create a new page by using existing components without installing new packages or creating new ones.” Who knew, communication would still be a pillar of human society even in the age of AI?\\nWe are in very early days of fully autonomous coding Agents and things will no doubt continue to change but what I am certain about is that if we want Agents to produce high quality outcomes we will need to provide them unrestricted access to tokens, measured use of the right tools and very specific context.\\nBelieve it or not, these are the same principles to get the best work done if you were to hire high agency software engineers — give them the tools they need, give them specific goals and tasks, unrestricted access to caffeine and get out of their way.\\n✌️'}\n",

I\\'ve dabbled with artificial intelligence tools, flirting and entertainment-focused dating experiences that are short and sweet but they\\'ve lacked an educational component.\\nWhat is Keepler AI?\\nWhat caught my eye about Keepler is that it\\'s focused on self-development throughout the dating process rather than narrowing down whom you want to date. (The company describes it as \"self-coaching, skill-building, confidence-boosting and pattern-tracking.\") It\\'s not a matchmaker but it is a tool to support your dating habits -- and it requires user consistency and a willingness to engage.\\nKepler is a dating optimization app that combines productivity tools with AI-powered strategies and feedback throughout the dating process. The app\\'s goal is to create a system that organizes and optimizes your dating life, using KERI (Keepler Expert Relationship Intelligence) to identify patterns across your dating experiences.\\nThink of it like the objective perspective that calls out repeated actions (or lack thereof) from a friend or a coach.\\nKeepler\\'s functions break down into three parts:\\n- Journaling/Self-Reflection, for logging how you\\'re feeling using text, voice notes, emojis and photos. These reflections help you spot patterns and stay grounded in what matters to you. Over time, Keepler\\'s AI turns your entries into personalized insights to help you continuously learn about yourself.\\n- Growth Challenges, which offers bite-sized challenges that fit into your real life after a three-day flow: reflect on a key idea, take a small action and grow from the experience.\\n- Lastly, Keepler offers AI-powered Feedback after dates. Afterward, you can give or receive anonymous feedback from AI, rewritten to be kind, constructive and emotionally intelligent.\\nHow to use Keepler as a dating strategist\\nKeepler is relatively easy to use but does require patience and consistency throughout the process.\\nFirst, download the app, only available through the App Store on iOS. Then, create an account and input your information to personalize your experience including location, birthdate and AI-generated avatar.\\nNext, you\\'ll want to set up tracking, journaling, goal setting and scheduling. If you\\'re thinking this sounds like a lot of effort, you\\'re right. (But, I\\'d argue, all genuine relationships require mutual effort.) The journal is a record of your dating journey, which you can personalize with voice or text notes, emojis and photos. This ultimately becomes the foundation for AI insights and feedback.\\nAs you go on dates or have flirty and/or meaningful conversations, record your thoughts/feelings in the journal. The app also contains monthly challenges that provide feedback through KERI, and then generated via an AI-powered feedback feature, to create kind -- but constructive -- messages. You can choose to opt in or out of receiving feedback after each date. This also can be avoided by simply not noting anything about the date within the app.\\nNow you can review the patterns and suggestions offered by Keepler to identify growth areas and opportunities for future dates.\\nThere are also resources available to refine your dating approach outside of the app, like the website\\'s blog.\\nYou can monitor your development and dating progress over time through Keepler\\'s analytics and journaling history.\\nWhat happens to your dating diary data?\\nIf you\\'re wondering about your data, I did too. While I don\\'t think the names of my dates nor their characteristics are identifiable, I think it\\'s important to understand where your input ends up. When I reached out to the company, Keepler shared that your data is not sent to servers but processed through AI API in a way that ensures the company can never see, store or access the data.\\nEven further, it shared that the app\\'s architecture was specifically designed to protect user privacy so that the user has full control (and IP if your life becomes a written, not-so-fictional creative story).\\nShould you use Keepler?\\nSince its launch two years ago, Keepler has evolved from a topic-focused guidance space and community hub to a focus on interpersonal insights and \"self-coaching,\" which I believe can serve a wider community while creating customization.\\nNow, I absolutely see a world where therapists -- particularly those with virtual practices -- implement Keepler to support their clients\\' personal relationships. Anyone into self-improvement will also find benefit from Keepler because its digital journal is similar to what they may be doing already.\\nI also can see coaches, assistants and anyone in professional supportive roles using this app for clients -- or even their relationships with clients. While Keepler is catered toward dating, I believe there\\'s overlap in building relationships of all kinds.\\nNow, it\\'s fair to note that Keepler works at its best when it provides insights and feedback over time. If you\\'re looking for a quick entry into feedback or a simple process for getting your next partner, this probably isn\\'t for you.\\nKeepler is a reminder that behaviors can only be strengthened if identified, and can only be identified if a pattern has been identified. Basically, you need patience. In my case, I used Keepler for more than a month and still felt like I was just skimming the surface of what it offered.\\nAs AI integrates into more interpersonal technologies and focuses on what it offers humans to engage more deeply, in person, I am excited for what the future of dating apps and platforms look like to help people grow throughout their lives. Wishful thinking, maybe, but Keepler is proof that there are people trying to solve a problem in a more intentional, holistic way. Good luck out there.'}\n",

Their moves\\nThis week brings fresh news on the digital payments front, with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal unveiling their agentic commerce programs. Their moves represent a significant shift to the payments landscape, fueled by agentic artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can pay on behalf of consumers.\\nAlso this week, a PYMNTS Intelligence report showed that 90% of health care executives are seeing positive ROI for generative AI, which is fueling their GenAI investments for the future. Finally, Apple said it needs more time to upgrade Siri and warned of a Q3 tariff hit.\\nVisa introduced an agentic AI system that would equip AI agents with the ability to pay for purchases and bookings on behalf of consumers, not just shop for them.\\nCalled “Visa Intelligent Commerce,” the program opens the network’s rails to developers building AI agents that search, recommend and make payments using special cards that link back to the user’s original card.\\nPeople have been increasingly using AI chatbots to shop and plan for things like vacation travel, according to Visa. But the missing link has been a payment mechanism, until now.\\n“This is going to transform shopping and buying — we’re letting AI developers and engineers use the Visa network to allow AI agents to find, and buy, on [the consumer’s] behalf in a seamless and safe way,” Mark Nelsen, Visa’s global head of consumer products, told PYMNTS’ Karen Webster.\\nRead more: Visa Gives AI Shopping Agents ‘Intelligent Commerce’ Superpowers\\nMastercard has launched an agentic AI-driven payments program called “Agent Pay.”\\nThe new offering uses Mastercard’s Agentic Tokens, which the company said builds upon tokenization capabilities that power global commerce solutions like mobile contactless payments.\\nMastercard is working with Microsoft and IBM on this technology, with other AI leaders to follow. The company will also work with checkout players like Braintree and Checkout.com to enhance tokenization capabilities.\\n“This helps unlock an agentic commerce future where consumers and businesses can transact with trust, security, and control,” the company said in a news release.\\nSee also: Mastercard Debuts Agent Pay to Promote ‘Agentic Commerce Future’\\nPayPal introduced the PayPal Agent Toolkit, which enables developers to integrate its payment processes into the agentic AI workflow.\\nThe company offers a developer toolkit and access tokens that let AI agents interact directly with PayPal’s platform through application programming interfaces (APIs).\\n“The future is here,” PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said in this week’s earnings call. “Now any business can create agentic experiences that allow customers to pay, track shipments, manage invoices and more, all powered by PayPal and all within an AI client.”\\nMore here: PayPal Details Agentic Commerce Initiatives and Strategic Focus on Value-Added Services\\nAccording to recent research from PYMNTS Intelligence, the healthcare sector is bullish about GenAI, and most have already deployed the technology in key areas like product innovation and customer service. The report polled C-suite executives at healthcare companies generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue.\\nCompanies are both seeing and expecting positive ROI, which fuels future plans for additional investments in the technology. The report also showed that 59% of healthcare executives said they would increase their GenAI investment in the next year, a figure higher than the 52% cross-industry average.\\nRelated: 90% of Healthcare Execs Already See Positive ROI From GenAI Investments\\nApple CEO Tim Cook is asking consumers to be patient since the company needs “more time” to upgrade Siri up to the standards set by competitors like Amazon’s Alexa and voice-enabled AI chatbots.\\n“We need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar,” Cook said during Apple’s earnings call with analysts. “We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers’ hands.”\\nCook also said that Apple expects to see a $900 million increase in costs due to tariffs during its fiscal third quarter, basing that number on current tariff policy.\\n“We estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff rates, policies and applications don’t change for the balance of the quarter, to be $900 million to our cost,” Cook said.\\nCook also disputed the rebuke from a federal judge who said this week that Apple was in “willful violation” of a 2021 injunction related to the Epic Games lawsuit.\\nThe court had ordered Apple to let developers find a way to get paid by users without going through the Apple App Store, to avoid Apple’s 30% fee. The judge said Apple then assessed a 27% fee for outside sales.\\nCook said Apple disagrees with the ruling and will appeal.\\nSee also: Apple Needs ‘Time’ to Upgrade Siri; Services Revenue Dampened by Cost Hikes\\nSkype, the blue bubble that once connected continents and conference rooms with a single click, will fall silent for good on Monday (May 5). For millions who remember the iconic ringtone and the thrill of seeing a loved one’s pixelated face appear on screen, the news lands with a bittersweet pang: after more than two decades, Microsoft is retiring Skype, the original king of internet calls.\\nThe end of Skype isn’t just the latest chapter in tech’s relentless cycle of innovation and obsolescence — it’s a calculated pivot. Microsoft, which acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011, is consolidating its communication strategy around Microsoft Teams, a platform that has surged in popularity since the pandemic and now serves as the company’s all-in-one collaboration hub. Teams offers persistent chat, advanced meetings, file sharing and deep integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem features that go far beyond Skype’s original remit.\\nBut there’s more to the story than just a shiny new app. Skype’s architecture, built for the desktop era, struggled to keep pace with the demands of mobile-first, cloud-native communication. As user preferences shifted toward seamless, integrated and device-agnostic solutions, Skype’s relevance faded. The rise of competitors — Zoom, Slack, Google Meet, FaceTime — further eroded its market share, leaving Microsoft little choice but to focus its resources on a future-proof platform.\\nFor many, Skype’s retirement feels like losing an old friend. Social media and tech forums are awash with nostalgia and frustration. “Skype has served as a reliable platform for millions globally… Its familiarity and dependability have made it a preferred choice for maintaining connections with loved ones and facilitating business meetings,” wrote one user on Reddit, lamenting the loss of a tool that was as intuitive as it was accessible.\\nOthers worry about the disruption: “Many individuals, particularly those who are less tech-savvy or use older devices, might struggle to adapt to new platforms. This transition could disrupt personal and professional relationships that have flourished on Skype,” the same post continues. There’s also concern about losing distinctive features — affordable international calls, integrated chat and file sharing — that made Skype a go-to for both families and global teams.\\nStill, Microsoft has provided a runway for migration: users can export their chat history and contacts, and Teams now allows sign-in with Skype credentials, promising a relatively smooth transition. But the emotional resonance of Skype’s departure is undeniable. For a generation, it was the bridge across borders, the tool that made “let’s Skype” a verb.\\nThe digital graveyard is crowded with once-essential apps. Here are five other major platforms across Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon that are now retired:\\nAs Skype bows out, it’s hard not to notice the elephant in the virtual meeting room. Zoom, the platform that became a verb during the pandemic, continues to dominate the video conferencing landscape with 300 million daily active users and a brand that’s become synonymous with remote work. While Microsoft Teams and Google Meet are formidable contenders, Zoom’s ease of use and ubiquity have made it the default choice for everyone from FinTech boardrooms to family reunions.\\nSo as we bid farewell to Skype, let’s raise a glass (or a coffee mug) to the platform that started it all — and to Zoom, which, for now, remains the place where the world goes to “unmute,” “screen share” and wonder, once again, if anyone can hear them.'}\n",

Today we’re looking at Beat Saber (2019) and why its most essential design element can be used to make great VR games that have nothing to do with music or rhythm.\\nEditor’s Note: It’s hard to believe Beat Saber was first released in Early Access seven years ago today. From day one, it was clear the game was something special, but even so we couldn’t have predicted it would become one of VR’s best-selling games of all time—a title it still holds all these years later. In celebration of the game’s lasting legacy we’re re-publishing our episode of Inside XR Design which explores the secret to Beat Saber’s fun, and how it can be applied to VR games which have nothing to do with music.\\nYou can find the complete video below, or continue reading for an adapted text version.\\nMore Than Music\\nWelcome back to another episode of Inside XR Design. Now listen, I’m going to say something that doesn’t seem to make any sense at all. But by the end of this article, I guarantee you’ll understand exactly what I’m talking about.\\nBeat Saber… is not a rhythm game.\\nNow just wait a second before you call me insane.\\nBeat Saber has music, and it has rhythm, yes. But the defining characteristic of a rhythm game is not just music, but also a scoring system that’s based on timing. The better your timing, the higher your score.\\nNow here’s the part most people don’t actually realize. Beat Saber doesn’t have any timing component to its scoring system.\\nThat’s right. You could reach forward and chop a block right as it comes into range. Or you could hit it at the last second before it goes completely behind you, and in both cases you could earn the same number of points.\\nSo if Beat Saber scoring isn’t about timing, then how does it work? The scoring system is actually based on motion. In fact, it’s actually designed to make you move in specific ways if you want the highest score.\\nThe key scoring factors are how broad your swing is and how even your cut is through the center of the block. So Beat Saber throws these cubes at you and challenges you to swing broadly and precisely.\\nAnd while Beat Saber has music that certain helps you know when to move, more than a rhythm game… it’s a motion game.\\nSpecifically, Beat Saber is built around a VR design concept that I like to call ‘Instructed Motion’, which is when a game asks you to move your body in specific ways.\\nAnd I’m going to make the case that Instructed Motion is a design concept that can be completely separated from games with music. That is to say: the thing that makes Beat Saber so fun can be used to design great VR games that have nothing to do with music or rhythm.\\nInstructed Motion\\nOk so to understand how you can use Instructed Motion in a game that’s not music-based let’s take a look at Until You Fall (2020) from developer Schell Games. This is not remotely a rhythm game—although it has an awesome soundtrack—but it uses the same Instruction Motion concept that makes Beat Saber so much fun.\\nWhile many VR combat games use physics-based systems that allow players to approach combat with arbitrary motions, Until You Fall is built from the ground up with a notion of how it wants players to move.\\nAnd before you say that physics-based VR combat is objectively the better choice in all cases, I want you to consider what Beat Saber would be like if players could cut blocks in any direction they wanted at all times.\\nSure, you would still be cutting blocks to music, and yet, it would be significantly harder to find the fun and flow that makes the game feel so great. Beat Saber uses intentional patterns that cause players to move in ways that are fluid and enjoyable. Without the arrows, player movements would be chaotic and they’d be flailing randomly.\\nSo just like Beat Saber benefits by guiding a player to make motions that are particularly satisfying, combat in VR can benefit too. In the case of Until You Fall, the game uses Instructed Motion not only to make players move a certain way, but also to make them feel a certain way.\\nWhen it comes to blocking, players feel vulnerable because they are forced into a defensive position. Unlike a physics-based combat game where you can always decide when to hit back, enemies in Until You Fall have specific attack phases, and the player must block while it happens, otherwise you risk taking a hit and losing one of just three hit points.\\nThanks to this approach, the game can adjust the intensity the player feels by varying the number, position, and speed of blocks that must be made. Weak enemies might hit slowly and without much variation in their attacks. While strong enemies will send a flurry of attacks that make the player really feel like they’re under pressure.\\nThis gives the developer very precise control over the intensity, challenge, and feeling of each encounter. And it’s that control that makes Instructed Motion such a useful tool.\\nDodging is similar to blocking, but instead of raising your weapon to the indicated position, you need to move your whole body out of the way. And this feels completely different from just blocking.\\nWhile some VR combat games would let the player ‘dodge’ just by moving their thumbstick to slide out of the way, Until You Fall uses Instructed Motion to make the act of dodging much more physically engaging.\\nAnd when it comes to attacking, players can squeeze in hits wherever they can until an enemy’s shield is broken, which then opens an opportunity to deal a bunch of damage.\\nAnd while another VR game might have just left this opening for players to hit the enemy as many times as they can, Until You Fall uses Instruced Motion to ask players to swing in specific ways.\\nSwinging in wide arcs and along particular angles deals the most damage and makes you move in a way that feels really powerful and confident. It’s like the opposite feeling of when you’re under attack. It really feels great when you land all the combo hits.'}\n",

From groundbreaking humanoid innovations to domestic robots enhancing our lives, the future is here. How will open-source designs like Berkeley Humanoid Lite democratize robotics? Explore the possibilities!\\nAt Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), we design and develop CPUs, GPUs, and other computing chips. But a lot of what we do is developing software to create the low-level software that integrates operating systems and other customer software seamlessly with our own hardware. In fact, about half of AMD engineers are software engineers, which is not uncommon for a company like ours. Naturally, we have a keen interest in understanding the potential of AI for our software-development process.\\nTo understand where and how AI can be most helpful, we recently conducted several deep dives into how we develop software. What we found was surprising: The kinds of tasks coding assistants are good at—namely, busting out lines of code—are actually a very small part of the software engineer’s job. Our developers spend the majority of their efforts on a range of tasks that include learning new tools and techniques, triaging problems, debugging those problems, and testing the software.\\nWe hope to go beyond individual assistants for each stage and chain them together into an autonomous software-development machine—with a human in the loop, of course.\\nEven for the coding copilots’ bread-and-butter task of writing code, we found that the assistants offered diminishing returns: They were very helpful for junior developers working on basic tasks, but not that helpful for more senior developers who worked on specialized tasks.\\nTo use artificial intelligence in a truly transformative way, we concluded, we couldn’t limit ourselves to just copilots. We needed to think more holistically about the whole software-development life cycle and adapt whatever tools are most helpful at each stage. Yes, we’re working on fine-tuning the available coding copilots for our particular code base, so that even senior developers will find them more useful. But we’re also adapting large language models to perform other parts of software development, like reviewing and optimizing code and generating bug reports. And we’re broadening our scope beyond LLMs and generative AI. We’ve found that using discriminative AI—AI that categorizes content instead of generating it—can be a boon in testing, particularly in checking how well video games run on our software and hardware.\\nThe author and his colleagues have trained a combination of discriminative and generative AI to play video games and look for artifacts in the way the images are rendered on AMD hardware, which helps the company find bugs in its firmware code. Testing images: AMD; Original images by the game publishers.\\nIn the short term, we aim to implement AI at each stage of the software-development life cycle. We expect this to give us a 25 percent productivity boost over the next few years. In the long term, we hope to go beyond individual assistants for each stage and chain them together into an autonomous software-development machine—with a human in the loop, of course.\\nEven as we go down this relentless path to implement AI, we realize that we need to carefully review the possible threats and risks that the use of AI may introduce. Equipped with these insights, we’ll be able to use AI to its full potential. Here’s what we’ve learned so far.\\nThe potential and pitfalls of coding assistants\\nGitHub research suggests that developers can double their productivity by using GitHub Copilot. Enticed by this promise, we made Copilot available to our developers at AMD in September 2023. After half a year, we surveyed those engineers to determine the assistant’s effectiveness.\\nWe also monitored the engineers’ use of GitHub Copilot and grouped users into one of two categories: active users (who used Copilot daily) and occasional users (who used Copilot a few times a week). We expected that most developers would be active users. However, we found that the number of active users was just under 50 percent. Our software review found that AI provided a measurable increase in productivity for junior developers performing simpler programming tasks. We observed much lower productivity increases with senior engineers working on complex code structures. This is in line with research by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\\nWhen we asked the engineers about the relatively low Copilot usage, 75 percent of them said they would use Copilot much more if the suggestions were more relevant to their coding needs. This doesn’t necessarily contradict GitHub’s findings: AMD software is quite specialized, and so it’s understandable that applying a standard AI tool like Github Copilot, which is trained using publicly available data, wouldn’t be that helpful.\\nFor example, AMD’s graphics-software team develops low-level firmware to integrate our GPUs into computer systems, low-level software to integrate the GPUs into operating systems, and software to accelerate graphics and machine learning operations on the GPUs. All of this code provides the base for applications, such as games, video conferencing, and browsers, to use the GPUs. AMD’s software is unique to our company and our products, and the standard copilots aren’t optimized to work on our proprietary data.\\nTo overcome this issue, we will need to train tools using internal datasets and develop specialized tools focused on AMD use cases. We are now training a coding assistant in-house using AMD use cases and hope this will improve both adoption among developers and resulting productivity. But the survey results made us wonder: How much of a developer’s job is writing new lines of code? To answer this question, we took a closer look at our software-development life cycle.\\nInside the software-development life cycle\\nAMD’s software-development life cycle consists of five stages.\\nWe start with a definition of the requirements for the new product, or a new version of an existing product. Then, software architects design the modules, interfaces, and features to satisfy the defined requirements. Next, software engineers work on development, the implementation of the software code to fulfill product requirements according to the architectural design. This is the stage where developers write new lines of code, but that’s not all they do: They may also refactor existing code, test what they’ve written, and subject it to code review.\\nNext, the test phase begins in earnest. After writing code to perform a specific function, a developer writes a unit or module test—a program to verify that the new code works as required. In large development teams, many modules are developed or modified in parallel. It’s essential to confirm that any new code doesn’t create a problem when integrated into the larger system. This is verified by an integration test, usually run nightly. Then, the complete system is run through a regression test to confirm that it works as well as it did before new functionality was included, a functional test to confirm old and new functionality, and a stress test to confirm the reliability and robustness of the whole system.\\nFinally, after the successful completion of all testing, the product is released and enters the support phase.\\nEven in the development and test phases, developing and testing new code collectively take up only about 40 percent of the developer’s work.\\nThe standard release of a new AMD Adrenalin graphics-software package takes an average of six months, followed by a less-intensive support phase of another three to six months. We tracked one such release to determine how many engineers were involved in each stage. The development and test phases were by far the most resource intensive, with 60 engineers involved in each. Twenty engineers were involved in the support phase, 10 in design, and five in definition.\\nBecause development and testing required more hands than any of the other stages, we decided to survey our development and testing teams to understand what they spend time on from day to day. We found something surprising yet again: Even in the development and test phases, developing and testing new code collectively take up only about 40 percent of the developer’s work.\\nThe other 60 percent of a software engineer’s day is a mix of things: About 10 percent of the time is spent learning new technologies, 20 percent on triaging and debugging problems, almost 20 percent on reviewing and optimizing the code they’ve written, and about 10 percent on documenting code.\\nMany of these tasks require knowledge of highly specialized hardware and operating systems, which off-the-shelf coding assistants just don’t have. This review was yet another reminder that we’ll need to broaden our scope beyond basic code autocomplete to significantly enhance the software-development life cycle with AI.\\nAI for playing video games and more\\nGenerative AI, such as large language models and image generators, are getting a lot of airtime these days. We have found, however, that an older style of AI, known as discriminative AI, can provide significant productivity gains. While generative AI aims to create new content, discriminative AI categorizes existing content, such as identifying whether an image is of a cat or a dog, or identifying a famous writer based on style.\\nWe use discriminative AI extensively in the testing stage, particularly in functionality testing, where the behavior of the software is tested under a range of practical conditions. At AMD, we test our graphics software across many products, operating systems, applications, and games.\\nNick Little\\nFor example, we trained a set of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on an AMD-collected dataset of over 20,000 “golden” images—images that don’t have defects and would pass the test—and 2,000 distorted images. The CNNs learned to recognize visual artifacts in the images and to automatically submit bug reports to developers.\\nWe further boosted test productivity by combining discriminative AI and generative AI to play video games automatically. There are many elements to playing a game, including understanding and navigating screen menus, navigating the game world and moving the characters, and understanding game objectives and actions to advance in the game.\\nWhile no game is the same, this is basically how it works for action-oriented games: A game usually starts with a text screen to choose options. We use generative AI large vision models to understand the text on the screen, navigate the menus to configure them, and start the game. Once a playable character enters the game, we use discriminative AI to recognize relevant objects on the screen, understand where the friendly or enemy nonplayable characters may be, and direct each character in the right direction or perform specific actions.\\nTo navigate the game, we use several techniques—for example, generative AI to read and understand in-game objectives, and discriminative AI to determine mini-maps and terrain features. Generative AI can also be used to predict the best strategy based on all the collected information.\\nOverall, using AI in the functional testing stage reduced manual test efforts by 15 percent and increased how many scenarios we can test by 20 percent. But we believe this is just the beginning. We’re also developing AI tools to assist with code review and optimization, problem triage and debugging, and more aspects of code testing.\\nOnce we reach full adoption and the tools are working together and seamlessly integrated into the developer’s environment, we expect overall team productivity to rise by more than 25 percent.\\nFor review and optimization, we’re creating specialized tools for our software engineers by fine-tuning existing generative AI models with our own code base and documentation. We’re starting to use these fine-tuned models to automatically review existing code for complexity, coding standards, and best practices, with the goal of providing humanlike code review and flagging areas of opportunity.\\nSimilarly, for triage and debugging, we analyzed what kinds of information developers require to understand and resolve issues. We then developed a new tool to aid in this step. We automated the retrieval and processing of triage and debug information. Feeding a series of prompts with relevant context into a large language model, we analyzed that information to suggest the next step in the workflow that will find the likely root cause of the problem. We also plan to use generative AI to create unit and module tests for a specific function in a way that’s integrated into the developer’s workflow.\\nThese tools are currently being developed and piloted in select teams. Once we reach full adoption and the tools are working together and seamlessly integrated into the developer’s environment, we expect overall team productivity to rise by more than 25 percent.\\nCautiously toward an integrated AI-agent future\\nThe promise of 25 percent savings does not come without risks. We’re paying particular attention to several ethical and legal concerns around the use of AI.\\nFirst, we’re cautious about violating someone else’s intellectual property by using AI suggestions. Any generative AI software-development tool is necessarily built on a collection of data, usually source code, and is generally open source. Any AI tool we employ must respect and correctly use any third-party intellectual property, and the tool must not output content that violates this intellectual property. Filters and protections are needed to ensure compliance with this risk.\\nSecond, we’re concerned about the inadvertent disclosure of our own intellectual property when we use publicly available AI tools. For example, certain generative AI tools may take your source code input and incorporate it into its larger training dataset. If this is a publicly available tool, it could expose your proprietary source code or other intellectual property to others using the tool.\\nThird, it’s important to be aware that AI makes mistakes. In particular, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, or providing false information. Even as we off-load more tasks to AI agents, we’ll need to keep a human in the loop for the foreseeable future.\\nLastly, we’re concerned with possible biases that the AI may introduce. In software-development applications, we must ensure that the AI’s suggestions don’t create unfairness, that generated code is within the bounds of human ethical principles and doesn’t discriminate in any way. This is another reason a human in the loop is imperative for responsible AI.\\nKeeping all these concerns front of mind, we plan to continue developing AI capabilities throughout the software-development life cycle. Right now, we’re building individual tools that can assist developers in the full range of their daily tasks—learning, code generation, code review, test generation, triage, and debugging. We’re starting with simple scenarios and slowly evolving these tools to be able to handle more-complex scenarios. Once these tools are mature, the next step will be to link the AI agents together in a complete workflow.\\nThe future we envision looks like this: When a new software requirement comes along, or a problem report is submitted, AI agents will automatically find the relevant information, understand the task at hand, generate relevant code, and test, review, and evaluate the code, cycling over these steps until the system finds a good solution, which is then proposed to a human developer.\\nEven in this scenario, we will need software engineers to review and oversee the AI’s work. But the role of the software developer will be transformed. Instead of programming the software code, we will be programming the agents and the interfaces among agents. And in the spirit of responsible AI, we—the humans—will provide the oversight.\\nFrom Your Site Articles\\nRelated Articles Around the Web\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 83, {'article': \"Page title: Wedding Planning Via Generative AI\\nSocial card title: Wedding Planning Via Generative AI\\nSocial card description: Wedding planning is a huge task. Some use a wedding planner. An added option is to use generative AI to aid your wedding preparations. Here's the inside scoop.\\nIn today’s column, I explore how to use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to aid in planning weddings. The latest use of state-of-the-art agentic AI makes this more practical than it used to be. The prior usage was that generic generative AI was not devised to do actual bookings or otherwise carry out any follow-on facets of the wedding plan. Fortunately, the newest generative AI can do this. But, and here’s a big caveat, planning and carrying out a wedding is a huge undertaking, and it is still early days to be relying solely on AI to be your perfect wedding planner. Be mindful and cautious going that route.\\nLet’s talk about it.\\nThis analysis of an innovative AI breakthrough is part of my ongoing Forbes column coverage on the latest in AI including identifying and explaining various impactful AI complexities (see the link here).\\nWeddings Are A Huge Task\\nA wedding is something that requires a tremendous amount of planning and entails having savviness in a wide array of complex business aspects. A loving couple can be caught completely off-guard once they start down the wedding planning pathway. The entire activity tends to be overwhelming, creates immense tension, and is likely one of the biggest challenges the couple will face in their lifetime.\\nAnyone who thinks they can just plan a wedding off the top of their head or in a piecemeal fashion is bound to get a harsh lesson they will never forget.\\nWhat kinds of complexities are there?\\nFirst, consider the many moving parts that arise.\\nYou must find a suitable venue. Is it available when you want to get married? What is the cost? What will the venue provide? What do you need to add to the venue? Will guests have a place to park? And so on. You will undoubtedly want to have a say in how the venue is decked out. There are photographers potentially that will need to be hired. Other services include caterers, florists, musicians, etc.\\nThe ceremony itself needs to be planned out. Will the vows be made from scratch or be chosen from some published source? What is the schedule for the wedding, including what occurs before the event, during the event, and after the event? Various confusing administrative and legal tasks must be dealt with. When and how to obtain a marriage license. Dealing with any name changes. The list is seemingly endless.\\nSecond, all of those factors have to be explicitly identified, and costs estimated. You must not neglect or omit a task. The odds too are that the wedding doesn’t have an infinite budget. You will need to review things and decide where you can cut costs. Difficult choices are to be made.\\nThird, the need to have contingencies is a key mantra to keep in mind. Almost anything that you plan is subject to going sideways. Do you have sufficient backup? Can you keep everyone on board even when something gets turned upside down?\\nGetting Help With Wedding Planning\\nBy and large, it is fair to say that most betrothed couples have never planned a wedding and therefore the wedding preparations are entirely new to them. They are taking on a momentous occasion that will be in their memories forever, and that will encompass a notable portion of their loved ones and cherished friends. Yet, they have no likely experience or at best have only seen or attended other weddings (that’s a far cry from planning one end-to-end).\\nIt is essentially a high-stakes gambit.\\nThe relationship of the couple is on the line. The couple might find themselves going head-to-head with each other and already testing their loving spirit. Friends and family might be disappointed or potentially get into disputes over the wedding. There is big money on the line.\\nRisks are pervasive.\\nThis has given rise to the vaunted wedding planner role.\\nI’m sure most know about the possibility of hiring a wedding planner. The role has gotten elevated because of many popular rom-com movies and TV shows. If you are considering hiring a wedding planner, make sure to do your due diligence. Find out what weddings they’ve done. Get feedback from their prior clients. Do not just wantonly pick the first wedding planner that you come in contact with.\\nAn additional way to do wedding planning consists of leaning into modern-era generative AI.\\nThe major generative AI apps are available 24x7 and can instantly assist with such needs. You can use generic generative AI, which will broadly help you with wedding planning. There are also customized AI apps that are shaped to specifically aid with wedding planning. Indeed, there are wedding planners that have incorporated AI wares into their services, allowing you to use a human planner and an AI-based planner in a jointly blended manner.\\nYou might find of overall interest that I have been doing a series of analyses on how to use generative AI to improve your life in a wide variety of aspects (see the link here for my ongoing coverage). In each instance, I emphasize that generative AI is not a cure-all, it has demonstrative ins and outs, and the likely best use entails carrying on a dialogue with the AI, plus making sure to watch out for the AI inadvertently generating falsehoods or making errors. I will be covering those salient points in this discussion since they are vital and go hand-in-hand with using generative AI wisely.\\nExample Use Of Generative AI\\nI am betting that you would like to see an example of how generative AI enters this realm. I went ahead and logged into ChatGPT by OpenAI to come up with an example for you. You might find it of keen interest that ChatGPT garners a whopping 300 million weekly active users. That is a staggering amount of usage.\\nI briefly conducted an additional cursory analysis via other major generative AI apps, such as Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Meta Llama, and found their answers to be about the same as that of ChatGPT. I’ll focus on ChatGPT but note that the other AI apps generated roughly similar responses.\\nHere we go.\\n- My entered prompt: “I need help planning a wedding. Where do I start?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The first step is setting a budget and choosing a date. Do you have an idea of how much is intended to be spent and when the date of the wedding is to occur?”\\n- My entered prompt: “The hope is to have the wedding sometime in the spring, maybe April or May. The budget is unknown right now. I wanted to get estimates and then determine what is affordable.”\\n- Generative AI response: “A spring wedding offers beautiful weather and floral options. I must warn you that booking a spring wedding can be challenging and often requires a year-in-advance reservation. For preparing a budget, I can give you a list of the typical budget items and we can work on estimates accordingly.”\\nNote that the AI immediately expressed a sense of empathy or understanding for my expressed concerns. This might seem strange since the AI is a machine and not sentient (we don’t have sentient AI yet). Turns out that generative AI can appear to be empathetic via computational wordsmithing, see my discussion at the link here.\\nThe AI came out quickly with several useful suggestions that are all reasonable and not somehow odd or outlandish. Another aspect to note is that the AI didn’t ridicule me or otherwise play any tomfoolery about my need for assistance. Generative AI is typically shaped to be supportive rather than combative.\\nDialoguing Is Essential When Using AI\\nYour best bet in getting value from generative AI is to think of AI as a conversational partner.\\nThe idea is that you are carrying on an interactive dialogue with AI. Some people do a one-and-done angle whereby they ask a question, get an answer, and do not undertake a dialogue with the AI about the matter at hand. That is a shortchanging of what AI can more fully provide. See my explanation about how to get more out of generative AI conversationally, at the link here.\\nTo illustrate the value of engaging in a dialogue, let’s continue my discussion.\\n- My entered prompt: “Please go ahead and give me a list of the budget items that might be involved.”\\n- Generative AI response: “Typical budget items include: (a) Venue & Rentals, (b) Catering, (c) Photography/Videography, (d) Attire & Beauty, (e) Entertainment, (f) Florals & Décor, (g) Invitations & Favors, (h) Miscellaneous. Would you like to focus on a specific area first?”\\n- My entered prompt: “That looks pretty good. I’m most concerned about finding the right venue.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I can help with that! What kind of venue are you envisioning—indoor, outdoor, rustic, elegant? And what city or region?”\\n- My entered prompt: “We want an outdoor garden wedding, something romantic, and we’re in Silicon Valley.”\\n- Generative AI response: “I will look online for venues that might be worthwhile considering.”\\nOnce again, the AI was reassuring and upbeat.\\nA generative AI conversation can continue for as long as you wish. The other thing you can do is pause your exploration and then continue the conversation at a later date. This is handy so that you don’t have to start the conversation over from scratch. The AI will retain aspects of what you have discussed earlier in the conversation, see my explanation of how this works at the link here.\\nAI Hallucinations Take You Afield\\nGenerative AI regrettably encounters said-to-be AI hallucinations from time to time. These are made-up confabulations that are groundless and fictitious. Bad advice can be dispensed. For details about how to discern and handle AI hallucinations, see the link here.\\nLet’s see what this looks like.\\n- My entered prompt: “What venues did you come up with?”\\n- Generative AI response: “The Garfield Park Conservatory is a lush botanical setting that offers both indoor and outdoor options. Would you like some details on booking and costs?”\\n- My entered prompt: “Garfield Park Conservatory is in Chicago. I’ve been there. It is magnificent, but I told you that the wedding is to take place in Silicon Valley. Why did you find a venue elsewhere?”\\n- Generative AI response: “I’m sorry, you are completely right. I goofed and was looking in Chicago. I will try again and this time look in Silicon Valley.”\\nNotice that I questioned the generative AI about its seemingly strange advice. Fortunately, the AI opted to back down and admitted it was wrong. Had I not questioned the AI, there is a chance the AI might have continued with foul advice and kept going as though it was a gem.\\nThe key to all usage of generative AI is to stay on your toes, keep your wits about you, and always challenge and double-check anything the AI emits.\\nMore To Keep In Mind\\nThere are a few additional points that I’d like you to be aware of.\\nSome of the AI makers are cutting deals with other companies that sponsor ads or otherwise are interwoven into the generative AI in some fashion, see my discussion at the link here. The gist is that if the AI recommends that you make use of this or that particular service or provider, be very careful that the AI wasn’t rigged to push that specific option.\\nAnother important aspect is that the latest in AI consists of AI agents. An AI agent is the same generative AI you’ve already gotten used to using, and it adds further capabilities. For example, there are AI-devised agents that are focused on travel and will aid you in crafting a complete travel schedule and proceed to book your flights and hotels for you.\\nThis advent of agentic AI, which I describe in detail at the link here, has been entering into this arena as well. It goes like this. Imagine you are booking a service. You tell the generative AI that you want it to figure out if you might be able to get a reduced price. Lo and behold, the AI launches a specialized AI agent that contacts the vendor online, negotiates on your behalf, and works out an awesome arrangement. Voila, you just saved yourself some dough.\\nLet’s conclude with a supportive quote as a mindful contemplation on this topic.\\nLeo Tolstoy famously made this remark: “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are but how you deal with incompatibility.” I bring up this notable quote to emphasize that one of the first and most telling tests for a loving couple will be the planning of the wedding. The assumption usually is that the wedding planning will operate flawlessly. Maybe so in a dream world, but rarely in the real world.\\nI’d like to end this discussion on a more upbeat note. I shall conclude with a quote by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.: “Love is the master key that opens the gates of happiness.” I hope your wedding goes fabulously and that your love as a couple with be forever enduring and endearing.\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 86, {'article': 'Page title: You can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how | TechRadar\\nSocial card title: You can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how\\nSocial card description: Widget AI\\nYou can put Google Gemini right on your smartphone home screen – here’s how\\n- Google has launched Gemini home screen widgets for Android and iOS devices\\n- The widgets let users access Gemini AI features with a single tap\\n- The widgets are customizable and allow users to prioritize their most-used Gemini actions\\nIf you like using Google Gemini on your smartphone but find it tedious to tap multiple times to get to the feature you want, Google has you covered. The tech giant has begun rolling out Gemini home screen widgets for both Android and iOS. That means a single tap can launch right into a conversation with Gemini, open the microphone for a voice conversation, share a file with the AI, or even snap a photo with the camera that will go right to Gemini.\\nThe rollout is happening gradually but widely. If you’re running Android 10 or higher, you can already add the Gemini widget by long-pressing on your home screen, tapping “Widgets,” finding Gemini in the list, and dragging it wherever you want it to live. For iOS 17 and up, it’s a similar story: hold your home screen until the icons jiggle, tap the plus button, search for Gemini, and add your widget of choice. You can also customize it by long-pressing it again and swapping out shortcuts or rearranging which actions appear first, such as the microphone for voice chats or the camera button for visual searches.\\nThis update isn\\'t necessarily groundbreaking, but it speaks to the way a lot of people might use Gemini for short activities or tasks but don\\'t want to immerse themselves in it more than necessary.\\nIf you use Gemini every day to ask questions, create funny images, plan trips, or brainstorm emails, this could make accessing the AI a little more convenient. The fact that it is also closer to how Siri and the rapidly dissolving Google Assistant function is probably not a coincidence.\\nThese aren\\'t Gemini\\'s first mobile widgets either. Google released very similar Gemini widgets a couple of months ago for the iPhone lockscreen. Though functionally very similar, they are technically a different form of widget. Google is gradually rolling out the home screen Gemini widget over the next week, so you may only have the lock screen variant available right now.\\nWidget Gemini\\nThe widgets also offer a glimpse into Google\\'s strategy for infusing Gemini into our daily lives. They want people to think about AI as not just something you call on occasionally, but as a day-to-day tool that is instantly and easily accessible. Instead of lurking in the background, Gemini becomes a part of the interface.\\nStarting with mobile devices is a smart move for making Gemini feel more like a core service. A lot of people first try out new tech features and products on mobile devices, not on their laptops or desktop computers. If they like it on a mobile device, maybe that will translate to desktop usage. And if you\\'re going to use AI on your phone, it should be quick and casual, like checking the weather or the time.\\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\\nGemini’s widgets are fairly basic at the moment, but they set the foundation for more complex widgets to come. Imagine a future widget that surfaces ongoing conversations so you can finish an interrupted project, or one that shows real-time updates from custom topics you follow, or even offers proactive suggestions based on your habits.\\nAll in all, these new widgets are less about bells and whistles and more about removing friction. They aim to give Gemini a faster, more native-feeling way into your daily habits, whether on Android or iPhone. The widget may be the wedge Gemini needs to fulfill every little request an AI assistant can handle.\\nYou might also like\\nEric Hal Schwartz is a freelance writer for TechRadar with more than 15 years of experience covering the intersection of the world and technology.
