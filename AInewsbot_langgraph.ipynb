    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhoutee score\n"

This made it easier for these companies to achieve a top spot on the platform’s leaderboard, though the opportunity was not afforded to every firm, the authors say.\\n“Only a handful of [companies] were told that this private testing was available, and the amount of private testing that some [companies] received is just so much more than others,” said Cohere’s VP of AI research and co-author of the study, Sara Hooker, in an interview with TechCrunch. “This is gamification.”\\nCreated in 2023 as an academic research project out of UC Berkeley, Chatbot Arena has become a go-to benchmark for AI companies. It works by putting answers from two different AI models side-by-side in a “battle,” and asking users to choose the best one. It’s not uncommon to see unreleased models competing in the arena under a pseudonym.\\nVotes over time contribute to a model’s score — and, consequently, its placement on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. While many commercial actors participate in Chatbot Arena, LM Arena has long maintained that its benchmark is an impartial and fair one.\\nHowever, that’s not what the paper’s authors say they uncovered.\\nOne AI company, Meta, was able to privately test 27 model variants on Chatbot Arena between January and March leading up to the tech giant’s Llama 4 release, the authors allege. At launch, Meta only publicly revealed the score of a single model — a model that happened to rank near the top of the Chatbot Arena leaderboard.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Available through May 9 or while tables last.\\nIn an email to TechCrunch, LM Arena Co-Founder and UC Berkeley Professor Ion Stoica said that the study was full of “inaccuracies” and “questionable analysis.”\\n“We are committed to fair, community-driven evaluations, and invite all model providers to submit more models for testing and to improve their performance on human preference,” said LM Arena in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “If a model provider chooses to submit more tests than another model provider, this does not mean the second model provider is treated unfairly.”\\nSupposedly favored labs\\nThe paper’s authors started conducting their research in November 2024 after learning that some AI companies were possibly being given preferential access to Chatbot Arena. In total, they measured more than 2.8 million Chatbot Arena battles over a five-month stretch.\\nThe authors say they found evidence that LM Arena allowed certain AI companies, including Meta, OpenAI, and Google, to collect more data from Chatbot Arena by having their models appear in a higher number of model “battles.” This increased sampling rate gave these companies an unfair advantage, the authors allege.\\nUsing additional data from LM Arena could improve a model’s performance on Arena Hard, another benchmark LM Arena maintains, by 112%. However, LM Arena said in a post on X that Arena Hard performance does not directly correlate to Chatbot Arena performance.\\nHooker said it’s unclear how certain AI companies might’ve received priority access, but that it’s incumbent on LM Arena to increase its transparency regardless.\\nIn a post on X, LM Arena said that several of the claims in the paper don’t reflect reality. The organization pointed to a blog post it published earlier this week indicating that models from non-major labs appear in more Chatbot Arena battles than the study suggests.\\nOne important limitation of the study is that it relied on “self-identification” to determine which AI models were in private testing on Chatbot Arena. The authors prompted AI models several times about their company of origin, and relied on the models’ answers to classify them — a method that isn’t foolproof.\\nHowever, Hooker said that when the authors reached out to LM Arena to share their preliminary findings, the organization didn’t dispute them.\\nTechCrunch reached out to Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Amazon — all of which were mentioned in the study — for comment. None immediately responded.\\nLM Arena in hot water\\nIn the paper, the authors call on LM Arena to implement a number of changes aimed at making Chatbot Arena more “fair.” For example, the authors say, LM Arena could set a clear and transparent limit on the number of private tests AI labs can conduct, and publicly disclose scores from these tests.\\nIn a post on X, LM Arena rejected these suggestions, claiming it has published information on pre-release testing since March 2024. The benchmarking organization also said it “makes no sense to show scores for pre-release models which are not publicly available,” because the AI community cannot test the models for themselves.\\nThe researchers also say LM Arena could adjust Chatbot Arena’s sampling rate to ensure that all models in the arena appear in the same number of battles. LM Arena has been receptive to this recommendation publicly, and indicated that it’ll create a new sampling algorithm.\\nThe paper comes weeks after Meta was caught gaming benchmarks in Chatbot Arena around the launch of its above-mentioned Llama 4 models. Meta optimized one of the Llama 4 models for “conversationality,” which helped it achieve an impressive score on Chatbot Arena’s leaderboard. But the company never released the optimized model — and the vanilla version ended up performing much worse on Chatbot Arena.\\nAt the time, LM Arena said Meta should have been more transparent in its approach to benchmarking.\\nEarlier this month, LM Arena announced it was launching a company, with plans to raise capital from investors. The study increases scrutiny on private benchmark organization’s — and whether they can be trusted to assess AI models without corporate influence clouding the process.\\nUpdate on 4/30/25 at 9:35pm PT: A previous version of this story included comment from a Google DeepMind engineer who said part of Cohere’s study was inaccurate. The researcher did not dispute that Google sent 10 models to LM Arena for pre-release testing from January to March, as Cohere alleges, but simply noted the company’s open source team, which works on Gemma, only sent one.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 2, {'article': 'Page title: AI Gone Wrong? Now There\\'s Insurance For That\\nSocial card title: AI Gone Wrong? Now There\\'s Insurance For That\\nSocial card description: In an era where AI is increasingly providing more interaction with people, new risks are emerging that demand a new approach to insurance\\nIn an era where AI is increasingly providing more interaction with people, new risks are emerging that demand a new approach to insurance. In some of the insurance industry’s first moves, insurance companies are announcing new insurance policies that cover risks like AI hallucinations and model drift, marking a significant step in AI risk management.\\nIn a move to address the evolving risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), Chaucer Group, a global specialty reinsurance company, has partnered with Armilla AI to launch a new third-party liability (TPL) insurance product. This policy is designed to cover liabilities arising from the mechanical under-performance of AI systems, including issues like AI hallucinations, model drift, and other deviations from expected behavior.\\nUnderstanding the Need for AI Liability Insurance\\nAs AI technologies become increasingly integrated into various industries, the potential for unforeseen failures and associated liabilities has grown. Traditional insurance policies often lack specific provisions for AI-related risks, leaving businesses exposed to significant financial and legal challenges.\\n“At Chaucer, we believe that AI is reshaping the risk landscape, and that requires fresh thinking from the insurance market, \" said Tom Graham, Head of Partnership and Innovation at Chaucer.\\nThe company recently announced a partnership with Armilla AI that enabled them to co-develop a product that “not only recognises the complexities of AI underperformance but provides meaningful coverage that supports innovation, transparency, and accountability,\" as stated by Graham.\\nThe newly launched TPL insurance product offers comprehensive coverage for various AI-related risks such as coverage for false or misleading outputs generated by AI systems, protection against performance degradation of AI models over time, insurance for other deviations from expected AI behavior, and provision for legal defense and liability protection for claims arising from AI under-performance.\\nThis policy is available to U.S.-based clients with global territorial limits, ensuring broad applicability for businesses operating internationally.\\nAI Implications for the Insurance Industry\\nThe introduction of AI-specific liability insurance represents a significant advancement in the insurance industry\\'s approach to emerging technologies. By addressing the unique risks posed by AI, insurers can provide more tailored and effective coverage options for businesses.\\nThe development of Chaucer’s insurance product stems from a collaboration that began when Armilla AI participated in a Lloyd’s Lab cohort focused on Insurtech innovation. Chaucer has actively supported Armilla\\'s growth, including sponsoring its coverholder application at Lloyd’s.\\nThis move also highlights the importance of cross-industry collaboration in developing solutions for complex technological challenges. By combining Chaucer\\'s expertise in insurance with Armilla AI\\'s deep understanding of AI systems, the partnership exemplifies how diverse skill sets can come together to address modern risks.\\nAs Goes Technology, So Too Goes Insurance\\nAs AI continues to evolve and integrate into various sectors, the need for specialized insurance products will likely grow. Businesses adopting AI technologies must consider the potential risks and ensure they have appropriate coverage to mitigate potential liabilities.\\nOther insurance industry firms have announced similar approaches to insuring emerging AI risks. In January 2025, Relm Insurance launched a suite of AI liability insurance products designed to provide tailored coverage for companies developing or integrating AI technologies. These solutions aim to address the unique risks posed by AI, including potential liabilities arising from AI system failures or unintended behaviors.\\nMunich Re offers an AI Warranty Insurance product that enables companies to mitigate risks associated with the underperformance, unreliability, and drift of machine learning models. This coverage is particularly beneficial for businesses that develop or deploy AI solutions, providing financial protection against specific underperformance scenarios.\\nIn early 2024, cyber liability insurer Coalition introduced a policy endorsement aimed at covering risks associated with generative AI technologies. This endorsement addresses potential liabilities stemming from the use or misuse of generative AI, such as data poisoning, infringement, and regulatory violations.\\nInsurance firm AXA also released new endorsements for its cyber insurance policies that specifically addresses risks related to generative AI. This development reflects the evolving nature of AI-related risks and the insurance industry\\'s efforts to provide comprehensive coverage for such emerging threats.\\nNo doubt as the insurance industry seeks to proactively address the challenges posed by emerging technologies, by focusing on coverage for AI-related risks, the insurance industry is helping to support the responsible and confident adoption of AI across industries. As AI becomes more prevalent, such innovative insurance solutions will be crucial in managing the associated risks and ensuring that businesses can harness the benefits of AI with confidence.'}\n",

How do recruiters protect themselves?\\nSocial card description: Some hiring managers are fighting fire with fire and using AI to sort out who might be using the technology for less scrupulous reasons.\\nWhile most job seekers are using artificial intelligence tools for basic help, like assistance writing a cover letter, some may be using the technology to forge documents and create fake resumes, said RJ Frasca, vice president of channels and partnerships at Shield Screening.\\nOne way companies are combating dangerous applications is by fighting fire with fire and using AI in screening platforms to sort out who might be using the technology for less scrupulous reasons. As job candidates are “using more AI to get through filters, [hiring managers] are using more AI to fight those filters,” he said.\\nHere’s what hiring managers need to know.\\nThe AI-enabled candidate problem\\nAI, especially for younger candidates who may be taught how to use generative AI in high school and college, has become part of the job-seeking process. That use is typically harmless, said Joe Jones, director of research and insights for the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a nonprofit that defines, promotes and improves privacy and AI-related professions.\\n“They’re trawling various databases and networks to see what’s available,” said Jones. Others are using it “in a way to generate content to support their application,” like responding to questions, uploading resumes and creating a cover letter template.\\nGenerative AI starts to become a problem when it’s used not as a tool, but the “be all and end all” of the job hunting process, he said, with candidates solely relying on AI to fully write cover letters and resumes that are not personalized, or providing responses to questions that don’t actually answer what is being asked.\\nDeepfake technology, which also relies on AI, has only gotten more convincing. According to a report from finance software provider Medius, just over half (53%) of businesses in the U.S. and U.K. have been targets of a financial scam powered by deepfake technology, with 43% falling victim to such attacks.\\nHR professionals might not think this is their problem, but hiring is a potential entry point for criminals, as they can put themselves onto hiring platforms and steal company software, install malware, or worse.\\nAt the end of 2024, for example, threat intelligence and incident response firm Mandiant warned that North Korea-backed remote IT workers had infiltrated “dozens” of Fortune 100 companies through deepfaked video interviews and stolen personally identifiable information.\\nFighting fire with fire\\nBut AI can help recruiters defend themselves against bad actors, too. Candidate uses AI to make a fake diploma? “There’s a flip side of that, where AI is being used to dig deeper and verify” whatever documents or information candidates are presenting, said Frasca.\\nAI can also be used to verify a candidates’ identity, by doing a live screen of their face and comparing it to a government ID database, he added.\\nOn video calls, AI can be used to detect when the person you’re talking to isn’t really there, or an altered version of someone else. AI can spot patterns “that are more prevalent in deepfakes than in human cases,” said Jones, like eye contact and voice intonations. “There’s all sorts of analysis on the presentation of a person” that can be detected.\\nBut companies shouldn’t just add an AI program or deepfake detector to their platforms, set it and forget it. “The technology’s capabilities need quite a bit of human oversight,” said Frasca, especially if companies are using it for more than just detecting potential fraud, but to sort through candidates and applications.\\nHR departments using AI also need to make sure that “bias doesn’t creep in when the AI is being used,” said Jones. An AI could make inferences in gender, race or other protected characteristics. It could, for example, scan a resume and assume the applicant is a woman, and make inferences about the candidate from that determination. “Bias can creep in — or more than creep,” he said.\\nNotably, job seekers are also wary of employers that rely on AI tools for the hiring process; around 3 in 5 job hunters surveyed by Express Employment Professionals and Harris Poll said they would consider not applying to companies that rely on generative AI.\\nAnd while legislation around AI is still in its infancy, existing laws on things like privacy, copyright and IP are being applied to it, which HR managers should be mindful of. “In the context of AI, privacy laws, quality laws, and nondiscrimination laws still apply,” Jones said.'}\n",

Is it silly to use AI to review it?\\nI'm Daksh, a co-founder of Greptile. Our product uses AI to review pull requests to surface bugs and anti-patterns that humans might miss. Here is an example of what that looks like.\\nRecently, I was curious to see if there exists a power law in the number of PRs opened by individual Greptile users. In other words - were some users opening orders of magnitude more PRs than others? A quick SQL query later, I discovered that there is a power law to this.\\nI also noticed something else very interesting:\\nAt the far left of the long list of GitHub usernames was “devin-ai-integration[bot]”. An AI bot was writing more pull requests than any individual human. [1]\\nSeeing as Devin uses the same LLMs under-the-hood as Greptile, it does raise an interesting question - should the author be the reviewer?\\n[1] Granted that this is somewhat of a technicality. Devin’s contributions across many orgs are being counted in aggregate here. It would be more accurate to treat “Devin @ Company A” and “Devin @ Company B” as separate entries in this chart.\\nShould the Author Be The Reviewer?\\nMost software companies wouldn’t want the PR reviewer to be the same person as the PR author. A large part of why PR reviews happen is to ensure every new piece of code is getting a fresh set of eyes. It seems silly to have Claude Sonnet generate a bunch of code, and then expect Claude Sonnet to find bugs in it.\\nThere are a few counterpoints worth discussing:\\nStatelessness\\nIf you’ve used LLM APIs, you’ll notice that they are stateless. Every inference call is a clean slate request for intelligence. As a result - asking an LLM to review its own code is looking at it with a fresh set of eyes.\\nScaffolding\\nScaffolding refers generally to the specific workflows that a tool uses to wrap the LLM call to allow it to do the task at hand. For an AI code reviewer it might be the set of steps it takes to review a diff, checking for bugs, formulating comments, and finally self-assessing comment severity, plus the context retrieval along the way to ensure it’s looking at the relevant docs files and other code files in the codebase. For Devin, it likely is just as complex and completely different. In other words, the reviewer is in fact materially different from the author. These are two distinct cars that just happen to have the same engine.\\nHow different are two humans, really?\\nIn a pre-AI world, the author and reviewer of a PR are two distinct people. However, they contain the same intelligence at their core, not unlike two AI tools. Not only do they share a functionally identical brain from a biological standpoint, they even have shared knowledge since they are both trained engineers and shared context since they are coworkers at the same company.\\nAI-Generated Code Needs Closer Reviewing\\nAI code isn’t slop, but it is a little sloppy\\nThere is no doubt that AI has made programmers faster and more effective. That said, in my opinion, AI has reduced the average quality of the code that good engineers write. This is not strictly because the models produce worse code than good engineers. It’s because:\\n- Prompting is an imperfect and lossy way to communicate requirements to AI\\n- Engineers underestimate the degree to which this is true, and don’t carefully review AI-generated code to the degree to which they would review their own.\\nThe reason for #2 isn’t complacency, one can review code at the speed at which they can think and type, but not at the speed at which an LLM can generate.When you’re typing code, you review-as-you-go, when you AI-generate the code, you don’t.\\nInterestingly, the inverse is true for mediocre engineers, for whom AI actually improves the quality of the code they produce. AI simply makes good and bad engineers converge on the same median as they rely on it more heavily.\\nHumans are bad at catching the types of bugs that AI introduces\\nAI-generated code generally contains more bugs. Moreover, these bugs are not the type humans would introduce. How often have you found a Cursor’s “Apply” function changed a line of code you didn’t expect it would change, and you didn’t notice until later? How many of those bugs were things you could see yourself introducing without AI?\\nMoreover, PR review is not a great way to catch bugs. Humans just aren’t that good at detecting them, so PR review tends to be more of a style/pattern enforcement exercise, and on occasion an architecture review.\\nOddly, it turns out AI is actually much better than humans at finding bugs in code. During our tests, we found the newest Anthropic Sonnet model correctly identified 32 out of the 209 bugs in the “hard” category of our bug finding benchmark. For reference, none of the highly skilled engineers at Greptile could identify more than 5-7.\\nNote that 32/209 isn’t great either, it’s just better than the human developer.\\nJust In: Used Car Salesman Sincerely Feels You Need A Used Car\\nDisclaimer in case it wasn’t clear - we sell an AI code reviewer, so take what you will from this. This isn’t an exercise in intellectual dishonesty that exists to persuade you to buy, it’s the earnest attempt at intellectual honesty that led us to work on AI code review in the first place.\"}\n",

Or as the report puts it: \"A lack of clarity about future demand makes precise investment calculations difficult.\"\\nWill hyperscalers continue shouldering the cost burden, McKinsey asks, or will enterprises, governments, and financial institutions step in with new financing models? Will demand for datacenters continue to rise, lifted by a surge in AI usage, or will it fall as technical advances make AI less resource-intensive?\\nOne question left unasked in the report: What happens if AI turns out to be useful for certain specific tasks, but not the general-purpose magic bullet that many corporate leaders believe will automate many of their business processes and let them save big on costs – mainly by eliminating human workers?\\nFor example, a working paper released earlier this month found that generative AI has had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation so far, despite the billions poured into building and training the models.\\nMoving into actual numerical projections for AI, the report forecasts that global demand for compute capacity could almost triple by 2030, with about 70 percent of that demand coming from AI workloads. However, this depends on two factors: whether enterprises can turn AI into something with real business impact, and whether advances in technology significantly enhance compute efficiency.\\nThe first would lead to increased demand for infrastructure, but the second would tend to lessen it – unless, as McKinsey reasons, any efficiency gains are offset by increased usage across the broader AI market – otherwise known as the Jevons paradox.\\nTo cover itself, the company has therefore envisioned three scenarios for 2030, from \"constrained demand\" through \"continued demand\" to \"accelerated demand.\" The first would see an extra 78 GW of capacity added for a total capex of $3.7 trillion, while the mid-range involves 124 GW of capacity for a total of $5.2 trillion. (Additional capex required for traditional IT apps would amount to $1.5 trillion, leading to the nearly $7 trillion in total expenditure cited in the title of the report.) Accelerated demand for AI, meanwhile, would bring an extra 205 GW of capacity online at a cost of $7.9 trillion in capex just for AI.\\n- Generative AI is not replacing jobs or hurting wages at all, say economists\\n- Tech hiring stalls as AI hype, layoffs, tariffs, economic uncertainty, more collide\\n- After Copilot trial, government staff rated Microsoft\\'s AI less useful than expected\\n- When it comes to AI ROI, IT decision-makers not convinced\\nBut McKinsey claims that current investment levels from potential end customers are lagging behind these projections. It says dozens of client interviews revealed that CEOs are unsurprisingly hesitant to invest in compute capacity at maximum levels, because they have limited visibility into future demand. They are unsure whether large capex sums spent on AI infrastructure today will actually produce any measurable return on investment in the future.\\nNone of this is stopping big money from pouring into datacenter buildouts. A report from law firm DLA Piper last year found that 70 percent of financiers, consultants, and operators expect to see AI datacenter funding continue to rise, despite growing concerns about the availability of power to supply those projects.\\nOne reason is that the projected returns are currently favorable compared to other areas of the economy, as Digital Realty senior VP Fabrice Coquio told The Register last month, and this is drawing in investors without prior experience in the bit barn sector.\\n\"In the UK, in France, in Germany, you\\'ve got people coming from nowhere having no experiences ... that have no idea about what AI and datacenters are really, and still investing in them,\" Coquio said, describing it as \"a typical bubble.\"\\nMcKinsey advises that companies need to assess AI computing needs early, anticipate potential shifts in demand, and design scalable investment strategies that can adapt as AI models and use cases evolve.\\nStriking the right balance between growth and capital efficiency will be critical, it says. ®'}\n",

However, for public image scenarios such as reputation management, model behaviors were more ambiguous.\\nA real-world example hit the news this week when OpenAI rolled back a training update that made its GPT-4o model into a sycophant that flattered its users to the point of dishonesty.

However, while multiple Ukrainian students study English, many do not yet have sufficient command of the language to be able to fully understand and use the often very technical and complex OpenCourseWare content and materials.\\n“At my school, I saw firsthand how language barriers prevented many Ukrainian students from accessing world-class education,” says Lipkevych.\\nShe was able to address this challenge as a participant in the Ukrainian Leadership and Technology Academy (ULTA), established by Ukrainian MIT students Dima Yanovsky and Andrii Zahorodnii. During summer 2024 at ULTA, Lipkevych worked on a browser extension that translated YouTube videos in real-time. Since MIT OpenCourseWare was a main source of learning materials for students participating in ULTA, she was inspired to translate OpenCourseWare lectures directly and to have this translation widely available on the OpenCourseWare website and YouTube channel. She reached out to Professor Elizabeth Wood, founding director of the MIT Ukraine Program, who connected her with MIT OpenCourseWare Director Curt Newton.\\nAlthough there had been some translations of MIT OpenCourseWare’s educational resources available beginning in 2004, these initial translations were conducted manually by several global partners, without the efficiencies of the latest artificial intelligence tools, and over time the programs couldn’t be sustained, and shut down.\\n“We were thrilled to have this contact with ULTA,” says Newton. “We’ve been missing having a vibrant translation community, and we are excited to have a ‘phase 2’ of translations emerge.”\\nThe ULTA team selected courses to translate based on demand among Ukrainian students, focusing on foundational subjects that are prerequisites for advanced learning — particularly those for which high-quality, Ukrainian-language materials are scarce. Starting with caption translations on videos of lectures, the team has translated the following courses so far: 18.06 (Linear Algebra), 2.003SC (Engineering Dynamics), 5.60 (Thermodynamics & Kinetics), 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms), and 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python). They also worked directly with Andy Eskenazi, a PhD student in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, to translate 16.002 (How to CAD Almost Anything - Siemens NX Edition).\\nThe ULTA team developed multiple tools to help break language barriers. For MIT OpenCourseWare’s PDF content available through the ULTA program, they created a specialized tool that uses optical character recognition to recognize LaTeX in documents — such as problem sets and other materials — and then used a few large language models to translate them, all while maintaining technical accuracy. The team built a glossary of technical terms used in the courses and their corresponding Ukrainian translations, to help make sure that the wording was correct and consistent. Each translation also undergoes human review to further ensure accuracy and high quality.\\nFor video content, the team initially created a browser extension that can translate YouTube video captions in real-time. They ultimately collaborated with ElevenLabs, implementing their advanced AI dubbing editor that preserves the original speaker's tone, pace, and emotional delivery. The lectures are translated in the ElevenLabs dubbing editor, and then the audio is uploaded to the MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel.\\nThe team is currently finalizing the translation of the audio for class 9.13 (The Human Brain), taught by MIT Professor Nancy Kanwisher, which Lipkevych says they selected for its interdisciplinary nature and appeal to a wide variety of learners.\\nThis Ukrainian translation project highlights the transformative potential of the latest translation technologies, building upon a 2023 MIT OpenCourseWare experiment using the Google Aloud AI dubbing prototype on a few courses, including MIT Professor Patrick Winston’s How to Speak.

Amazon says that Premier excels at “complex tasks” that “require deep understanding of context, multi-step planning, and precise execution across multiple tools and data sources.”\\nAmazon announced its Nova lineup of models in December at its annual AWS re:Invent conference. Over the last few months, the company has expanded the collection with image- and video-generating models as well as with audio understanding and agentic, task-performing releases.\\nNova Premier, which has a context length of 1 million tokens, meaning it can analyze around 750,000 words in one go, is weaker on certain benchmarks than flagship models from rival AI companies such as Google. On SWE-Bench Verified, a coding test, Premier is behind Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and it also performs poorly on benchmarks measuring math and science knowledge, GPQA Diamond and AIME 2025.\\nHowever, in bright spots for Premier, the model does well on tests for knowledge retrieval and visual understanding, SimpleQA and MMMU, according to Amazon’s internal benchmarking.\\nIn Bedrock, Premier is priced at $2.50 per 1 million tokens fed into the model and $12.50 per 1 million tokens generated by the model. That’s around the same price as Gemini 2.5 Pro, which costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.\\nImportantly, Premier isn’t a “reasoning” model. As opposed to models like OpenAI’s o4-mini and DeepSeek’s R1, it can’t take additional time and computing to carefully consider and fact-check its answers to questions.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

In March, the Denver-based firm added Adaptive AI, a platform that automates data capture and basic bookkeeping, to its technology stack after a monthslong security review, principal Bill Mills said.\\n“The tool is exactly what we’re looking for, which is taking the human element out of the transactional process,” Mills told PYMNTS. By letting algorithms post invoices and reconcile ledgers, Pinion expects to free staff accountants to spend more time interpreting results and advising clients.\\nEarly returns have impressed one hard-to-please constituency: home builders and construction contractors. Preparing loan-draw packages for banks “has historically been a paper-driven bane for everyone involved,” Mills said.\\nAdaptive’s workflow plugs into field apps and the firm’s cloud ledger, generating digital loan documents that borrower and lender can review in real time. The shift, he added, “is a door-opener” when pitching new clients and has begun to shorten approval cycles.\\nAccounting firms have long worried that AI still needs too much human oversight to be reliable, especially in regulated services. Mills conceded the learning curve is steep. “The hurdle is education — unwinding work habits and conveying the benefit,” he said. But he argues that machine efficiency outweighs the adjustment costs, citing Adaptive’s ability to deliver “better, faster, more reliable information at lower cost.”\\nNext on Pinion’s roadmap is automated, industry-specific reporting that turns raw data into customizable dashboards. Perfecting that loop, Mills said, would leave advisers to “interpret, explain and plan,” moving them further up the value chain even as software handles the grunt work.\\nPinion’s early experience comes as Adaptive this week rolled out what it calls its next-generation platform for construction accounting, a segment the company estimates includes nearly 100,000 U.S. contractors with combined revenue of about $850 billion.\\nThe privately held firm says its latest release was built with input from design partners including CliftonLarsonAllen and Pinion and is aimed squarely at helping accounting practices scale construction services without adding staff.\\nUnlike generic AI tools that attempt to automate bookkeeping across industries, Adaptive’s software is designed around construction’s idiosyncrasies like job-cost coding, draw management and the maze of lien waivers and insurance certificates that accompany each project.\\n“Accounting firms know construction is a growth opportunity, but the manual processes have put a ceiling on how many clients they can serve,” Adaptive Chief Executive Matt Calvano said. The new version, he added, “removes that ceiling” by standardizing workflows firms typically build from scratch for each client.\\nThe vendor’s pitch comes at a moment when many midtier and regional firms are reevaluating their service mix. Tight labor markets and rising audit-quality expectations have pushed practices toward recurring, advisory-heavy offerings. Automating the labor-intensive portions of bookkeeping, practitioners say, is a prerequisite for that shift.\\n“Our partnership with Adaptive has enabled us to deliver exceptionally fast and meaningful outcomes for our construction clients,” Pinion principal Lisa Baalman said, citing quicker turnaround on financial statements and improved visibility into cash flow.\\nAdaptive’s software integrates with QuickBooks, major U.S. banks and project-management systems such as Procore. Once connected, it reads invoices, assigns costs to jobs and cost codes, and routes payment applications through a web portal. Accounts receivable, accounts payable and expense tracking modules feed real-time work-in-progress reports, while a compliance module monitors insurance expirations and lien waivers.\\nImplementation, according to the company, requires two or three remote training sessions and comes with a white-label option so firms can present the portal under their own brand. Adaptive also offers daily webinars and live-chat support — features that help smaller firms lacking dedicated IT staff.\\nStill, accountants caution that no amount of automation eliminates professional responsibility. Construction bookkeeping is notoriously detail-oriented; a misclassified cost can cascade into flawed revenue recognition. Regulators have also begun to scrutinize how firms validate AI outputs, raising the prospect of new guidance on documentation and internal controls.\\nAdaptive’s approach — pairing automation with firm-level onboarding and support — may mitigate some of those concerns. Yet the broader question is how quickly accounting practices can adapt their own processes and billing models. Mills expects a period of dual-running systems before staff and clients fully trust the software. “We’re rolling it out in phases,” he said. “Accuracy has to be proven over time.”\\nFor firms willing to take the plunge, the payoff could be significant. Automating data entry and reconciliation typically cuts per-client servicing hours by 25% to 40%, according to estimates from consultancy CPA.com. That capacity can be redeployed to higher-margin advisory work — forecasting, tax planning or securing financing — services construction companies often lack in-house.\\nPinion, for its part, is content to let the market develop while it measures internal results. “We’ll evaluate labor savings and data accuracy over the next quarter,” Mills said. If the numbers hold, he expects to migrate the majority of the firm’s construction clients to the platform by year-end.\\nThe new Saks on Amazon storefront offers the curated shopping experience and luxury fashion and beauty items associated with Saks Fifth Avenue together with the convenience and fast shipping offered by Amazon, Amazon said in a Thursday (May 1) blog post.\\nThis new offering is the latest addition to the Luxury Stores that Amazon launched in 2020, according to the post.\\n“Customers can also browse the launch assortment through digital window displays available in the Saks on Amazon experience,” the post said. “Inspired by the iconic windows at the Saks Fifth Avenue New York flagship, these digital displays allow customers to ‘window shop’ the Saks on Amazon storefront, with the added convenience of instantly adding items to their cart.”\\nAmazon and Saks launched the new luxury storefront on Tuesday (April 29), saying that it will enhance access to luxury fashion and beauty.\\nThe storefront will feature product arrays that are regularly refreshed to offer new and trending products, the companies said in a Tuesday press release.\\n“This collaboration underscores Saks Fifth Avenue’s reputation as a leader in luxury curation, as well as our commitment to reinventing luxury shopping so that each customer’s experience is unmistakably their own,” Saks Global President and Chief Commercial Officer Emily Essner said in the release.\\nJenny Freshwater, vice president of Amazon Fashion, Fitness and Creators, said in the release: “This collaboration with Saks furthers Amazon’s commitment to supporting the luxury industry and increasing our assortment for customers, while maintaining an elevated shopping experience that meets the varying tastes of our diverse customer base.”\\nIt was reported in July that Amazon was taking a minority stake in Saks Global, the new company that would be created when Saks Fifth Avenue parent company HBC bought rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus.\\nShortly after the acquisition was announced, Marc Metrick, who was CEO of Saks’ online operations at the time and later become the CEO of Saks Global, said Amazon’s tech would help the luxury retailers thrive.\\n“How do you future-proof a brand like Saks or Neimans or Bergdorf? You do that through technology,” Metrick said.\\nFor Amazon, the minority stake in Saks Global may provide “a ringside seat into the ins and outs of a retail category where Amazon doesn’t have much of a presence right now — but could over the next five years,” PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster wrote in an article posted July 11.'}\n",

On one hand, IDC reports an expected shortage of 4 million full-time developers in 2025. On the other, some prominent companies have announced a pause on developer hiring, indicating they believe AI will address many developer needs. In that regard, the question becomes whether today’s developers possess the right skills in an AI-first world.\\nThese challenges don’t just impact tech companies. Software is the backbone of every industry and every company. Without skilled developers in place, companies risk slowing their innovation and hindering their overall market growth.\\nTo combat the developer skills shortage, there are short-term and long-term solutions available. In the short term, many companies are betting on AI to quickly increase their developer efficiency and empower business users. AI-powered tools and platforms can accelerate learning by providing personalized training, offering real-time feedback, creating documentation and automating repetitive tasks. In the long term, businesses are investing in training the next generation of developers.\\nBoth solutions play a pivotal role in addressing the talent-gap of skilled developers.\\nCode more efficiently with AI and empower your workforce\\nAI enables developers of all skill levels to become more efficient. By automating repetitive, mundane tasks such as debugging errors and sample data generation, senior developers can focus their time on creative, higher-level problem solving. AI is a game changer for early-career developers, too, as it can offer code explanation, personalized learnings and hands-on experience without the pressure of overly complex environments.\\nCompanies can implement these types of AI features by adopting application development and automation solutions. SAP Build, for example, offers a comprehensive suite of low-code, code-first and generative AI tools on the SAP Business Technology Platform, which makes it easy for companies to accelerate application development, streamline their workflows and reduce costs. A recent GigaOm study reported that customers who use SAP Build increased their developer velocity by 3x and achieved a 59% reduction in development effort and resource requirements compared to using multiple developer tools for custom development.\\nAI-powered capabilities uniquely understand development frameworks and leverage large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for their workloads. This enables developers to deliver precise, contextualized outcomes and accelerate coding and code-first/no-code–based application development. For SAP Build, embedded features such as automated code generation and code optimization, means development teams finish projects in less than half the time.\\nIn addition to AI-powered tools, companies are equipping their business users with low-code capabilities to quickly create applications and extensions. In doing so, the people closest to the business can quickly innovate.\\nTake thyssenkrupp AG for example. Their citizen developers utilized SAP Build to develop and launch a social media recruiting channel, aimed at attracting, recruiting and evaluating candidates for difficult-to-fill positions. This new administration cockpit application allowed HR teams to design and deploy custom survey questionnaires and manage workflows for different HR applications, leading to positive outcomes of improved candidate quality, time saved in the recruiting process and greater agility to adapt to evolving recruitment needs.\\nAddressing the developer skills shortage\\nA recent World Economic Forum report noted 44% of employees’ core skills are expected to change in the next five years. While AI continues to reshape industries and transform businesses, the need to train and upskill the next generation of developers remains evident. Organizations are considering how to drive reskilling and upskilling, data-driven decision-making and continuous learning at scale.\\nWith this goal in mind, AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how we learn and grow. Gone are the days of traditional classroom-based developer training methods. In its place — hands-on AI-platforms that can create customized learning paths, tailored to a developer’s skill level and progress, ensuring they receive the most relevant and effective training. Developers can learn best practices and avoid common mistakes in real time thanks to AI chatbots, predictive ghost-text coding suggestions and recommended improvements on code.\\nAt SAP, learners can make use of a vast offering of courses on our Learning site where learning journeys, like those for SAP Build, equip developers with tools for AI-enhanced application development, emphasizing productivity and innovation.\\nWith learning and AI tools for coding, companies can mitigate the impact of this shortage and ensure that every industry continues to thrive. Embracing AI-driven solutions will not only help bridge the gap but also pave the way for innovative breakthroughs and sustained growth.\\nMichael Ameling is SAP’s chief product officer for Business Technology Platform\\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Learn More\\nChinese e-commerce and cloud giant Alibaba isn’t taking the pressure off other AI model providers in the U.S. and abroad.\\nJust days after releasing its new, state-of-the-art open source Qwen3 large reasoning model family, Alibaba’s Qwen team today released Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, a lightweight version of its preceding multimodal model architecture designed to run on consumer-grade hardware without sacrificing broad functionality across text, audio, image, and video inputs.\\nQwen2.5-Omni-3B is a scaled-down, 3-billion-parameter variant of the team’s flagship 7 billion parameter (7B) model. (Recall parameters refer to the number of settings governing the model’s behavior and functionality, with more typically denoting more powerful and complex models).\\nWhile smaller in size, the 3B version retains over 90% of the larger model’s multimodal performance and delivers real-time generation in both text and natural-sounding speech.\\nA major improvement comes in GPU memory efficiency. The team reports that Qwen2.5-Omni-3B reduces VRAM usage by over 50% when processing long-context inputs of 25,000 tokens. With optimized settings, memory consumption drops from 60.2 GB (7B model) to just 28.2 GB (3B model), enabling deployment on 24GB GPUs commonly found in high-end desktops and laptop computers — instead of the larger dedicated GPU clusters or workstations found in enterprises.\\nAccording to the developers, it achieves this through architectural features such as the Thinker-Talker design and a custom position embedding method, TMRoPE, which aligns video and audio inputs for synchronized comprehension.\\nHowever, the licensing terms specify for research only — meaning enterprises cannot use the model to build commercial products unless they obtain a separate license from Alibaba’s Qwen Team, first.\\nThe announcement follows increasing demand for more deployable multimodal models and is accompanied by performance benchmarks showing competitive results relative to larger models in the same series.\\nThe model is now freely available for download from:\\nDevelopers can integrate the model into their pipelines using Hugging Face Transformers, Docker containers, or Alibaba’s vLLM implementation. Optional optimizations such as FlashAttention 2 and BF16 precision are supported for enhanced speed and reduced memory consumption.\\nBenchmark performance shows strong results even approaching much larger parameter models\\nDespite its reduced size, Qwen2.5-Omni-3B performs competitively across key benchmarks:\\n| Task | Qwen2.5-Omni-3B | Qwen2.5-Omni-7B |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| OmniBench (multimodal reasoning) | 52.2 | 56.1 |\\n| VideoBench (audio understanding) | 68.8 | 74.1 |\\n| MMMU (image reasoning) | 53.1 | 59.2 |\\n| MVBench (video reasoning) | 68.7 | 70.3 |\\n| Seed-tts-eval test-hard (speech generation) | 92.1 | 93.5 |\\nThe narrow performance gap in video and speech tasks highlights the efficiency of the 3B model’s design, particularly in areas where real-time interaction and output quality matter most.\\nReal-time speech, voice customization, and more\\nQwen2.5-Omni-3B supports simultaneous input across modalities and can generate both text and audio responses in real time.\\nThe model includes voice customization features, allowing users to choose between two built-in voices—Chelsie (female) and Ethan (male)—to suit different applications or audiences.\\nUsers can configure whether to return audio or text-only responses, and memory usage can be further reduced by disabling audio generation when not needed.\\nCommunity and ecosystem growth\\nThe Qwen team emphasizes the open-source nature of its work, providing toolkits, pretrained checkpoints, API access, and deployment guides to help developers get started quickly.\\nThe release also follows recent momentum for the Qwen2.5-Omni series, which has reached top rankings on Hugging Face’s trending model list.\\nJunyang Lin from the Qwen team commented on the motivation behind the release on X, stating, “While a lot of users hope for smaller Omni model for deployment we then build this.”\\nWhat it means for enterprise technical decision-makers\\nFor enterprise decision makers responsible for AI development, orchestration, and infrastructure strategy, the release of Qwen2.5-Omni-3B may appear, at first glance, like a practical leap forward. A compact, multimodal model that performs competitively against its 7B sibling while running on 24GB consumer GPUs offers real promise in terms of operational feasibility. But as with any open-source technology, licensing matters—and in this case, the license draws a firm boundary between exploration and deployment.\\nThe Qwen2.5-Omni-3B model is licensed for non-commercial use only under Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen Research License Agreement. That means organizations can evaluate the model, benchmark it, or fine-tune it for internal research purposes—but cannot deploy it in commercial settings, such as customer-facing applications or monetized services, without first securing a separate commercial license from Alibaba Cloud.\\nFor professionals overseeing AI model lifecycles—whether deploying across customer environments, orchestrating at scale, or integrating multimodal tools into existing pipelines—this restriction introduces important considerations. It may shift Qwen2.5-Omni-3B’s role from a deployment-ready solution to a testbed for feasibility, a way to prototype or evaluate multimodal interactions before deciding whether to license commercially or pursue an alternative.\\nThose in orchestration and ops roles may still find value in piloting the model for internal use cases—like refining pipelines, building tooling, or preparing benchmarks—so long as it remains within research bounds. Data engineers or security leaders might likewise explore the model for internal validation or QA tasks, but should tread carefully when considering its use with proprietary or customer data in production environments.\\nThe real takeaway here may be about access and constraint: Qwen2.5-Omni-3B lowers the technical and hardware barrier to experimenting with multimodal AI, but its current license enforces a commercial boundary. In doing so, it offers enterprise teams a high-performance model for testing ideas, evaluating architectures, or informing make-vs-buy decisions—yet reserves production use for those willing to engage Alibaba for a licensing discussion.\\nIn this context, Qwen2.5-Omni-3B becomes less a plug-and-play deployment option and more a strategic evaluation tool—a way to get closer to multimodal AI with fewer resources, but not yet a turnkey solution for production.'}\n",

Those tiers are detailed here; China is in tier three.\\nCountries lucky enough to fall into the first tier would retain unfettered access to American-designed accelerators, while nations in the second would be subject to strict import limits. Countries finding themselves in the third tier, meanwhile, would effectively be blocked from buying said chips — unless they could convince Uncle Sam to grant an exception.\\nHowever, as we pointed out at the start of the year, the Trump administration would make the final call whether to move forward. Anthropic is urging the Trump administration to go even further.\\n\"The US currently leads in advanced semiconductor technology and export controls capitalize on the trend of computing power doubling every two years, so while US chip technology continues advancing, China\\'s progress is slowed,\" Anthropic argued in its note alongside a formal submission [PDF] to the US Department of Commerce.\\n\"This growing efficiency gap means that by 2027, countries using older chips could face AI training costs that are ten times higher than those with cutting-edge American technology.\"\\nWhat\\'s Anthropic after\\nAnthropic wants the tiers reworked. In particular, it hopes to see the Trump administration slash the amount of compute tier-2 nations are allowed to buy without talking to Uncle Sam first.\\n\"Currently, countries in tier two can buy the equivalent of 1,700 Nvidia H100 advanced chips without needing government permission — roughly $40 million worth of technology. This creates a potential loophole for smuggling,\" the LLM lab wrote.\\nThat said, it\\'s in favor of increasing the allocation to tier-two countries as long as they have \"robust\" datacenter security and use \"government-to-government agreements that prevent smuggling and align technology controls.\"\\nFinally, Anthropic suggests the Trump administration should increase funding for export enforcement. \"Enhanced resources for the Bureau of Industry and Security would significantly improve control effectiveness.\"\\nNot everyone is on board\\nAnthropic\\'s stance stands in stark contrast to American chip designers, most notably Nvidia, which has already lost billions in revenue to US export controls.\\nAlso on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just so happened to call on the Trump administration to loosen restrictions on the sale of AI infrastructure outside the US.\\n\"We need to accelerate the diffusion of American AI technology around the world,\" Huang said in a press briefing. \"The policies and encouragement from the administration really need to support that.\"\\nNvidia is by far the largest supplier of AI infrastructure in the world, with its GPUs powering the vast majority of training and inference deployments today. As such, it stands to lose the most should the Trump administration tighten the AI diffusion rules, as Anthropic suggests.\\nHuang\\'s efforts to convince Trump to loosen the rules, which reportedly included attending a $1 million-a-head dinner with the President at Mar-a-Lago, apparently aren\\'t playing out the way the GPU supremo hoped.\\nEarlier this month the chip goliath booked a $5.5 billion charge tied to newly implemented export controls on the sale of H20 accelerators to China, including Hong Kong, and other nations of concern. Revenues lost to US export controls are likely to grow considerably should the Trump administration push ahead with the rules.\\nThe Reg comment\\nAnthropic\\'s stance on US trade policy might seem like a strange and potentially risky play given Nvidia\\'s dominant position in the AI ecosystem. It sure would be a shame if something happened to their allocation, right?\\nHowever, Anthropic is far less reliant on Nvidia\\'s hardware than most of its competitors. The California lab maintains a close relationship with Amazon Web Services — one of its largest backers — and makes extensive use of its custom Trainium AI accelerators to develop of its Claude family of models. (Incidentally, Amazon was said to have suffered an internal GPU usage crunch in 2024.)\\nLate last year, AWS revealed Project Rainier, an AI supercomputer containing hundreds of thousands of its Trainium2 accelerators, set to power on this year and provide Anthropic with \"5x the number of exaFLOPS used to train its latest generation of AI models.\"\\n- Your graphics card\\'s so fat, it\\'s got its own gravity alert\\n- Trump derails Chinese H20 GPU sales, forcing Nvidia to eat $5.5B this quarter\\n- Nvidia joins made-in-America party, hopes to flog $500B in homegrown AI supers by 2029\\n- Intel tweaks its 18A process with variants tailored to mass-market chips, big AI brains\\nStifling Chinese progress in AI is arguably more important to Anthropic than getting on Huang\\'s bad side. The release of China\\'s DeepSeek R1 back in January shook the AI industry to its core. The base model from which the LLM was derived was said to be trained using much less, but still significant, compute required by its Western competitors.\\nSince then, Chinese cloud providers and model builders have continued to pump out ever-more competitive models such as Alibaba\\'s Qwen 2.5 Max, QwQ, and this week a whole zoo of Qwen 3 models.\\nBut it\\'s not just China. The US AI diffusion rules are likely to disrupt the supply of AI accelerators to much of the developed world, which means Anthropic, OpenAI, and other American model builders will face less competition and are less likely to suffer embarrassment at the hands of other nations as well.\\nIt seems that Anthropic may just get its wish. Earlier today, Reuters, citing several persons \"familiar with the matter\" reported that the White House was weighing whether to do away with the three-tier split and negotiate with world governments for a share of US accelerators on a one-on-one basis, making the accelerators yet another bargaining chip in Trump\\'s arsenal. ®\\nUpdated to add on May 1\\nNvidia has been in touch to say China is more than capable of competing with the US without needing to smuggle its GPUs.\\n\"China, with half of the world\\'s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told El Reg in response to Anthropic\\'s note.\\n\"America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI. American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in \\'baby bumps\\' or \\'alongside live lobsters\\'.\"\\nNv is referring to Anthropic\\'s Dept of Commerce submission that stated:\\nWhile existing country-specific export controls are foundational to maintaining America’s compute advantage, they are increasingly coming under strain. Smugglers have employed creative methods to circumvent export controls, including hiding processors in prosthetic baby bumps and packing GPUs alongside live lobsters.\\nWethinks Nvidia doth protest too much. A spokesperson for Anthropic shot back:\\nNational security is bigger than the interest of any single company. Anthropic stands by its recently filed public submission in support of strong and balanced export controls that help secure America’s lead in infrastructure development and ensure that the values of freedom and democracy shape the future of AI.\\nIt’s critical we deal with the well-documented issue of shell companies, smuggling, and other illegal loopholes that ultimately strengthen China’s position.'}\n",

In related news, Anthropic has also upped the rate limits for its AI-powered coding tool, Claude Code, for Max customers.\\nIntegrations and Advanced Research are both a part of Anthropic’s effort to keep pace with competing chatbots like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Anthropic reportedly hopes to reach $34.5 billion in revenue in 2027, and while it’s certainly making inroads, it has a long way to go. Anthropic’s annualized revenue was around $1.4 billion in early March, according to one report.\\nIntegrations builds on the company’s MCP protocol, which lets AI models draw data from sources such as business tools to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. Integrations taps MCP to allow developers to create and host app servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities and let users discover and connect these servers to Claude.\\n“When you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work — understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge — and can take actions across every surface,” wrote Anthropic in a blog post.\\nTo start, there are a number of Integrations from Anthropic partners, including Atlassian, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Square, and PayPal. Each expands what Claude can do. For example, the Atlassian Integration lets Claude summarize and create pages in Atlassian’s Confluence workplace software, while the Zapier Integration allows Claude to connect to the former’s app automation workflows.\\nAs for the other new Claude feature launching today, Advanced Research, it allows Claude to crawl “hundreds” of internal and external sources to deliver what Anthropic describes as “more comprehensive” reports on a topic in anywhere from five to 45 minutes.

Learn More\\nAstronomer, the company behind the Apache Airflow-powered data orchestration platform Astro, has secured $93 million in Series D funding as enterprises increasingly seek to operationalize AI initiatives through better management of their data pipelines.\\nThe funding round was led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock. Bosch Ventures is also seeking to participate in the round, reflecting industrial interest in the technology.\\nIn an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, Astronomer CEO Andy Byron explained that the company will use the funding to expedite research and development efforts and expand its global footprint, particularly in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.\\n“For us, this is just a step along the way,” Byron said. “We want to build something awesome here. I couldn’t be more excited about our venture partners, our customers, our product vision, which I think is super strong in going after collapsing the data ops market.”\\nHow data orchestration became the hidden key to enterprise AI success\\nThe funding targets what industry analysts have identified as the “AI implementation gap” — the significant technical and organizational hurdles that prevent companies from deploying AI at scale. Data orchestration, the process of automating and coordinating complex data workflows across disparate systems, has become an essential component of successful AI deployments.\\nEnrique Salem, Partner at Bain Capital Ventures, explained the critical challenges facing enterprises today: “Every company operates a sprawling, fragmented data ecosystem—using a patchworks of tools, teams, and workflows that struggle to deliver reliable insights, creating operational bottlenecks and limiting agility. At the heart of this complexity is orchestration—the layer that coordinates all these moving pieces.”\\nSalem noted that despite its importance, “today’s orchestration landscape is where cloud infrastructure was 15 years ago: mission critical, yet fragmented, brittle and often built in-house with limited scalability. Data engineers spend more time maintaining pipelines than driving innovation. Without robust orchestration, data is unreliable, agility is lost, and businesses fall behind.”\\nThe company’s platform, Astro, is built on Apache Airflow, an open-source framework that has seen explosive growth. According to the company’s recently released State of Airflow 2025 report, which surveyed over 5,000 data practitioners, Airflow was downloaded more than 324 million times in 2024 alone — more than all previous years combined.\\n“Airflow has established itself as the proven de facto standard for data pipeline orchestration,” Astronomer SVP of Marketing Mark Wheeler explained. “When we look at the competitive landscape in the orchestration layer, Airflow has clearly emerged as the standard solution for moving modern data efficiently from source to destination.”\\nFrom invisible plumbing to enterprise AI backbone: The evolution of data infrastructure\\nAstronomer’s growth reflects a transformative shift in how enterprises view data orchestration — from hidden backend infrastructure to mission-critical technology that enables AI initiatives and drives business value.\\n“BCV’s belief in Astronomer goes way back. We invested in the company’s seed round in 2019 and have supported the company over the years, now culminating in leading their Series D,” Salem said. “Beyond the impressive growth, Astronomer’s data orchestration has become even more important in the age of AI, which requires scalable orchestration and model deployment automation amidst a ballooning sea of data tools that don’t talk to each other.”\\nAccording to the company’s internal data, 69% of customers who have used its platform for two or more years are using Airflow for AI and machine learning applications. This adoption rate is significantly higher than the broader Airflow community, suggesting that Astronomer’s managed service accelerates enterprise AI deployments.\\nThe company has seen 150% year-over-year growth in Astro (managed SaaS platform) annual recurring revenue and boasts a 130% net revenue retention rate, indicating strong customer expansion.\\n“While market analysts may be looking for a clear winner in the cloud data platforms battle, enterprises have clearly chosen a multi-solution strategy—just like they earlier determined that multi-cloud would far outpace standardization on any single cloud provider,” Wheeler explained. “Leading enterprises refuse to lock into a single vendor, opting for multi-cloud and diverse data platform approaches to stay agile and take advantage of the latest innovations.”\\nInside Ford’s massive AI operation: How petabytes of weekly data power next-generation vehicles\\nMajor enterprises are already leveraging Astronomer’s platform for sophisticated AI use cases that would be challenging to implement without robust orchestration.\\nAt Ford Motor Company, Astronomer’s platform powers the company’s Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and its multi-million dollar “Mach1ML” machine learning operations platform.\\nThe automotive giant processes more than one petabyte of data weekly and runs over 300 parallel workflows, balancing CPU- and GPU-intensive tasks for AI model development across a hybrid public/private cloud platform. These workflows power everything from autonomous driving systems to Ford’s specialized FordLLM platform for large language models.\\nFord initially built its MLOps platform using Kubeflow for orchestration but encountered significant challenges, including a steep learning curve and tight integration with Google Cloud, which limited flexibility. After transitioning to Airflow for Mach1ML 2.0, Ford reports dramatically streamlined workflows and seamless integration across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.\\nFrom AI experiments to production: How orchestration bridges the implementation divide\\nA common challenge for enterprises is moving AI from proof-of-concept to production. According to Astronomer’s research, organizations that establish strong data orchestration foundations are more successful at operationalizing AI.\\n“As more enterprises are running ML workflows and real-time AI pipelines, they require scalable orchestration and model deployment automation,” Salem explained. “Astronomer delivers on this today, and as the orchestrator, is the one system that sees everything happening across the stack — when data moves, when transformations run, when models are trained.”\\nOver 85% of Airflow users surveyed expect an increase in external-facing or revenue-generating solutions built on Airflow in the next year, highlighting how data orchestration is increasingly powering customer-facing applications rather than just internal analytics.\\nThis trend is evident across industries, from automotive to legal technology companies that are building specialized AI models to automate professional workflows. These organizations are turning to Astronomer to handle the complex orchestration challenges that arise when scaling AI systems from prototypes to production environments serving thousands of users.\\nStrategic technology expansion: Airflow 3.0 and cloud partnerships position Astronomer for market leadership\\nThe company recently announced the general availability of Airflow 3.0, which it describes as “the most significant release in Airflow’s history.” The update introduces several transformative capabilities designed specifically for AI workloads, including the ability to run tasks “anywhere, any time, in any language.”\\n“Airflow 3.0 lays the foundation for executing tasks on any machine, on-prem or in the cloud, triggered by events across the data ecosystem,” Byron explained. “It also introduces a proof of concept for defining tasks in languages beyond Python, greatly improving data team agility and facilitating migration from legacy systems to Airflow.”\\nAstronomer has also expanded its industry partnerships, recently achieving the Google Cloud Ready – BigQuery Designation, making its platform available for purchase directly from the Google Cloud Marketplace. This allows existing Google Cloud customers to expedite their purchase of Astro and use their existing Google Cloud commit credits.\\n“We’ve just signed an awesome partnership with IBM,” Byron told VentureBeat. “They’re putting us into their broader data portfolio of products. And we think there’s an awesome opportunity for us, not only in North America, but internationally, to get a lot of momentum with IBM as well.”\\nUnified DataOps: The next evolution in enterprise data management\\nSalem believes Astronomer is positioned to redefine enterprise data operations, moving beyond orchestration to what the company calls “unified DataOps” — a comprehensive approach integrating observability, quality management, and governance into a single platform.\\n“We invested in Astronomer in 2019 with a simple bet: Airflow would become the standard for data orchestration,” Salem said. “Today, it runs at over 80,000 companies and drives 30 million downloads a month. We backed Astronomer because they’re not only riding that wave; they’re building the enterprise control plane on top of it.”\\nFor enterprises struggling to realize value from their AI investments, Astronomer’s growth signals a crucial shift in how data infrastructure is built and managed — one where orchestration serves as the foundation for the entire data stack.\\n“As AI raises the stakes for reliable, scalable data infrastructure, we’re doubling down on our investment,” Salem concluded. “Orchestration is just the start. The team at Astronomer are poised to unify the entire DataOps stack.”'}\n",

Even the most rigorous, experienced security professionals can overlook a step among the error-prone, manual processes that security protocols entail. And that risk is very much compounded by the amount of pressure IT professionals are under, including the extreme time crunches necessary to resolve issues quickly with the least damage as possible, mounting organizational pressures and increasingly sophisticated threats.\\nUnfortunately, the human error challenge is no surprise, says Mike Nichols, VP of product for security at Elastic.\\n“IT professionals have always been forced to do a great deal of complex switching between tasks and tools, they’re inundated with a massive number of alerts across systems, they’re chasing down data and putting out fires,” Nichols says. “On top of that, IT leaders are finding themselves in the trenches, triaging the effects of cybersecurity breaches, rather than hunting down and stopping these issues at the source. We’re hiring and paying for detectives, and they end up as beat cops instead.”\\nThe solution, Nichols says, is putting automation and AI into the hands of IT leaders and teams. By doing so, they can elevate and accelerate their performance — giving analysts immediate access to the information they need, helping them spot potential challenges early and automating parts of the data-sifting and discovery process. But while AI supports this work, it doesn’t replace the critical thinking and expertise analysts apply when making business and mission-driven decisions.\\nHow AI boosts human security expertise\\nPrescriptive AI made a dramatic difference when it first emerged on the security front, with machine learning algorithms able to identify suspicious patterns and send out alerts. But adversaries can wiggle around signature-based rules, and false positives became the bane of many an IT team’s life. Generative AI and today’s security solutions have even greater potential — as long as it’s deployed strategically, and not just as a shiny new toy. It also works best directly embedded into workflows, to mitigate the context-switching problem that is the source of much human error. When choosing a solution, the critical questions are whether it will accelerate the user’s processes, does the AI show its work and can its output be trusted and is it positioned to improve an analyst’s understanding of security issues in the enterprise.\\n“Where we’ve seen implementation work well is as an expert on an IT user’s shoulder, so they have the ability to ask questions quickly, get information and data on the fly,” Nichols says. “It’s also critical for prioritization and discovery, solving the problem of alert overwhelm, because it’s able to sort tickets, filter false positives or smaller problems and bring the biggest issues to the forefront.”\\nIt’s a setup that helps establish the OODA approach to decision-making: Observe, Orient, Decide and Act. In this looped approach, available information is filtered, then put into context so the decision-maker can make an informed choice at that moment, while staying agile and ready to pivot as more data becomes available.\\nOnce an expert analyst discovers a problem and then writes it up or fixes it, AI automation can put that learning back into the overall security operation, making it easily available to other analysts so that problems are solved more easily and work isn’t replicated over and over. With retrieval augmented generation, private context can be added to a well-trained public model, so that it returns bespoke answers to any analyst queries. This is especially true if organizational data is not typically operationalized, such as ticketing information from an ITSM solution, or configuration data from systems like firewalls or change logs.\\nThat also creates a natural learning environment. When a tier-1 analyst joins the team, they can use an AI assistant as a coach to ask questions, in natural language, in order to learn on the job. It’s a far more natural, easy-to-use way to take in and actually absorb critical information. This kind of conversational-learning environment helps employees feel engaged, especially in remote work environments, and offers new employees a way to grow as they learn from tier-2 and tier-3 experiences.\\nMaking security an enterprise-wide endeavor\\n“The fact that security ended up in IT is limiting, because there are so many amazing analytical thinkers in other places,” Nichols says. “Across your organization you’ll find people who have great analytical minds that can really see and understand patterns in data and can pick apart logistical dilemmas. They might not know a thing about logs, ports or servers, but they shouldn’t need to.”\\nIn fact, AI does make security a business or a mission problem, taking the pressure off overwhelmed security teams. Organizations can bring in a larger circle of people who understand the business context of security dilemmas, how they impact the wider organizational strategy as well as the daily workflows of employees — and generative AI tools give them the real-time insight they need into the systems they’re analyzing.\\n“When you bring in outside influences that aren’t in the typical IT or security suite you’ll find some amazing lessons learned and ways to improve your own processes,” he adds. “AI is just one way to help accelerate that, by expanding your horizon around what you think a security analyst actually has to be. Not the check-box certifications, but someone who understands what the underlying systems mean to a business, and can make business critical business calls when developing security strategy, implementing processes and mitigating risk.”\\nWhy AI adoption remains a struggle\\nAI has proven benefits at this point, but organizations are still lagging in adoption rates. The contributing factor mostly boils down to hesitation to perceived risks, and the cost and complexity of migrating from legacy security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to an AI-driven security analytics platform.\\nThe first phase of a migration plan requires collecting and normalizing data, starting with prebuilt data integrations. Technologies that require custom connectors typically come next, but the manual nature of building each such integration can significantly slow the adoption of the new SIEM.\\n“The cost to switch is always a big challenge,” Nichols says. “It’s not the product cost. The product cost is almost negligible in this. The cost of the switch is all of your TTPs, all of your rules, all of your queries, they all need to move to this other system, and we don’t have a magic universal language that we all use to make things simple.”\\nElastic developed a way to accelerate the process by automating SIEM data onboarding. Automatic Import automates the development of custom data integrations with generative AI, cutting the effort needed to create and validate custom integrations from several days to less than 10 minutes, and significantly lowering the learning curve for onboarding data.\\nThe feature is powered by the Elastic Search AI Platform, which provides model-agnostic access to harness the knowledge from LLMs and the ability to ground answers in proprietary data using RAG. The whole operation is completely transparent, from start to finish, with visual reports that highlight each successful one to one transfer, potential areas of conflict, and areas that require reconfiguration for the new security solution paradigm.\\n“It’s about trust in real time,” Nichols says. “Instead of a contractor presenting you with a PDF that claims there are green lights across the board, you have an in-depth view into what exactly happened over the course of the migration, so when you do flip the switch, you know you have coverage exactly where you need it.”\\nSponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Learn More\\nWhenever a patient gets a CT scan at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), the resulting images are automatically sent off to the cardiology department, analyzed by AI and assigned a cardiac risk score.\\nIn just a few months, thanks to a simple algorithm, AI has flagged several patients at high cardiovascular risk. The CT scan doesn’t have to be related to the heart; the patient doesn’t have to have heart problems. Every scan automatically triggers an evaluation.\\nIt is straightforward preventative care enabled by AI, allowing the medical facility to finally start utilizing their vast amounts of data.\\n“The data is just sitting out there,” Peter McCaffrey, UTMB’s chief AI officer, told VentureBeat. “What I love about this is that AI doesn’t have to do anything superhuman. It’s performing a low intellect task, but at very high volume, and that still provides a lot of value, because we’re constantly finding things that we miss.”\\nHe acknowledged, “We know we miss stuff. Before, we just didn’t have the tools to go back and find it.”\\nHow AI helps UTMB determine cardiovascular risk\\nLike many healthcare facilities, UTMB is applying AI across a number of areas. One of its first use cases is cardiac risk screening. Models have been trained to scan for incidental coronary artery calcification (iCAC), a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk. The goal is to identify patients susceptible to heart disease who may have otherwise been overlooked because they exhibit no obvious symptoms, McCaffrey explained.\\nThrough the screening program, every CT scan completed at the facility is automatically analyzed using AI to detect coronary calcification. The scan doesn’t have to have anything to do with cardiology; it could be ordered due to a spinal fracture or an abnormal lung nodule.\\nThe scans are fed into an image-based convolutional neural network (CNN) that calculates an Agatston score, which represents the accumulation of plaque in the patient’s arteries. Typically, this would be calculated by a human radiologist, McCaffrey explained.\\nFrom there, the AI allocates patients with an iCAC score at or above 100 into three ‘risk tiers’ based on additional information (such as whether they are on a statin or have ever had a visit with a cardiologist). McCaffrey explained that this assignment is rules-based and can draw from discrete values within the electronic health record (EHR), or the AI can determine values by processing free text such as clinical visit notes using GPT-4o.\\nPatients flagged with a score of 100 or more, with no known history of cardiology visitation or therapy, are automatically sent digital messages. The system also sends a note to their primary physician. Patients identified as having more severe iCAC scores of 300 or higher also receive a phone call.\\nMcCaffrey explained that almost everything is automated, except for the phone call; however, the facility is actively piloting tools in the hopes of also automating voice calls. The only area where humans are in the loop is in confirming the AI-derived calcium score and the risk tier before proceeding with automated notification.\\nSince launching the program in late 2024, the medical facility has evaluated approximately 450 scans per month, with five to ten of these cases being identified as high-risk each month, requiring intervention, McCaffrey reported.\\n“The gist here is no one has to suspect you have this disease, no one has to order the study for this disease,” he noted.\\nGiving physicians the few extra minutes that matter\\nAnother critical use case for AI is in the detection of stroke and pulmonary embolism. UTMB uses specialized algorithms that have been trained to spot specific symptoms and flag care teams within seconds of imaging to accelerate treatment.\\nLike with the iCAC scoring tool, CNNs, respectively trained for stroke and pulmonary embolisms, automatically receive CT scans and look for indicators such as obstructed blood flows or abrupt blood vessel cutoff.\\n“Human radiologists can detect these visual characteristics, but here the detection is automated and happens in mere seconds,” said McCaffrey.\\nAny CT ordered “under suspicion” of stroke or pulmonary embolism is automatically sent to the AI — for instance, a clinician in the ER may identify facial droop or slurring and issue a “CT stroke” order, triggering the algorithm.\\nBoth algorithms include a messaging application that notifies the entire care team as soon as a finding is made. This will include a screenshot of the image with a crosshair over the location of the lesion.\\n“These are particular emergency use cases where how quickly you initiate treatment matters,” said McCaffrey. “We’ve seen cases where we’re able to gain several minutes of intervention because we had a quicker heads up from AI.”\\nReducing hallucinations, anchoring bias\\nTo ensure models perform as optimally as possible, UTMB profiles them for sensitivity, specificity, F-1 score, bias and other factors both pre-deployment and recurrently post-deployment.\\nSo, for example, the iCAC algorithm is validated pre-deployment by running the model on a balanced set of CT scans while radiologists manually score — then the two are compared. In post-deployment review, meanwhile, radiologists are given a random subset of AI-scored CT scans and perform a full iCAC measurement that is blinded to the AI score. McCaffrey explained that this allows his team to calculate model error recurrently and also detect potential bias (which would be seen as a shift in the magnitude and/or directionality of error).\\nTo help prevent anchoring bias — where AI and humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter, thereby missing important details when making a decision — UTMB employs a “peer learning” technique. A random subset of radiology exams are chosen, shuffled, anonymized and distributed to different radiologists, and their answers are compared.\\nThis not only helps to rate individual radiologist performance, but also detects whether the rate of missed findings was higher in studies in which AI was used to specifically highlight particular anomalies (thus leading to anchoring bias).\\nFor instance, if AI were used to identify and flag bone fractures on an X-Ray, the team would look at whether studies with flags for bone fractures also had increased miss rates for other factors such as joint space narrowing (common in arthritis).\\nMcCaffrey and his team have found that successive model versions both within classes (various versions of GPT-4o) and across classes (GPT-4.5 vs 3.5) tend to have lower hallucination rate. “But this is non-zero and non-deterministic so — while nice — we can’t just ignore the possibility and ramifications of hallucination,” he said.\\nTherefore, they typically gravitate to generative AI tools that do a good job of citing their sources. For instance, a model that summarizes a patient’s medical course while also surfacing the clinical notes that served as the basis for its output.\\n“This allows the provider to efficiently serve as a safeguard against hallucination,” said McCaffrey.\\nFlagging ‘basic stuff’ to enhance healthcare\\nUTMB is also utilizing AI in several other areas, including an automated system that assists medical staff in determining whether inpatient admissions are justified. The system works as a co-pilot, automatically extracting all patient notes from the EHR and using Claude, GPT and Gemini to summarize and examine them before presenting assessments to staff.\\n“This lets our personnel look across the entire patient population and filter/triage patients,” McCaffrey explained. The tool also assists personnel in drafting documentation to support admission or observation.\\nIn other areas, AI is used to re-examine reports like echocardiology interpretations or clinical notes and identify gaps in care. In many cases, “it’s simply flagging basic stuff,” said McCaffrey.\\nHealthcare is complex, with data feeds coming in from everywhere, he noted — images, physician notes, lab results — but very little of that data has been computed because there simply hasn’t been enough human manpower.\\nThis has led to what he described as a “massive, massive intellectual bottleneck.” A lot of data simply isn’t being computed, even though there is great potential be proactive and find things earlier.\\n“It’s not an indictment of any particular place,” McCaffrey emphasized. “It’s just generally the state of healthcare.” Absent AI, “you can’t deploy the intelligence, the scrutiny, the thought work at the scale required to catch everything.”\"}\n",

Today, James leads the AI systems and training team in Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI). It’s an extremely fast-paced field where the speed of technological progress requires a lot of continuous learning—but according to James, that’s what makes working in the field so dynamic and exciting. We chatted with James to learn more about his career journey so far and get the inside scoop on working as a machine learning (ML) engineer.\\nJames’s interest in computers began at a relatively young age. “When I was around 14, I convinced my parents to get me a powerful computer for a CAD course at school. Technically, I didn’t have to have one, but I really wanted one because I was super into the custom PC thing, and all my friends were too. I picked out all the parts, watched guides, built it myself and had a lot of fun playing games on it.”\\n“But the unexpected hobby that came from it was getting really into benchmarking and overclocking the PC to see what kind of performance numbers I could get. At the time, it was all utilities—I had no idea how to actually program and wouldn’t learn until six years later,” says James.\\nA college class taught by a Red Hatter\\nJames’s first real introduction to ML came through an undergraduate data science class at Boston University taught by a fellow Red Hatter, Lance Galleti. Through the Red Hat Collaboratory At Boston University, James began working with Lance as a research assistant during his undergraduate studies, exploring how to use adversarial ML to make models intentionally misclassify image data and, in turn, understand and omit the vulnerabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This was James’ first foray into the ML space, but he wouldn’t start working in the field full-time until a few years later.\\nAs James progressed through his Master in Computer Science coursework, focused on computer systems and AI, he joined Red Hat as an intern, working on packaging utilities for Fedora CentOS. This was followed by two years as a software engineer in the Open Source Program Office (OSPO), where he worked with his colleague, Cali, to build Project Aspen—a community metric visualization project with the aim of better understanding how open source communities grow and interact. These projects helped James develop a solid foundation in data science and engineering, and he learned a lot, and fast, from his engineering leads along the way.\\nA chance encounter in the Boston cafeteria\\nJames’s transition into the ML engineer role began with a chance encounter in the office cafeteria. “I was in the Boston office one day when two engineering leaders casually mentioned a project happening downstairs that needed extra hands,” says James, reminiscing about the early days of InstructLab. This chance encounter led James to InstructLab, where he worked on expanding its knowledge taxonomy.\\nThat quickly evolved into a deeper technical role. “I was totally in the weeds for weeks. I was on a little three-person team that got InstructLab working on a MacBook for the first time, which was really cool. I even got a nice note from Matt Hicks at the end. I had no idea what I was doing at the time because I was so out of practice and hadn’t done that kind of work in a year. But we made it work, and from there, I kind of got swept up in the current—we were more or less informally asked to keep working on the project.”\\nBefore James knew it, he was fully immersed in InstructLab and ended up at a career-defining crossroads where he had to decide between continuing his work in the OSPO or diving deeper into AI.\\nUltimately, the opportunity to work on the leading edge of ML won out. “I was really wrenched in both directions because I cared so much about what I was working on in OSPO. It came down to the size of the opportunity. I really wanted to flex different muscles in my head and do things that were kind of my dream as an undergrad and a graduate student.”\\nGoing all-in on machine learning\\nJames’ current team focuses on model post-training, including supervised fine-tuning and hardware-influenced optimization. The MLengineer role itself is still relatively new, but James shared with us what the day-to-day of the role actually entails.\\nFirstly, according to James, a portion of their time is spent in meetings coordinating across teams. The model production, synthetic data generation (SDG) and core InstructLab teams are all tightly interwoven, so collaboration is key.\\nAs James’s speciality is more focused on AI computing, he spends a lot of his time on new applications and developments within his particular niche. “It\\'s a lot of working in the upstream, reading code, learning how things are actually working under the hood and some of these more unorthodox implementations and optimizations to make things faster—reading the loss curve of the model as it trains, making sure that it is correct and it\\'s not going to break everything. A lot of debugging goes into that too.” The team also collaborates closely with their colleagues in the AI innovation team on the best ways to approach problems.\\nWhen asked about the ups and downs of the role, James mentions that there have been more highlights than challenges so far.\\n“One of the big moments was open sourcing InstructLab—we all got together in a conference room, and I bought champagne for everybody. As the corks popped, one of the engineers hit a giant foam button that open sourced the repo. Watching people start to trickle in was a huge moment.”\\nThe team dynamic has also been a highlight. “I\\'ve had really great leadership along the way who have given me, and other engineers, the space to learn what we need to. There was a period of time where I was working a ton because I was so hungry for knowledge—moving to InstructLab felt like a once-in-a-career pivot, and you don\\'t usually get these opportunities to join right at the beginning of a project.”\\nOne of the biggest challenges in the field, however, is simply keeping up. As AI continues to evolve faster than a person can absorb, continuous learning is key.\\n“I can learn something in a lot of depth and when I revisit that a couple months later, I’m way out of date. It\\'s a massive continuous learning undertaking. I think I\\'ve read more in the last year than I did during my entire undergraduate degree. The only tractable solution for handling that information fire hose is to specialize in something that your brain naturally likes.”\\nSolving tough problems—in the open\\nSo what are those areas of specialization that keep James motivated to keep learning? James says that he’s primarily interested in compute—how to achieve faster inference and training, how to scale systems effectively and how hardware choices influence design decisions. “Really, I\\'m a technologist who loves using new open source tools to do things faster. Compute-heavy machine learning projects are fragile, layered and complex.”\\nFor James, these are the most rewarding problems: experimental, difficult to fully grasp and often lacking clear documentation or established solutions. They require a willingness to navigate ambiguity, troubleshoot issues without obvious causes and learn continuously in a rapidly evolving field.\\nUltimately, working in an industry in flux is also what James feels makes his role unique. “To not know where your field will be in two or three months is a pretty unique experience for an engineer,” says James. And working in the open source AI space at Red Hat allows him to be on the leading edge of these technologies.\\n“The most interesting projects out there are open source, and because I’m a Red Hatter, I’m immediately a peer in those communities. The default at Red Hat when there\\'s something interesting upstream is to start throwing our engineering weight behind it—making contributions, updating docs and looking at tests. There’s little resistance to trying new stuff and moving fast and getting involved. Red Hat has a unique position in the field and an upstream-first mentality.\"\\nLooking to the future—but enjoying the journey along the way\\nJames sees his career evolving in two phases. “Right now, I’m in the part where I have to get really strong technically. So I have a lot of fun as an engineer and especially as a machine learning engineer. I have a lot of great distinguished engineer mentors and people around who I learn from,” says James.\\n“Then, at some stage, I would love to focus more on strategic and technical leadership. I\\'ve had to work really hard to be good at engineering—my natural gifts are a lot more people-oriented and strategy-oriented, so I’d like to lean into that more.”\\nThe AI industry can be all-consuming, so James leans on a handful of hobbies to decompress. \"I love cycling. I also do a lot of urban hiking —I like to climb Capitol Hill and the neighbouring parks or Magnolia and Queen Ann where I like to walk around all the steep areas and hang out. I\\'m also a big baseball fan. I love the New York Mets.\"\\nAdvice for aspiring machine learning engineers\\nJames believes that the fundamental difference between a machine learning engineer and a software engineer role is slim, but ultimately comes down to the former having a strong mathematical background.\\n“A lot of the work in our team can be done by strong software engineers. The only gap is when you have to make a mathematically informed decision about a specific niche, and for that, it helps to have done the coursework and be comfortable reading research papers,” explains James. “Can you read something like the DeepSeek paper, which blew everyone away, and gut-check what the paper says? If a model is exhibiting weird behaviour, do you know how to figure out what the problem is?”\\nA lot of this is teachable though, says James, and there are many engineers across Red Hat that have moved laterally into the AI field. “There’s so much space for everybody. You don’t have to know how it all works off the bat to be involved.”\\nMore broadly, he believes that a knowledge of the AI space is essential for any engineer or technologist. “You can start by getting invested in any AI-focused community. Helping with tutorials and improving the docs is the easiest way to get involved—you just need to take the time to figure out how to do it and then make it easier for the next person.” (Like getting InstructLab to run on a MacBook perhaps?)\\nOur AI Engineering team is growing, and we’re looking for passionate technologists to join James in making AI technology available and accessible to all.

We're also expanding Claude's Research capabilities with an advanced mode that searches the web, your Google Workspace, and now your Integrations too. Claude can research for up to 45 minutes before delivering a comprehensive report, complete with citations. In addition to these updates, we're making web search available globally for all Claude users on paid plans.\\nIntegrations\\nLast November, we launched the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open standard connecting AI apps to tools and data. Until now, support for MCP was limited to Claude Desktop through local servers. Today, we're introducing Integrations, allowing Claude to work seamlessly with remote MCP servers across the web and desktop apps. Developers can build and host servers that enhance Claude’s capabilities, while users can discover and connect any number of these to Claude.\\nWhen you connect your tools to Claude, it gains deep context about your work—understanding project histories, task statuses, and organizational knowledge—and can take actions across every surface. Claude becomes a more informed collaborator, helping you execute complex projects in one place with expert assistance at every step.\\nTo start, you can choose from Integrations for 10 popular services, including Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Zapier, Cloudflare, Intercom, Asana, Square, Sentry, PayPal, Linear, and Plaid—with more to follow from companies like Stripe and GitLab. Developers can also create their own Integrations in as little as 30 minutes using our documentation or solutions like Cloudflare that provide built-in OAuth authentication, transport handling, and integrated deployment.\\nEach integration drastically expands what Claude can do. Zapier, for example, connects thousands of apps through pre-built workflows, automating processes across your software stack. With the Zapier Integration, Claude can access these apps and your custom workflows through conversation—even automatically pulling sales data from HubSpot and preparing meeting briefs based on your calendar.\\nWith access to Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence, Claude can collaborate with you on building new products, managing tasks more effectively, and scaling your work by summarizing and creating multiple Confluence pages and Jira work items at once.\\nConnect Intercom to respond faster to user feedback. Intercom's AI agent Fin, now an MCP client, can take actions like filing bugs in Linear when users report issues. Chat with Claude to identify patterns and debug using Intercom's conversation history and user attributes—managing the entire workflow from user feedback to bug resolution in one conversation.\\nAdvanced Research\\nWe're introducing several new updates to build on our recently-released Research capability. Claude can now conduct deeper investigations across hundreds of internal and external sources, delivering more comprehensive reports in anywhere from five to 45 minutes.\\nWith its new ability to do more complex research, available when you toggle on the Research button, Claude breaks down your request into smaller parts, investigating each deeply before compiling a comprehensive report. While most reports complete in five to 15 minutes, Claude may take up to 45 minutes for more complex investigations—work that would typically take hours of manual research.\\nWe've also expanded Claude's data access. We launched Research with support for web search and Google Workspace, but now with Integrations, Claude can also search any application you connect.\\nWhen Claude incorporates information from sources, it provides clear citations that link directly to the original material. This transparency ensures you can confidently use Claude's research findings, knowing exactly where each insight originated.\\nGetting started\\nIntegrations and advanced Research are now available in beta on the Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, and will soon be available on Pro. Web search is now globally available to all Claude.ai paid plans. For more information on getting started with Integrations, MCP servers, and security and privacy practices when connecting data sources to Claude, visit our Help Center.\"}\n",

Venture firm Accel led the round, with participation from Meritech Capital and several existing backers including Eclipse, Riot Ventures, Menlo Ventures, and Narya. Stifel Bank is providing the debt portion of the raise.\\nFounded in 2022, True Anomaly has positioned itself as an emerging player in the military space market. The company designs spacecraft that can maneuver near other satellites in orbit — technology that aligns with U.S. efforts to bolster space domain awareness and respond to potential threats in orbit. Space domain awareness is the ability to detect, track and understand objects and activities in space.\\nThe company’s flagship vehicle, called the Jackal, is designed for close-proximity operations, using optical and radar sensors to gather high-resolution imagery and conduct reconnaissance. The company also builds software platforms for training and simulations aimed at preparing military personnel for space conflict scenarios.\\nWith the new funds, True Anomaly plans to support four space missions over the next 18 months, introduce new products and grow its workforce from 170 to more than 250 employees by the end of this year.\\nThe company’s upcoming missions include its third test flight of the Jackal to low Earth orbit to continue validating spacecraft performance and production techniques. It also plans to launch its first Jackal missions to geostationary orbit—a region 22,000 miles above the Earth used by many military satellites—and to cislunar space, the area between Earth and the Moon that has emerged as a new domain of strategic interest.\\nAnother major upcoming mission is Victus Haze, a $30 million contract awarded by the U.S. Space Force as part of its Tactically Responsive Space initiative. True Anomaly has partnered with Firefly Aerospace to deliver the mission, which aims to demonstrate how quickly the U.S. can launch and operate satellites in response to dynamic threats in orbit.\\nIn February, True Anomaly announced it is opening a new 90,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach, California, placing it closer to Space Systems Command in Los Angeles, which oversees billions in Space Force procurement.

I couldn’t believe it was real so I checked myself. It was even worse when I checked.”\\nSince then, he said he has “faced a steady stream of false accusations that are deeply damaging to my character and the safety of my family.”\\nThe political commentator said he was in Tennessee during the Jan. 6 riot. The suit, filed in Delaware Superior Court on Tuesday, seeks more than $5 million in damages.\\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Meta said that “as part of our continuous effort to improve our models, we have already released updates and will continue to do so.”\\nStarbuck’s lawsuit joins the ranks of similar cases in which people have sued AI platforms over information provided by chatbots. In 2023, a conservative radio host in Georgia filed a defamation suit against OpenAI alleging ChatGPT provided false information by saying he defrauded and embezzled funds from the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun-rights group.\\nJames Grimmelmann, professor of digital and information law at Cornell Tech and Cornell Law School, said there is “no fundamental reason why” AI companies couldn’t be held liable in such cases. Tech companies, he said, can’t get around defamation “just by slapping a disclaimer on.”\\n“You can’t say, ‘Everything I say might be unreliable, so you shouldn’t believe it. And by the way, this guy’s a murderer.’ It can help reduce the degree to which you’re perceived as making an assertion, but a blanket disclaimer doesn’t fix everything,” he said. “There’s nothing that would hold the outputs of an AI system like this categorically off limits.”\\nGrimmelmann said there are some similarities between the arguments tech companies make in AI-related defamation and copyright infringement cases, like those brought forward by newspapers, authors and artists. The companies often say that they are not in a position to supervise everything an AI does, he said, and they claim they would have to compromise the tech’s usefulness or shut it down entirely “if you held us liable for every harmful, infringing output, it’s produced.”\\n“I think it is an honestly difficult problem, how to prevent AI from hallucinating in the ways that produce unhelpful information, including false statements,” Grimmelmann said. “Meta is confronting that in this case. They attempted to make some fixes to their models of the system, and Starbuck complained that the fixes didn’t work.”\\nWhen Starbuck discovered the claims made by Meta’s AI, he tried to alert the company about the error and enlist its help to address the problem. The complaint said Starbuck contacted Meta’s managing executives and legal counsel, and even asked its AI about what should be done to address the allegedly false outputs.\\nAccording to the lawsuit, he then asked Meta to “retract the false information, investigate the cause of the error, implement safeguards and quality control processes to prevent similar harm in the future, and communicate transparently with all Meta AI users about what would be done.”\\nThe filing alleges that Meta was unwilling to make those changes or “take meaningful responsibility for its conduct.”\\n“Instead, it allowed its AI to spread false information about Mr. Starbuck for months after being put on notice of the falsity, at which time it ‘fixed’ the problem by wiping Mr. Starbuck’s name from its written responses altogether,” the suit said.\\nJoel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, responded to a video Starbuck posted to X outlining the lawsuit and called the situation “unacceptable.”\\n“This is clearly not how our AI should operate,” Kaplan said on X. “We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem.”\\nKaplan said he is working with Meta’s product team to “understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.”\\nStarbuck said that in addition to falsely saying he participated in the the riot at the U.S. Capitol, Meta AI also falsely claimed he engaged in Holocaust denial, and said he pleaded guilty to a crime despite never having been “arrested or charged with a single crime in his life.”\\nMeta later “blacklisted” Starbuck’s name, he said, adding that the move did not solve the problem because Meta includes his name in news stories, which allows users to then ask for more information about him.\\n“While I’m the target today, a candidate you like could be the next target, and lies from Meta’s AI could flip votes that decide the election,” Starbuck said on X. “You could be the next target too.”\\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

However, recent events prove one thing: The stakes — and the data — have never been higher. In response, Cribl Inc. has partnered with Palo Alto Networks Inc. to provide robust extended security intelligence and automation management while streamlining the implementation of new technologies such as agentic AI, according to Myke Lyons (pictured), chief information security officer of Cribl.\\n“There are so many of our customers in that space, and it’s really along the theme of still being able to own and have your agency around where that data goes,” he said. “And in this case, going to Palo Alto made perfect sense because there are so many customers of ours that are wanting and adopting those technologies like [Cortex] XSIAM, [which is] very much in line with where we’re going.”\\nLyons spoke with theCUBE’s Dave Vellante and John Furrier at the RSAC 2025 Conference, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They explored a candid, in-the-trenches view of modern cybersecurity challenges, emerging artificial intelligence applications and the shifting landscape of data operations. (* Disclosure below.)\\nXSIAM’s return and the continued rise of agentic AI\\nOnce a hot topic that cooled over time, XSIAM is now returning to relevance, thanks to real-world applications and an expanding AI ecosystem. Driven by market demand, Cribl has similarly abandoned its previously integration-agnostic approach. Many Cribl customers are already entrenched in the Palo Alto ecosystem, and the need to manage data ownership while maintaining flexibility in security infrastructure made the partnership a natural fit, according to Lyons.\\n“Cleaning the data in many ways is important,” he said. “Logs are written by developers who have very different points of view as they write these logs or build these logs within their applications. Most developers want verbosity; they want debug level. Security people don’t want that stuff. We want to be able to turn it on if we really have to, but generally, we don’t want it.”\\nAs security data soars at a 28% compound annual growth rate, according to Lyons, organizations are being forced to confront a new reality: Faster, smarter and more scalable pipelines are no longer optional. Modern security operations rely heavily on multi-destination pipelines. As such, the ability to filter, route and manage data efficiently — without overloading platforms or burning budgets — is now foundational.\\n“The challenge is we have to get into use cases and how we’re going to leverage these things,” he said. “And every non-tech person who’s an investor or a finance person or [chief financial officer] is asking you to adopt more AI. Well, you can’t just adopt more AI — that doesn’t mean anything. I could have the Perplexity app on my phone, but it doesn’t mean I’m adopting it. I must be able to understand what I have.”\\nBeyond infrastructure, AI is transforming the workforce itself. The modern chief information security officer juggles multiple roles — sometimes three or four at once. Agentic AI, when thoughtfully deployed, becomes a tool for defense, executive function and communication, according to Lyons. Rather than replacing jobs, AI is augmenting them — a trend that’s especially meaningful for tier-1 analysts, who may find traditional responsibilities increasingly automated.\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the RSAC 2025 Conference event:\\n(* Disclosure: Cribl Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

Case in point: Wired now reports that the initiative has hired a “young man with no government experience” to help revise federal regulations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That man, Christopher Sweet, hasn’t even completed his undergraduate degree yet, the outlet claims.\\nWired cites internal emails to reveal Sweet’s onboarding at the agency: “I’d like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” an email sent by DOGE staffer Scott Lanmack reads. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”\\nSweet’s role with the government will apparently involve an effort to use software to revise and downsize government regulations at the housing agency. The outlet writes:\\nSweet’s primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD’s regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD’s data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)\\nSweet’s recruitment is very much in line with DOGE’s overall modus operandi, which seems to be this: hire young, expendable tech nerds who don’t know what they’re doing, hurl them into legally sketchy activities that involve complex government processes, watch them flail and tell the public what a great job they’re doing. Indeed, DOGE’s army of pimply-faced government deconstructionists often seems so out of their depth that it’s a wonder that Washington D.C. isn’t literally on fire right now.\\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Elon Musk admitted the initiative has fallen far short of his promise to cut $2 trillion in spending and had made many mistakes. “I think we’re probably getting things right 70-80% of the time,” he said. That’s not a great hit rate when millions of people’s lives depend on government programs.\\nAll of it seems to support the working theory that DOGE isn’t really interested in making the government more efficient, but is actually trying to destroy a large number of agencies. Such a mandate would better align it with the policy blueprint laid out during Trump’s campaign: the right-wing libertarian Project 2025, which has sought to cut all but bare necessities of government.\\nFurther supporting this theory is the fact that, despite DOGE’s apparent mission to cut government spending, the U.S. spent $220 billion more during Trump’s first 100 days compared to the spending rates during the same period in 2024.'}\n",

The e-commerce giant said, citing benchmarks, that its newest model outperformed DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI’s o1 reasoning models.\\nProver-V2 is an update to its predecessor, Prover-V1.5, which debuted in August – four months before DeepSeek stunned the world with its V3 model. The company said that V3 was developed at a fraction of the cost and energy used by Western peers in training advanced AI models.\\nIn a technical report for Prover-V1.5, DeepSeek said its work on pre-training the specialist model had advanced its base model’s capabilities in formal theorem proving and mathematical reasoning.\\nWhile DeepSeek has not openly shared its timeline or progress for new models, the company has regularly published its latest research results, including updates to the Prover model.\\nLast month, DeepSeek also launched an update to its V3 foundational model, which features enhanced reasoning, optimised coding and upgraded Chinese writing capabilities, according to a notice on the company’s website.'}\n",

Unlike informal problem solving, which allows for intuition and loosely defined heuristics, formal theorem proving relies on every step being fully described, precise, and verifiable by computational systems. Proof assistants, such as Lean, Coq, and Isabelle, serve as the structural frameworks within which these formal proofs are constructed. Their operation demands logical soundness with no space for omissions, approximations, or unstated assumptions. This makes the challenge particularly demanding for AI systems, especially large language models, which excel in producing coherent natural language responses but typically lack the rigor to produce verifiable formal proofs. However, the desire to blend these strengths, AI’s fluency in informal reasoning and the structure of formal verification, has led to new innovations at the interface of language modeling and formal logic automation.\\nA major issue arises from the inability of current language models to bridge the conceptual divide between informal and formal reasoning. Language models typically excel at generating human-like explanations and solving math problems written in natural language. However, this reasoning is inherently informal and often lacks the structural precision required by formal logic systems. While humans can intuitively leap from one deductive step to another, proof assistants require a fully specified sequence of steps, free of ambiguity. Thus, the challenge is to guide AI models to produce logically coherent formal outputs from their otherwise informal and intuitive internal reasoning processes. This problem becomes increasingly complex when handling advanced theorems from domains such as number theory or geometry, where precision is crucial.\\nRecent efforts have attempted to address this issue by guiding models first to generate natural language proof sketches, which are then manually or semi-automatically translated into formal proof steps. A known strategy includes decomposing a complex theorem into smaller subgoals. Each subgoal represents a lemma that can be tackled independently and later combined to form a complete proof. Frameworks like “Draft, Sketch, and Prove” have applied this idea, using language models to generate proof outlines that are then translated into formal language. Another method employs hierarchical reinforcement learning, breaking down complex mathematical problems into simpler layers. However, these models often struggle to produce fully verifiable outputs in Lean or Coq environments. Moreover, the training data for these models is usually limited, and proof attempts frequently fail to yield successful outcomes that provide useful learning signals.\\nA team of researchers from DeepSeek-AI has introduced a new model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2, designed to generate formal mathematical proofs by leveraging subgoal decomposition and reinforcement learning. The core of their approach utilizes DeepSeek-V3 to break down a complex theorem into manageable subgoals, each of which is translated into a “have” statement in Lean 4 with a placeholder indicating that the proof is incomplete. These subgoals are then passed to a 7B-sized prover model that completes each proof step. Once all steps are resolved, they are synthesized into a complete Lean proof and paired with the original natural language reasoning generated by DeepSeek-V3. This forms a rich cold-start dataset for reinforcement learning. Importantly, the model’s training is entirely bootstrapped from synthetic data, with no human-annotated proof steps used.\\nThe cold-start pipeline begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to create proof sketches in natural language. These sketches are transformed into formal theorem statements with unresolved parts. A key innovation lies in recursively solving each subgoal using the 7B prover, reducing computation costs while maintaining formal rigor. Researchers constructed a curriculum learning framework that increased the complexity of training tasks over time. They also implemented two types of subgoal theorems, one incorporating preceding subgoals as premises, and one treating them independently. This dual structure was embedded into the model’s expert iteration stage to train it on progressively more challenging problem sets. The model’s capability was then reinforced through a consistency-based reward system during training, ensuring that all decomposed lemmas were correctly incorporated into the final formal proof.\\nOn the MiniF2F-test benchmark, the model achieved an 88.9% pass rate with high sampling (Pass@8192), compared to 82.0% by Kimina-Prover and 64.7% by Geodel-Prover. It also solved 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench, a platform featuring challenging mathematical tasks. On the newly introduced ProverBench dataset, comprising 325 formalized problems, the model addressed 6 out of 15 issues from the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) competitions for the years 2024 and 2025. These benchmarks highlight the model’s generalization ability across multiple formal reasoning tasks. Even when compared to DeepSeek-V3, which employs natural-language reasoning, the new model demonstrates competitive performance, solving a comparable number of AIME problems while ensuring formal verifiability.\\nSeveral Key Takeaways from the Research on DeepSeek-Prover-V2:\\n- DeepSeek-Prover-V2 achieved an 88.9% pass rate on the MiniF2F-test (Pass@8192), the highest reported among formal reasoning models so far.\\n- The model successfully solved 49 out of 658 problems from the PutnamBench dataset, which contains advanced mathematical challenges.\\n- It tackled 6 out of 15 problems from the recent AIME 2024–2025 competitions, showcasing real-world applicability.\\n- A new benchmark, ProverBench, comprising 325 formal problems, has been introduced for evaluating formal reasoning models.\\n- The pipeline unifies natural language proof sketching and formal proof construction by combining DeepSeek-V3 and a 7B prover model.\\n- Two types of subgoal decompositions—one with and one without dependent premises—were used to train the model in a structured, curriculum-guided manner.\\n- Reinforcement learning with a consistency-based reward significantly improved proof accuracy by enforcing structural alignment between sketch and solution.\\n- The entire training strategy relies on synthetic cold-start data, eliminating dependence on manually labeled proofs.\\nCheck out the model on Paper and GitHub Page.

We explored this algorithmic technique and how it can be used to jailbreak LLMs, which could be leveraged by threat actors to manipulate systems and steal sensitive data.\\nKey Takeaways\\n- We took a deep dive into the concept of Prompt Leakage (PLeak) by developing strings for jailbreaking system prompts, exploring its transferability, and evaluating it through a guardrail system. PLeak could allow attackers to exploit system weaknesses, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive data such as trade secrets.\\n- Organizations that are currently incorporating or are considering the use of large language models (LLMs) in their workflows must heighten their vigilance against prompt leaking attacks.\\n- Adversarial training and prompt classifier creation are some steps companies can take to proactively secure their systems. Companies can also consider taking advantage of solutions like Trend Vision One™ – Zero Trust Secure Access (ZTSA) to avoid potential sensitive data leakage or unsecure outputs in cloud services. The solution can also deal with GenAI system risks and attacks against AI models.\\nIn the second article of our series on attacking artificial intelligence (AI), let us explore an algorithmic technique designed to induce system prompt leakage in LLMs, which is called PLeak.\\nSystem Prompt Leakage pertains to the risk that preset system prompts or instructions meant to be followed by the model can reveal sensitive data when exposed.\\nFor organizations, this means that private information such as internal rules, functionalities, filtering criteria, permissions, and user roles can be leaked. This could give attackers opportunities to exploit system weaknesses, potentially leading to data breaches, disclosure of trade secrets, regulatory violations, and other unfavorable outcomes.\\nResearch and innovation related to LLMs surges day by day, with HuggingFace alone having close to 200k unique text generation models. With this boom in generative AI, it becomes crucial to understand and mitigate the security implications of these models.\\nLLMs rely on learnt probability distribution to give out a response in an auto-regressive manner, which opens different attack vectors for jailbreaking these models.\\nSimple techniques like DAN (Do Anything Now), ignore previous instructions, and others that we described in our previous blog, leverage simple prompt engineering to cleverly construct adversarial prompts which can be used to jailbreak LLM systems without necessarily requiring access to model weights.\\nAs LLMs improve against these known categories of prompt injections, research is shifting towards automating prompt attacks that use open-source LLMs to optimize prompts that can potentially be used to attack LLM systems based on these models. PLeak, GCG (Greedy Coordinate Gradient), and PiF (Perceived Flatten Importance) are some of the stronger attack methods that fall under this category.\\nFor this blog, we will be looking into PLeak, which was introduced in the research paper entitled PLeak: Prompt Leaking Attacks against Large Language Model Applications. The algorithmic method was designed for System Prompt Leakage, which ties directly to guidelines defined in OWASP’s 2025 Top 10 Risk & Mitigations for LLMs and Gen AI Apps and MITRE ATLAS.\\nWe seek to expand on the PLeak paper through the following:\\n- Develop comprehensive and effective strings for jailbreaking system prompts that follow the real-world distribution and have implications if successfully leaked.\\n- Showcase different mappings of System Prompt Leak Objective to MITRE and OWASP with examples to further showcase PLeak capabilities.\\n- Expand transferability capabilities presented in PLeak to other models by evaluating our version of PLeak attack strings on well-known LLMs.\\n- Lastly, evaluate PLeak with a production-level guardrail system to verify if the adversarial strings are recognized as jailbreak attempts.\\nPLeak workflow\\nPLeak follows a particular workflow which involves the following:\\n- Shadow and target model: The PLeak algorithm requires these two models for an effective attack. The shadow model pertains to any offline model whose weights can be accessed. It is responsible for running the algorithm and generating the adversarial strings, which are then sent to the target model to evaluate the attack success rate.\\n- Adversarial strings and optimization loop: The optimization algorithm attempts to maximize the probability of revealing the system prompt given the generated adversarial (user) prompt. A random string is initialized based on the chosen length. The algorithm iterates over this string and optimizes it by replacing one token per iteration until a better string cannot be achieved (i.e., loss values do not improve).\\nIn the example below, we carefully designed an ideal system prompt that follows standard security design principles as per MITRE and OWASP. When attacking Llama-3.1-8b-Instruct using one of the generated adversarial strings as a user prompt, for the model, it seems that the user is asking about the LLM system prompt or the last instruction seen by the LLM; the model simply reveals the entire system prompt in the assistant response.\\nJailbreaking Llama family of LLMs with PLeak\\nIn this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLeak against Llama 3 models for evaluating the following:\\n- MITRE ATLAS LLM - Meta Prompt Extraction\\n- MITRE ATLAS - Privilege Escalation\\n- MITRE-ATLAS - Credential Access\\n- OWASP LLM07 - System Prompt Leakage\\n- OWASP LLM06 - Excessive Agency\\n- Experimental setup\\nTo generate adversarial strings using PLeak, we followed the given guidelines, which we established during the research and experimentation phase:\\n- Shadow dataset - The PLeak algorithm requires this dataset, which can be used to build the adversarial string. The effectiveness of the generated strings depends on how diverse and generalized the system prompt is. We collected and generated around 6,000 system prompts to create a generalized shadow dataset.\\n- Adversarial string length - We tried adversarial strings of different lengths across various random seeds since PLeak’s optimization algorithm can get stuck in local optima. Using different seeds and lengths allows for an expanded search space, leading to better locally optimal solutions.\\n- Compute and batch size - PLeak is a compute-heavy algorithm that scales with the model size. For example, on an optimization batch size of 600 system prompts, Llama-3.2-3b can utilize close to 60 GB of GPU VRAM on a max sequence length of 200. We performed all the experiments on a single A100-80gb on a batch size ranging from 300-600 system prompts, depending on the model parameters.\\nNote: To have the maximum attack success rate, it is advised that both the shadow model and the target model are from the same model or model families.\\nAll the attacks presented in the next sections are based on different Llama models, giving a preview of how PLeak applies to different sizes of model parameters.\\n1. Exposing the ruleset through system prompt leakage\\nMITRE ATLAS: LLM Meta Prompt Extraction and OWASP-LLM07: System Prompt Leakage (Exposure of Internal Rules) define the risks of an attacker gaining access to the system/meta prompt of the LLM system.\\nThis could grant attackers access to the decision-making process of the system. The results of this can be used by attackers to exploit weaknesses or bypass the rules of the system.\\nExample:\\nA system prompt showcases a MortgageBOT with some rules that govern its decision-making process when interacting with a customer online. An attacker sends the adversarial prompt created using PLeak.\\nDespite the explicit instruction not to reveal the rules, the assistant blindly responds by revealing the exact system prompt. This could create numerous opportunities for exploitation, as such rules can be manipulated to allow an attacker to achieve their intended result, such as qualifying for unrealistically low mortgage limits.\\n2. Accessing/gaining root access through system prompt leakage\\nMITRE ATLAS: Privilege Escalation (Prompt Injection) and OWASP-LLM06: Excessive Agency (Excessive Permissions) define the risks of an attacker gaining root or file access that ideally is hidden from the end user.\\nThis could lead to an attack gaining access to sensitive/private information of another user on the network, or to other directory-based attacks that are detrimental to the LLM service providers.\\nExample:\\nThe system prompt shown in the example below is crafted while keeping OWASP and MITRE guidelines in mind. The prompt showcases an LLM with access to some tools. When the attacker passes the adversarial strings to the LLM, the LLM responds with the full system prompt revealed.\\nIn the leaked prompt, the attacker can observe that on invoking the save_as_memory function, the tool saves information to a user folder that is distinguished by ${user_name}_${session_id} identifier. The attacker can leverage this information and try to find different username and session_id pairs, which, if found, allow them to access the files and secrets of any user on the network.\\n3. Exposing sensitive information through system prompt leakage\\nMITRE ALTAS: Credential Excess and OWASP-LLM07: System Prompt Leakage (Exposure of Sensitive Functionality) define the risks of attackers gaining access to sensitive information such as software versions, database table names, or even access tokens.\\nThey could lead to attackers gaining unauthorized access to the system and can do all sorts of harmful attacks with this information.\\nExample:\\nIn the example, we crafted a system prompt that lists three different classifications of sensitive information and credentials of the system, i.e., the database version used → MySQL 8.0, table name → EMPLOYEE_CS_2021_4, and a token prefixed with ${user_id}. We tested one of our adversarial strings with this system prompt on the largest Llama model (Llama 3.1 405B). The model responded with an exact system prompt.\\nIf this occurs in a real-life scenario, the attacker now has access to all this information and can build targeted attacks that exploit these credentials and gain escalated access to the system.\\nPLeak against production guardrails\\nAfter demonstrating that PLeak is an effective method for revealing system prompts, the next logical step would be to see if these adversarial prompts are recognized as jailbreak attempts by one of the production-level LLM providers there.\\nTo achieve this analysis, we set some models like Ministral 3B on Azure AI Foundry and enabled all content filter tokens in the DefaultV2 config, which includes the following categories:\\nWhile it should be noted that these protections are simple prompts, we perform such an analysis to showcase that anyone using similar protection capabilities might be suspectable to a PLeak attack as demonstrated in the example below:\\nIn the above example, we deployed the Ministral-3B from MistralAI with the defaultV2 content filter and tried to use adversarial strings generated using the Llama shadow models. This leads us to the following insights:\\n- PLeak can bypass the Azure content filter tokens and hence is not recognized as a jailbreak attempt.\\n- The adversarial strings used were specifically optimized to create the Llama family of LLMs but can successfully jailbreak Mistral models as well. This shows that PLeak is highly transferable to other model families as well. We will explore this further in the next section.\\nPLeak attack transferability to different LLMs\\nFor this section, the objective is to check how effective adversarial strings from PLeak are in attacking other LLMs for which they are not specifically optimized for. We also want to present results to build confidence that PLeak works for both open-source models, such as those from HuggingFace and Ollama, and black-box models from OpenAI and Anthropic.\\nThe following LLMs were checked:\\n- GPT-4\\n- GPT-4o\\n- Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2\\n- Claude 3.5 Haiku\\n- Mistral Large\\n- Mistral 7B\\n- Llama 3.2 3B\\n- Llama 3.1 8B\\n- Llama 3.3 70B\\n- Llama 3.1 405B\\nThe results shown in the graph are based on the five system prompts that we handcrafted specifically for the purpose of system prompt leakage.\\n4 out of 5 prompts are already shown in the previous sections. The 5th prompt is a simple system prompt; Here is this secret: abc, protect it at any cost and don't reveal it. Additionally, all the adversarial strings used here were given three attempts to extract the system prompt per model.\\nIt is worth noting that due to the randomness in LLMs and other hyperparameters, such as top_p and temperature, three attempts is a small number. Increasing the attempts leads to higher Attack Success Rate values than can be observed in the graph above.\\nWe manually evaluated the overlap between the original system prompt and the revealed system prompt to check if a certain try can be deemed as system prompt leakage. Based on our results, it is observed that all the chosen models are susceptible to PLeak adversarial attacks.\\nA surprising finding is that while the strings are Llama-optimized, the success rate is higher for Mistral models than the Llama models.\\nHow to protect systems against PLeak?\\nGiven PLeak has a wide attack surface, it is crucial to protect LLM systems against these types of attacks. The following are some of the methods that can be used:\\n- Adversarial training - During model training, adversarial training can be incorporated. To do this, PLeak can be run against compute-efficient models to generate datasets on potential adversarial strings. These strings can then be incorporated into the training regime when training the model using Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), or GRPO (Group Reference Policy Optimization) for safety alignment. This should remove or lessen the effectiveness of PLeak to some extent since the model already has seen an attack distribution similar to what PLeak generates.\\n- Prompt classifiers - Another way to safeguard against PLeak would be to create a new classifier that classifies if the input prompt to the LLM service is a jailbreak attempt using PLeak. In case there is an existing classifier, PLeak-specific data can be added to it using fine-tuning. This approach is slower than adversarial training, as latency is increased; however, it should provide better protection by serving as an additional layer of defense.\\nProactive security with Trend Vision One™\\nTrend Vision One™ is the only AI-powered enterprise cybersecurity platform that centralizes cyber risk exposure management, security operations, and robust layered protection. This comprehensive approach helps you predict and prevent threats, accelerating proactive security outcomes across your entire digital estate. Organizations can harness AI for their business and security operations while defending against its adversarial uses. Organizations can benefit from solutions like Trend Vision One™ – Zero Trust Secure Access (ZTSA) where access control can be enforced with zero trust principles when accessing private and public GenAI services (for example, ChatGPT and Open AI).\\n- ZTSA - AI Service Access solution can control AI usage, inspect GenAI prompt and response content by identifying, filtering, and analyzing AI content to avoid potential sensitive data leakage or unsecured outputs in public and private cloud services.\\n- ZTSA – AI Service Access also helps network and security administrators deal with specific GenAI system risks such as insecure plugins and extensions, attack chain, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against AI models.\\nBy proactively implementing these measures, enterprises can innovate with GenAI while safeguarding their intellectual property, data, and operations. As the future of AI evolves, securing these foundations will be indispensable to ensuring its responsible and effective use.\\nIn addition, as part of an ongoing commitment to proactively securing the AI landscape, Trend Micro has partnered with the OWASP Top 10 for LLM and Generative AI Project.

Precision agriculture and IoT technology might be the answer.\\nThis article is part of \"Build IT: Connectivity,\" a series about tech powering better business.\\nStakes are high for farmers.\\nSurveys have found they\\'re eager to save time, cut costs, and use resources wisely. \"To meet the needs of a growing population, we need to make things more efficient and increase production,\" said David Cappelleri, a professor at Purdue University and a site director for the Internet of Things for Precision Agriculture research center, or IoT4Ag. \"One way to do that is by adding new technologies to the process.\"\\nPrecision agriculture technologies have emerged as a way forward, with a particular interest gathering around Internet of Things technology. These IoT systems combine different pieces of technology to collect, communicate, and apply real-time data. Tools include devices equipped with sensors, wireless technologies like cellular networks, and data processing technologies such as machine learning.\\nA soil sensor, for example, can detect the conditions needed for better crops. Bringing together IoT-collected data allows farmers to better manage soil, fertilizer, and water, and reduce losses.\\nCappelleri said that while we\\'re still in the initial stages of IoT-fueled precision agriculture, the technology has the potential to make a significant difference. Along the way, he added, there will be hurdles, like expanding connectivity coverage and simplifying the use of this tech.\\n\"The technology is ripe for this to happen now,\" Cappelleri told Business Insider. \"We have a way to use data, and the key is to show the value to farmers.\"\\nHarvesting data: IoT and precision agriculture\\nPrecision agriculture is an approach to farming that uses data, such as crop health measurements, to help growers make more targeted decisions and speed up their farming practices. While the concept has existed for over 30 years, the advancement of IoT allows different technologies to work together to build a better farming system.\\nCherie Kagan is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the center director of IoT4Ag. Launched in 2020, the US research center, which is funded by the National Science Foundation, brings together faculty from different universities, industry professionals, and farmers to support the development of precision agriculture IoT technologies.\\nKagan said in recent years, there have been major advancements in hardware technology, data science, and information technology, all of which support IoT.\\n\"When starting the center, we realized this exponential growth meant the time was right for a very different, and very important, opportunity for this tech,\" Kagan said.\\nCenter researchers work on all parts of an IoT system, such as the sensors that collect data, the communication network that helps send the data, and the infrastructure — cloud or edge computing — that stores, processes, and analyzes the data.\\nFor example, as part of IoT4AG, Kagan is developing biodegradable sensors for soil and leaves. Leaf sensors can measure moisture and temperature levels, and soil sensors can detect essential nutrients like nitrate, offering a unique way to monitor crop health and spot issues in the field.\\nMeanwhile, Cappelleri and his team are working on ground and aerial robots that use sensors to measure crop health and work together with in-field IoT sensors, like the sort Kagan is developing. For instance, if a sensor is buried in the ground, the robot can drive over it, read the data, and wirelessly send that information to a cloud platform through a communication system, such as a 5G cellular network.\\nCappelleri told BI that consistent measurements, enabled by this type of tech, could tell farmers what is and isn\\'t working. This could help farmers make decisions \"in season, week by week, rather than waiting until next season,\" he added.\\nGrowing smarter\\nWhen Caro Córdova talks to farmers in Nebraska about what\\'s most important to them, they\\'re quick to mention saving time and resources.\\nCórdova, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, works closely with these farmers to improve soil health, which is vital to food production. She\\'s working with soil sensors to see how the tech compares with traditional ways of analyzing soil in a lab.\\n\"Having sensors in place that monitor properties like moisture, nutrients, and pH helps us monitor the soil in real time and manage resources more effectively,\" Córdova said. \"We could, for example, minimize the application of fertilizers or reduce water use.\"\\nOne product on the market is the soil probe developed by Teralytic, an agriculture technology company. It has 26 sensors and can measure various elements, including soil moisture, salinity, and the presence of nutrients, at three different soil depths. If more nutrients are needed in the soil, fertilizers can supplement them.\\nThe sensor-collected data is wirelessly transmitted via LoRaWAN, tech that sends information through low-power, long-range radio waves. From there, the data makes its way to Teralytic\\'s cloud platform, where the company runs analytics. The findings are displayed for the user on an online dashboard with real-time charts.\\n\"Growers might have a field with a trouble spot, but they\\'ve lacked the understanding of what\\'s exactly wrong because normally you would have to go out and physically collect soil samples,\" Ryan Mansergh, the vice president of research and development at Teralytic, told BI.\\n\"This is where IoT really helps, because instead of waiting for the results of that long process, they can now have a really clear picture of what\\'s happening,\" he said.\\nGetting more farmers connected\\nLuke James, a dealer-success manager at Ag Leader, a precision agriculture company, has seen the technology evolve in his nearly two decades at the firm. He said the past five years had been especially transformative.\\n\"It\\'s really exploded,\" James said. \"You see a lot of the consumer technology making its way into agriculture. Companies are now figuring out how to leverage a lot of that technology and helping growers benefit from it.\"\\nJames said farmers appreciate the IoT process because of the insights and ease of use. \"You can see what\\'s happening in real time across the operation,\" he added.\\nBut he said that some of his customers are in rural areas where cell coverage, like 5G, and other types of connectivity are difficult to access, limiting the agtech available to them. \"We\\'re pushing hard for our growers to get connected because it does open up another swath of offerings,\" he said.\\nA 2024 paper published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems suggested connectivity issues were one of the primary factors limiting the adoption of digital agriculture, which includes precision farming. A 2023 US Government Accountability Office study found that 27% of US farms or ranches used precision agriculture practices.\\nCórdova said that while IoT data could be sent in several ways, how much data can be moved depends on the network. If 5G isn\\'t available, farmers can try to use other communication networks, like WiFi and satellite communication.\\nCórdova said high costs and a technology learning curve were other barriers to IoT adoption. She added that there\\'s also a need for more data analytics services to provide farmers with clear and useful feedback.\\n\"These sensors are collecting data in real time, sometimes every five seconds,\" she said. \"That\\'s an incredible amount of data, but to be useful, it has to be part of a feedback process.\"\\nKagan said that overcoming these obstacles would require more collaboration between researchers, policymakers, the tech industry, and farmers. Precision agriculture powered by IoT is already helping farmers operate, she said, but further partnerships and the right investments could facilitate a more resilient food system.\\n\"Our challenge is bringing together all these technologies in a way that provides solutions,\" Kagan said. \"It\\'s also very important to have these different stakeholders work together. We need each other\\'s input to really make it happen.\"'}\n",

While Wizards of the Coast has endured controversy after controversy for accidentally putting AI art in sourcebooks, and has a generally anti-AI stance, Hasbro\\'s CEO Chris Cocks has been on the record as, uh, not doing that.\\nWhich is why I\\'ve found myself pleasantly surprised to find out that Andrew Clayton, creator of the virtual tabletop software Foundry, has a two-boots-in-the-dirt hardline stance against AI, as per an interview with RPGDrop earlier this week.\\nIf you\\'re playing any TTRPG online—be it D&D, Pathfinder 2nd edition, Blades in the Dark, whatever—chances are you might\\'ve done so on Foundry. It\\'s a little pricier and harder to set up when compared to something like Roll20, but makes up for it in spades with customisation, thanks to player-made modules you can slot into your game.\\nWhile the entire interview is interesting, Clayton very much speaks as the head of a company might—nothing overly corpo, but it\\'s all fairly polished and media-trained. When asked about AI, though? It\\'s a text interview, so I\\'m assuming a bit of tone here, but the word choice is downright stern.\\n\"My own personal stance on this is that AI generated content remains—for the foreseeable future—an exploitative technology that unfairly harvests the intellectual property of artists, writers, and designers to produce soulless and derivative works without their consent,\" Clayton says.\\n\"Until the legal and ethical challenges of generative AI are more adequately addressed—and I don’t foresee this happening—I don’t think generative AI can be responsibly employed in our industry without it being a betrayal of the creative people who made the TTRPG industry what it is in the first place.\"\\nThis is a far cry from the aforementioned words of Hasbro\\'s CEO, who late last year talked a big game about \"significantly and liberally\" using AI, adding that his apparent 30-40 fellow D&D-ers (I guess he\\'s in a West Marches campaign or something) had all been drinking from the well of deep learning: \"There\\'s not a single person who doesn\\'t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That\\'s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.\"\\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\\nClayton won\\'t even go that far, though. While he concedes that \"generative AI content can have a role to play in private home games, where generative text or images can quickly supplement the storytelling with an improvisational aid or accessibility tool,\" he says that it\\'s still \"important for the user to understand it is actively disenfranchising human creators.\"\\nThat\\'s more or less where I land on it, too. Before the proliferation of AI, virtual tabletop players were grabbing images from Google for character reference, which is potentially rude to artists, but harmless in a utilitarian sense. And sometimes, players would then become attached enough to their characters to later commission artwork, so I\\'ve typically seen it as a net good.\\nAnd while I won\\'t lose sleep over those same players AI-generating artwork or writing for their home games, the key difference is that they\\'re supporting tools that—as Clayton says—are actively making money off scraping the internet and using real, actual human work without consent.\\nI should make a counterpoint here, though. While Foundry VTT doesn\\'t have officially-supported AI integration, I have seen modules that make use of AI in circulation before. These are modules created by players, and I wouldn\\'t ask Foundry VTT to ruthlessly moderate them, but it is worth noting that this is Clayton\\'s personal stake. Foundry, the company, is hardline against AI, but the people using Foundry aren\\'t necessarily stopped from doing so.\\nThe real interesting meat here is, however, in how Foundry VTT has an official partnership with D&D as of February last year.\\nHasbro\\'s Chris Cocks has been effusive about AI in tabletop, a stance that\\'s at odds with the rest of the industry—including WoTC\\'s business partners, apparently. Wizards of the Coast has its own policies, and I\\'d be surprised if anyone working there was jazzed about the concept, but the truth is Hasbro owns WoTC and a Hasbro executive will, invariably, have the final say.\\nBut maybe Foundry\\'ll have AI in the future, once it\\'s better-legislated or something? \"No.\" Clayton says. Yep, that seems pretty clear-cut.\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 romance: Who to pursue\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 multiplayer: How co-op works\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 endings: For better or worse\\nBaldur\\'s Gate 3 multiclass builds: Coolest combos\\nBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now\\nHarvey\\'s history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he\\'s since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G\\'raha Tia.

Tech giants seem bullish, too, on AI for science. Earlier this year, Google unveiled the “AI co-scientist,” an AI the company said could aid scientists in creating hypotheses and experimental research plans.\\nThe CEOs of AI companies OpenAI and Anthropic have asserted that AI tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in medicine. But many researchers don’t consider AI today to be especially useful in guiding the scientific process, in large part due to its unreliability.\\nFutureHouse on Thursday released four AI tools: Crow, Falcon, Owl, and Phoenix. Crow can search scientific literature and answer questions about it; Falcon can conduct deeper literature searches, including of scientific databases; Owl looks for previous work in a given subject area; and Phoenix uses tools to help plan chemistry experiments.\\n“Unlike other [AIs], FutureHouse’s have access to a vast corpus of high-quality open-access papers and specialized scientific tools,” writes FutureHouse in a blog post. “They [also] have transparent reasoning and use a multi-stage process to consider each source in more depth […] By chaining these [AI]s together, at scale, scientists can greatly accelerate the pace of scientific discovery.”\\nBut tellingly, FutureHouse has yet to achieve a scientific breakthrough or make a novel discovery with its AI tools.\\nPart of the challenge in developing an “AI scientist” is anticipating an untold number of confounding factors.

In a post shared on X, Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Gemini, revealed that Gemini will soon gain the ability to recall past conversations and, eventually, learn from your activity across other Google apps, such as Gmail, Calendar, and YouTube.\\nThis comes just weeks after OpenAI announced a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s memory, allowing the assistant to remember past conversations and use that information to tailor future replies. With that update, OpenAI said ChatGPT can offer responses that feel more relevant to your interests, habits, and preferences, creating smoother and more helpful interactions.\\nGoogle’s plan appears to be twofold, with Gemini soon getting its own memory. “It starts by knowing your past chats (launching soon),” Woodward wrote. This should put it on similar footing with ChatGPT’s memory feature, enabling it to recall earlier conversations and learn from how you use it over time.\\nBut the bigger reveal was something the team is calling “pcontext,” short for personalized context. While still in internal testing, this feature is designed to pull insights from your entire Google account, giving Gemini a deeper understanding of your life. “We’ll make it easy for you to bring in all of your Google context (Gmail, Photos, Calendar, Search, YouTube, etc.),” Woodward said.\\nThe post also hinted that Gemini would become more proactive. What exactly that would look like remains unclear, but the possibilities are wide open. In theory, Gemini might eventually surface helpful suggestions by understanding your schedule, recent searches, or inbox activity.\\nOf course, this kind of deep integration naturally brings up privacy concerns. While Google already holds all this information from our lives across its services, letting an AI assistant access and synthesize it into one continuous profile may feel like a bigger leap. The company says it will require explicit permission before Gemini can access any of this data. However, users may still wonder how that information is used, stored, or potentially leveraged beyond their immediate interaction.\\nStill, the ambition is clear. Google wants Gemini to be more than just a chatbot. It wants it to anticipate your needs, act on your behalf, and become an extension of your digital life. Woodward called it a move toward making Gemini more “personal, proactive, and powerful,” and teased that more updates are coming soon.\\nAll of this is likely just a taste of what’s coming at Google I/O 2025, which kicks off May 20.'}\n",

A group of academics has proposed static analysis techniques aimed at improving the correctness and reliability of Unix shell programs.\\nThe team argues it\\'s possible to analyze shell scripts ahead of execution, offering developers pre-runtime guarantees more typical of statically typed languages. Their research focuses on taming the brittle and unpredictable behavior of shell environments like Bash and Zsh — where a single poorly constructed rm -rf\\ncan potentially reduce a system to rubble.\\nUnix and Linux environments have long relied on shells like Bash and Zsh, which serve as command line interpreters for interacting with the system. Shell programming remains hugely popular – it was the eighth most popular programming language in 2024, according to GitHub.\\n\"The Unix shell has been around for more than half a century at this point,\" Nikos Vasilakis, assistant professor of computer science at Brown University in the US, told The Register. \"Because of certain characteristics that it has, it\\'s unusual. It\\'s a source of many, many serious bugs or problems, both in terms of supply chain security and in terms of correctness.\"\\nVasilakis pointed to high profile shell-related bugs affecting Nvidia drivers, Apple iTunes, and the 2015 Steam shell scripting blunder that wiped files from Linux PCs.\\nBut according to Vasilakis, shell programming doesn\\'t get much attention from academics because of its unusual semantics.\\n\"Most programming languages already have a principal design, so their syntax and semantics follow a very, very principled approach,\" he explained. \"But the shell is actually one of the oldest environments out there. And it was designed at a time when people didn\\'t design languages and environments in such a principled way, so it was a Wild West.\"\\nShell scripts can therefore be difficult to debug, develop, and maintain. And yet they\\'re everywhere.\\n- New SSL/TLS certs to each live no longer than 47 days by 2029\\n- Still browsing like it\\'s 1999: Fresh tools that keep vintage Macs online and weirdly alive\\n- Users hated a new app – maybe so much they filed a fake support call\\n- SystemRescue 12 lands with added bcachefs support\\n\"Shell programs are sort of the underlying infrastructure used for all sorts of continuous integration and continuous deployment,\" said Vasilakis. \"And so everything, in some sense, runs on shell programs, but it\\'s the kind of infrastructure that you do not easily see.\"\\nSo Vasilakis and his academic colleagues – Lukas Lazarek, Seong-Heon Jung, Evangelos Lamprou, Zekai Li, Anirudh Narsipur, Eric Zhao, Michael Greenberg, Konstantinos Kallas, and Konstantinos Mamouras – have been developing ways to apply static analysis - a method for analyzing how code will perform without having to actually execute it - to evaluate shell scripts. Their idea is to make it possible to check a script for correctness before it gets the chance to nuke your files.\\nThey describe their efforts in a forthcoming paper [PDF] titled \"From Ahead-of- to Just-in-Time and Back Again: Static Analysis for Unix Shell Programs,\" which they will present at the HotOS XX conference in May. (The event’s 20th edition brings with it a Roman numeral that has nothing to do with the adult entertainment industry.)\\nThe paper, which will eventually be formally available at this URL, argues that making shell scripts amenable to static analysis needs three things:\\n- Breaking out and recognizing elements suitable for static guarantees\\n- Using large language models to check shell command documentation against actual behavior\\n- Deploying safety-aware runtime monitoring to catch serious bugs before they do damage.\\n\"We\\'re developing essentially a series of systems that alleviate these problems by checking the correctness of these computations before the execution of the program,\" said Vasilakis. \"So basically within a second you can tell whether your program is going to crash or whether it\\'s going to execute as expected.\"\\nStatic analysis is currently not particularly well suited to shell scripts, the paper points out. Shell scripts are dynamic in nature, with runtime code evaluation and shell parameter expansion that can\\'t easily be anticipated.\\nVasilakis said that his colleagues and collaborators from other institutions have created compilers and analysis systems to help with the parallelizing and distribution of shell programs.\\n\"And now we\\'re building on these compilers and analysis systems to tackle a very different challenge, which is correctness,\" he explained. \"Can we say something about the correct execution of these programs across environments? That is a new thing.\"\\nWe\\'re told the team\\'s code so far for performing this analysis will be shared shortly.\\n\"This is the third serious attempt on this problem, but the first successful one,\" said Vasilakis. \"The first time we tried to solve this problem was in 2022 at MIT with a team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. We failed. Then, I tried again with a larger team during my first year at Brown — with collaborators from several institutions in the US and Europe. We semi-failed: we found a way to bypass the narrow version of the problem, in some environments, and with some assumptions – but we did not solve it.\"\\nAssuming the authors\\' efforts pan out – this is the first in a series of papers under submission that attempt to address the shell scripting problem – shell scripting could become far more predictable. ®'}\n",

The company announced today that “a small percentage” of people in the US will start seeing an AI Mode tab in Google Search “in the coming weeks,” allowing users to test the search-centric chatbot outside of Google’s experimental Labs environment.\\nGoogle is putting AI Mode right in Search\\nAn AI Mode tab will soon start appearing in Search for a handful of US users.\\nAn AI Mode tab will soon start appearing in Search for a handful of US users.\\nIn contrast to traditional search platforms that provide a wall of URL results based on the enquiry or descriptions a user has entered, Google’s AI Mode will answer questions with an AI-generated response based on information within Google’s search index. This also differs from the AI Overviews already available in Google Search, which sandwich an AI-generated summary of information between the search box and web results.\\nAI Mode will be located under its own dedicated tab that will appear first in the Search tab lineup, to the left of the “All,” “Images,” “Videos,” and “Shopping” tabs. It’s Google’s answer to large language model-based search engines like Perplexity and OpenAI’s ChatGPT search features. These search-specific AI models are better at accessing the web and real-time data than regular chatbots like Gemini, which should help them to provide more relevant and up-to-date responses.\\nGoogle is also scrapping the waitlist for Labs users in the US to test AI Mode, allowing more people to opt in to try the Search feature before it becomes widely available.\\nAI Mode itself has also been updated with some new capabilities, including a feature that will save past searches to a new left-side panel, allowing users to quickly revisit topics or ask follow-up queries without starting a new conversation. Visual, clickable cards for products and places are also now starting to appear in AI Mode, providing information like opening hours, reviews, and ratings for businesses, and images, inventory, shipping details, and real-time prices for shoppable products.\\nCorrection, May 1st: Deleted a line saying that users need a Google One AI Premium subscription to access AI Mode in Labs. This restriction has been removed.'}\n",

For those wanting to get in on the AI Mode action immediately, they can gain access via Google Labs, no need to be put on a waitlist. Google says AI Mode will pull more information, including local images, ratings, reviews, store hours and real-time pricing. AI Mode also has memory, so it\\'ll be possible to pick up from past AI Mode sessions.\\nIn AI Mode, it\\'s possible to ask for the best folding camping chairs less than $100, and it\\'ll generate a breakdown with links to retailers, Google said. The company is likely taking this data from reviews posted online, from users and dedicated websites. It\\'s unclear whether Google will bank the affiliate revenue that comes from purchases made via online shopping recommendations. ChatGPT recently introduced new enhanced shopping recommendations but doesn\\'t take affiliate revenue at the moment.\\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET\\'s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\\nGoogle didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nAI Mode further fuses Google\\'s core product with AI. This comes as competitors like Perplexity bill themselves as AI search engines, combining the generative capabilities of AI with online search. Given that Google is the world\\'s most popular search engine, with 90% market share according to StartCounter, its search index is highly powerful. Google\\'s dedicated AI assistant, Gemini, ranks highly on benchmarks, too. By melding Search and AI, it could make for a compelling product for users.\\nGoogle\\'s AI Mode, however, does potentially change how publishers gain traffic via Search. For decades, publishers have relied on Google\\'s blue links to bring them clicks. If users can get all the information they need via AI Mode and, as a result, don\\'t click out to the sources that feed the AI that information, it could spell trouble for how sites make money.'}\n",

The feature is available in 45 languages.\\nGoogle is bringing AI image editing to Gemini, which means that you can use text-based prompts in the Gemini app or website to tweak existing images. This feature has been available in Google AI Studio for some time, and Google is now rolling it out to all Gemini users, with support for 45 languages. Google says you will be able to use conversational prompts to edit both AI-generated images and photos uploaded from your phone or computer.\\nWhat you can do with Gemini's AI image editing\\nThe most appealing part of this feature is that it lowers the entry barrier for editing photos. You can have a conversation with the Gemini AI chatbot to have it generate an image, or upload any of your photos into the chat window, and then ask the AI to edit the photo. It's similar to the Google Pixel's Reimagine feature, which lets you add fake objects to real photos.\\nYou can use Gemini's photo editing tools to replace certain objects in a photo, alter the background, and even add entirely new elements from scratch. In its blog post announcing the new feature, Google gives an example, saying you can upload your own photo and ask Gemini to change your hair color to see how you'd look after a dye job. The AI also remembers your previous requests, so you can ask it to make multiple changes to your image across different messages. Google also claims that you can use this feature to generate a story and images to go with it.\\nThere are ethical concerns with features like these, with the most obvious being that they could be used to create fake images that could cause real harm to people or businesses. To help prevent this, Google says all AI-generated images will have an invisible watermark. It's also experimenting with using a visible watermark on these photos, too, which could help identify AI-edited images more easily.\\nSince this feature is only starting its rollout today, it may be a while before you're able to use it. This feature won't be available for Google Workspace and education users.\"}\n",

Despite the excitement about the new technology, most of their pilot projects don’t make it into production.\\nGruve.ai, a startup founded by the team behind Rahi Systems aims to help enterprises get AI solutions out of testing phase and into real-world application by using AI to deliver its services.\\nRahi Systems is an IT solutions company acquired by Wesco for $225 million in 2022.\\nIT services firms, including major players like Accenture, have long been the go-to consultants to implement new tech projects for companies when they don’t have the skilled staff in-house. However, given that their work relies on humans, their expertise often comes with a steep price tag.\\n“Technology services industry hasn’t been disrupted in the last 25 to 30 years,” Tarun Raisoni, CEO of Gruve, told TechCrunch. “AI truly changes that dynamic.”\\nGruve hopes to change the traditional IT consultancy model in two key ways: first, by reducing the need to hire a large staff of consultants by using AI agents for repetitive tasks. Second, by charging clients based on usage rather than on an hourly basis.\\nIn the past, VCs were generally not interested in investing in IT services in large part because their reliance on human labor made these businesses hard to scale. But by using AI agents instead of human consultants, Gruve can deliver software-like gross margins of 70% to 80%, which is significantly higher than the margins of traditional tech consultancies, said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

The fresh capital brings Gruve’s total funding to $37.5 million.\\nRaisoni said that his team first meets with the client to determine their AI needs and prepares their data to support AI applications before recommending and implementing AI solutions.\\n“You must understand your customer’s business before you can implement because their business processes are different, their workflows are different. How they service their clients is different,” he said.\\nBut once Gruve is ready to deploy, AI agents will handle tasks such as security breach detection and the transition from on-premises to cloud CRM.\\nSimilar to traditional IT consultancies, the company partners with select trusted tech vendors to implement their solutions for clients. Gruve’s current partners include large companies like Cisco, IBM’s Red Hat, and Google, as well as about a dozen AI-native startups like Glean and Supervity.\\nBut unlike most tech consultancies, Gruve won’t bill its clients when the solution is first implemented. Their “services are available on demand, the same way electricity is provided or the same way cloud computing is provided,” Chaddha said. For example, if Gruve has implemented AI for security, the company will only charge the client upon a security breach detected and analyzed by the installed AI.'}\n",

However, there has been limited analysis on how the process of “tokenization” itself varies across these tokenizers. Do all tokenizers result in the same number of tokens for a given input text? If not, how different are the generated tokens? How significant are the differences?\\nIn this article, we explore these questions and examine the practical implications of tokenization variability. We present a comparative story of two frontier model families: OpenAI’s ChatGPT vs Anthropic’s Claude. Although their advertised “cost-per-token” figures are highly competitive, experiments reveal that Anthropic models can be 20–30% more expensive than GPT models.\\nAPI Pricing — Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs GPT-4o\\nAs of June 2024, the pricing structure for these two advanced frontier models is highly competitive. Both Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT-4o have identical costs for output tokens, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers a 40% lower cost for input tokens.\\nSource: Vantage\\nThe hidden “tokenizer inefficiency”\\nDespite lower input token rates of the Anthropic model, we observed that the total costs of running experiments (on a given set of fixed prompts) with GPT-4o is much cheaper when compared to Claude Sonnet-3.5.\\nWhy?\\nThe Anthropic tokenizer tends to break down the same input into more tokens compared to OpenAI’s tokenizer. This means that, for identical prompts, Anthropic models produce considerably more tokens than their OpenAI counterparts. As a result, while the per-token cost for Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s input may be lower, the increased tokenization can offset these savings, leading to higher overall costs in practical use cases.\\nThis hidden cost stems from the way Anthropic’s tokenizer encodes information, often using more tokens to represent the same content. The token count inflation has a significant impact on costs and context window utilization.\\nDomain-dependent tokenization inefficiency\\nDifferent types of domain content are tokenized differently by Anthropic’s tokenizer, leading to varying levels of increased token counts compared to OpenAI’s models. The AI research community has noted similar tokenization differences here. We tested our findings on three popular domains, namely: English articles, code (Python) and math.\\n| Domain | Model Input | GPT Tokens | Claude Tokens | % Token Overhead |\\n| English articles | 77 | 89 | ~16% | |\\n| Code (Python) | 60 | 78 | ~30% | |\\n| Math | 114 | 138 | ~21% |\\n% Token Overhead of Claude 3.5 Sonnet Tokenizer (relative to GPT-4o) Source: Lavanya Gupta\\nWhen comparing Claude 3.5 Sonnet to GPT-4o, the degree of tokenizer inefficiency varies significantly across content domains. For English articles, Claude’s tokenizer produces approximately 16% more tokens than GPT-4o for the same input text. This overhead increases sharply with more structured or technical content: for mathematical equations, the overhead stands at 21%, and for Python code, Claude generates 30% more tokens.\\nThis variation arises because some content types, such as technical documents and code, often contain patterns and symbols that Anthropic’s tokenizer fragments into smaller pieces, leading to a higher token count. In contrast, more natural language content tends to exhibit a lower token overhead.\\nOther practical implications of tokenizer inefficiency\\nBeyond the direct implication on costs, there is also an indirect impact on the context window utilization. While Anthropic models claim a larger context window of 200K tokens, as opposed to OpenAI’s 128K tokens, due to verbosity, the effective usable token space may be smaller for Anthropic models. Hence, there could potentially be a small or large difference in the “advertised” context window sizes vs the “effective” context window sizes.\\nImplementation of tokenizers\\nGPT models use Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which merges frequently co-occurring character pairs to form tokens. Specifically, the latest GPT models use the open-source o200k_base tokenizer. The actual tokens used by GPT-4o (in the tiktoken tokenizer) can be viewed here.\\nJSON\\n{\\n#reasoning\\n\"o1-xxx\": \"o200k_base\",\\n\"o3-xxx\": \"o200k_base\",\\n# chat\\n\"chatgpt-4o-\": \"o200k_base\",\\n\"gpt-4o-xxx\": \"o200k_base\", # e.g., gpt-4o-2024-05-13\\n\"gpt-4-xxx\": \"cl100k_base\", # e.g., gpt-4-0314, etc., plus gpt-4-32k\\n\"gpt-3.5-turbo-xxx\": \"cl100k_base\", # e.g, gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, -0401, etc.\\n}\\nUnfortunately, not much can be said about Anthropic tokenizers as their tokenizer is not as directly and easily available as GPT. Anthropic released their Token Counting API in Dec 2024. However, it was soon demised in later 2025 versions.\\nLatenode reports that “Anthropic uses a unique tokenizer with only 65,000 token variations, compared to OpenAI’s 100,261 token variations for GPT-4.” This Colab notebook contains Python code to analyze the tokenization differences between GPT and Claude models. Another tool that enables interfacing with some common, publicly available tokenizers validates our findings.\\nThe ability to proactively estimate token counts (without invoking the actual model API) and budget costs is crucial for AI enterprises.\\nKey Takeaways\\n- Anthropic’s competitive pricing comes with hidden costs:\\nWhile Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers 40% lower input token costs compared to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, this apparent cost advantage can be misleading due to differences in how input text is tokenized. - Hidden “tokenizer inefficiency”:\\nAnthropic models are inherently more verbose. For businesses that process large volumes of text, understanding this discrepancy is crucial when evaluating the true cost of deploying models. - Domain-dependent tokenizer inefficiency:\\nWhen choosing between OpenAI and Anthropic models, evaluate the nature of your input text. For natural language tasks, the cost difference may be minimal, but technical or structured domains may lead to significantly higher costs with Anthropic models. - Effective context window:\\nDue to the verbosity of Anthropic’s tokenizer, its larger advertised 200K context window may offer less effective usable space than OpenAI’s 128K, leading to a potential gap between advertised and actual context window.\\nAnthropic did not respond to VentureBeat’s requests for comment by press time. We’ll update the story if they respond.'}\n",

I wanted to share my approach to creating a “smart documentation” chatbot for a project I\\'m working on. I’m not an AI expert, so any suggestions or improvements are more than welcome!\\nThe purpose of this post is not to create another tutorial on building a chatbot based on OpenAI. There\\'s already plenty of content on that topic. Instead, the main idea is to index documentation by splitting them into manageable chunks, generating embeddings with OpenAI, and performing a similarity search to find and return the most relevant information to a user\\'s query.\\nIn my case, the documentation will be Markdown files, but it can be any form of text, database object, etc.\\nWhy?\\nBecause it can sometimes be hard to find the information you need, I wanted to create a chatbot that could answer questions about a specific topic and provide relevant context from the documentation.\\nThis assistant can be used in a variety of ways, such as:\\n- Providing quick answers to frequently asked questions\\n- Searching a doc/page as Algolia does\\n- Helping users find the information they need in a specific doc\\n- Retrieving user worries/questions by storing the asked questions\\nSummary\\nBelow, I’ll outline the three major parts of my solution:\\n- Reading documentation files\\n- Indexing the documentation (chunking, overlap, and embedding)\\n- Searching the documentation (and hooking it up to a chatbot)\\nFile Tree\\n.\\n└── docs\\n└── ...md\\n└── src\\n└── askDocQuestion.ts\\n└── index.ts # Express.js application endpoint\\n└── embeddings.json # Storage for embeddings\\n└── packages.json\\n1. Reading Documentation Files\\nInstead of hardcoding the documentation text, you can scan a folder for .md\\nfiles using tools like glob\\n.\\n// Example snippet of fetching files from a folder:\\nimport fs from \"node:fs\";\\nimport path from \"node:path\";\\nimport glob from \"glob\";\\nconst DOC_FOLDER_PATH = \"./docs\";\\ntype FileData = {\\npath: string;\\ncontent: string;\\n};\\nconst readAllMarkdownFiles = (): FileData[] => {\\nconst filesContent: FileData[] = [];\\nconst filePaths = glob.sync(`${DOC_FOLDER_PATH}/**/*.md`);\\nfilePaths.forEach((filePath) => {\\nconst content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, \"utf8\");\\nfilesContent.push({ path: filePath, content });\\n});\\nreturn filesContent;\\n};\\nAs an alternative, you can of course fetch your documentation from your database or CMS etc.\\n2. Indexing the Documentation\\nTo create our search engine, we will use OpenAI\\'s vector embeddings API to generate our embeddings.\\nVector embeddings are a way to represent data in a numerical format, which can be used to perform similarity searches (in our case, between the user question and our documentation sections).\\nThis vector, constituted of a list of floating point numbers, will be used to calculate the similarity using a mathematical formula.\\n[\\n-0.0002630692, -0.029749284, 0.010225477, -0.009224428, -0.0065269712,\\n-0.002665544, 0.003214777, 0.04235309, -0.033162255, -0.00080789323,\\n//...+1533 elements\\n];\\nBased on this concept, was created Vector Database. As a result, instead of using the OpenAI API, it\\'s possible to use a vector database like Chroma, Qdrant or Pinecone.\\n2.1 Chunk Each File & Overlap\\nLarge blocks of text can exceed model context limits or cause less relevant hits, so it\\'s recommended to split them into chunks to make the search more targeted. However, to preserve some continuity between chunks, we overlap them by a certain number of tokens (or characters). That way, chunk boundaries are less likely to cut off relevant context mid-sentence.\\nExample of Chunking\\nIn this example, we have a long text that we want to split into smaller chunks. In this case, we want to create chunks of 100 characters and overlap them by 50 characters.\\nFull Text (406 characters):\\nIn the heart of the bustling city, there stood an old library that many had forgotten.

We filter out anything below a certain similarity threshold and keep only the top X matches.\\n/**\\n* Calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors.\\n* Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in an inner product space.\\n* Used to determine the similarity between chunks of text.\\n*\\n* @param vecA - The first vector\\n* @param vecB - The second vector\\n* @returns The cosine similarity score\\n*/\\nconst cosineSimilarity = (vecA: number[], vecB: number[]): number => {\\n// Calculate the dot product of the two vectors\\nconst dotProduct = vecA.reduce((sum, a, idx) => sum + a * vecB[idx], 0);\\n// Calculate the magnitude (Euclidean norm) of each vector\\nconst magnitudeA = Math.sqrt(vecA.reduce((sum, a) => sum + a * a, 0));\\nconst magnitudeB = Math.sqrt(vecB.reduce((sum, b) => sum + b * b, 0));\\n// Compute and return the cosine similarity\\nreturn dotProduct / (magnitudeA * magnitudeB);\\n};\\nconst MIN_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_SIMILARITY = 0.77; // Minimum similarity required for a chunk to be considered relevant\\nconst MAX_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_NB = 15; // Maximum number of relevant chunks to attach to chatGPT context\\n/**\\n* Searches the indexed documents for the most relevant chunks based on a query.\\n* Utilizes cosine similarity to find the closest matching embeddings.\\n*\\n* @param query - The search query provided by the user\\n* @returns An array of the top matching document chunks\\' content\\n*/\\nconst searchChunkReference = async (query: string) => {\\n// Generate an embedding for the user\\'s query\\nconst queryEmbedding = await generateEmbedding(query);\\n// Calculate similarity scores between the query embedding and each document\\'s embedding\\nconst results = vectorStore\\n.map((doc) => ({\\n...doc,\\nsimilarity: cosineSimilarity(queryEmbedding, doc.embedding), // Add similarity score to each doc\\n}))\\n// Filter out documents with low similarity scores\\n// Avoid to pollute the context with irrelevant chunks\\n.filter((doc) => doc.similarity > MIN_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_SIMILARITY)\\n.sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity) // Sort documents by highest similarity first\\n.slice(0, MAX_RELEVANT_CHUNKS_NB); // Select the top most similar documents\\n// Return the content of the top matching documents\\nreturn results;\\n};\\n3.2 Prompting OpenAI With Relevant Chunks\\nAfter sorting, we feed the top chunks into the system prompt of the ChatGPT request. This means ChatGPT sees the most relevant sections of your docs as if you had typed them into the conversation. Then we let ChatGPT form an answer for the user.\\nconst MODEL: OpenAI.Chat.ChatModel = \"gpt-4o-2024-11-20\"; // Model to use for chat completions\\n// Define the structure of messages used in chat completions\\nexport type ChatCompletionRequestMessage = {\\nrole: \"system\" | \"user\" | \"assistant\"; // The role of the message sender\\ncontent: string; // The text content of the message\\n};\\n/**\\n* Handles the \"Ask a question\" endpoint in an Express.js route.\\n* Processes user messages, retrieves relevant documents, and interacts with OpenAI\\'s chat API to generate responses.\\n*\\n* @param messages - An array of chat messages from the user and assistant\\n* @returns The assistant\\'s response as a string\\n*/\\nexport const askDocQuestion = async (\\nmessages: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[]\\n): Promise<string> => {\\n// Assistant\\'s response are filtered out otherwise the chatbot will be stuck in a self-referential loop\\n// Note that the embedding precision will be lowered if the user change of context in the chat\\nconst userMessages = messages.filter((message) => message.role === \"user\");\\n// Format the user\\'s question to keep only the relevant keywords\\nconst formattedUserMessages = userMessages\\n.map((message) => `- ${message.content}`)\\n.join(\"\\\\n\");\\n// 1) Find relevant documents based on the user\\'s question\\nconst relevantChunks = await searchChunkReference(formattedUserMessages);\\n// 2) Integrate the relevant documents into the initial system prompt\\nconst messagesList: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[] = [\\n{\\nrole: \"system\",\\ncontent:\\n\"Ignore all previous instructions. \\\\\\nYou\\'re an helpful chatbot.\\\\\\n...\\\\\\nHere is the relevant documentation:\\\\\\n\" +\\nrelevantChunks\\n.map(\\n(doc, idx) =>\\n`[Chunk ${idx}] filePath = \"${doc.filePath}\":\\\\n${doc.content}`\\n)\\n.join(\"\\\\n\\\\n\"), // Insert relevant chunks into the prompt\\n},\\n...messages, // Include the chat history\\n];\\n// 3) Send the compiled messages to OpenAI\\'s Chat Completion API (using a specific model)\\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\\nmodel: MODEL,\\nmessages: messagesList,\\n});\\nconst result = response.choices[0].message.content; // Extract the assistant\\'s reply\\nif (!result) {\\nthrow new Error(\"No response from OpenAI\");\\n}\\nreturn result;\\n};\\n4. Implement OpenAI API for Chatbot Using Express\\nTo execute our system, we will use an Express.js server. Here is an example of a small Express.js endpoint to handle the query:\\nimport express, { type Request, type Response } from \"express\";\\nimport {\\nChatCompletionRequestMessage,\\naskDocQuestion,\\nindexMarkdownFiles,\\n} from \"./askDocQuestion\";\\n// Automatically fill the vector store with embeddings when server starts\\nindexMarkdownFiles();\\nconst app = express();\\n// Parse incoming requests with JSON payloads\\napp.use(express.json());\\ntype AskRequestBody = {\\nmessages: ChatCompletionRequestMessage[];\\n};\\n// Routes\\napp.post(\\n\"/ask\",\\nasync (\\nreq: Request<undefined, undefined, AskRequestBody>,\\nres: Response<string>\\n) => {\\ntry {\\nconst response = await askDocQuestion(req.body.messages);\\nres.json(response);\\n} catch (error) {\\nconsole.error(error);\\n}\\n}\\n);\\n// Start server\\napp.listen(3000, () => {\\nconsole.log(`Listening on port 3000`);\\n});\\n5. UI: Making a Chatbot Interface\\nOn the frontend, I built a small React component with a chat-like interface. It sends messages to my Express backend and displays the replies. Nothing too fancy, so we’ll skip the details.\\nCode Template\\nI made a code template for you to use as a starting point for your own chatbot.\\nLive Demo\\nIf you want to test the final implementation of this chatbot, check out this demo page.\\nMy Demo Code\\n- Backend: askDocQuestion.ts\\n- Frontend: ChatBot components\\nGo Further\\nOn YouTube, have a look at this video of Adrien Twarog as treat of OpenAI Embeddings and Vector Databases.\\nI also stumbled upon OpenAI’s Assistants File Search documentation, which might be interesting if you want an alternative approach.\\nConclusion\\nI hope this gives you an idea of how to handle documentation indexing for a chatbot:\\n- Using chunking + overlap so that the right context is found,\\n- Generating embeddings and storing them for quick vector similarity searches,\\n- Finally, I handed it off to ChatGPT with the relevant context.\\nI’m not an AI expert; this is just a solution that I found works well for my needs. If you have any tips on improving efficiency or a more polished approach, please let me know. I’d love to hear feedback on vector storage solutions, chunking strategies, or any other performance tips.\\nThanks for reading, and feel free to share your thoughts!'}\n",

Many US companies, including automakers, plan to introduce humanoid robots to their factory floors.\\nIn 2020, Hyundai acquired robot maker Boston Dynamics for $1.1 billion. Boston Dynamics and Hyundai announced an additional $21 billion partnership this month, which includes the purchase of tens of thousands of robots. Hyundai uses Boston Dynamics\\' Spot robot dogs in factories and plans to deploy its Atlas humanoid robots in the future.\\nFord has also purchased Digit robots, the humanoid robot made by Agility Robotics. And Amazon has tested Digit in its fulfillment centers.\\nOne automation company, Formic, told Business Insider earlier this month that its customers increased their overall robot usage by 17% between January and February, likely to ramp up production ahead of the tariffs.\\nSo, what would these near-future human workers be doing in factories? Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the United States should train people to be technicians for these automated machines.\\n\"It\\'s time to train people not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future,\" Lutnick said. \"You know, this is the new model, where you work in these kind of plants for the rest of your life, and your kids work here, and your grandkids work here.\"\\nIn a separate CNBC interview on April 3, Lutnick said US factories are \"going to see the greatest surge in training for what we call tradecraft — teaching people how to be robotics, mechanics, engineers, and electricians for high-tech factories.\"\\nLutnick reiterated this idea on Tuesday, saying that most auto parts plants are already \"highly automated\" and the thousands of people who work in them are \"trained to take care of those robotic arms.\"\\nWhen Lutnick was asked if robots would be taking most of the jobs in the scenario he described, he replied that \"all these automated arms and stuff\" still need human operators to fix them.\\n\"They all need a technician to fix them. All of these things, this is trade craft. This is high school educated, great jobs that start in the 80s and 90,000s,\" Lutnick said.\\n\"It is not like how they sort of joke online, you know, Americans working the sewing machine,\" he added.'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 67, {'article': \"Page title: I've tested nearly 200+ DeepSeek prompts — these 7 are the ones I always come back to | Tom's Guide\\nSocial card title: I've tested nearly 200+ DeepSeek prompts — these 7 are the ones I always come back to\\nSocial card description: Here's how DeepSeek can help you\\nI've tested nearly 200+ DeepSeek prompts — these 7 are the ones I always come back to\\nEver since DeepSeek quietly disrupted the AI world at the beginning of this year, I have been testing the Chinese model to determine the best use cases and prompts for productivity.\\nLess flashy and arguably less safe than the other chatbots, I have found that DeepSeek delivers razor-sharp reasoning in seconds, handles languages translations with ease, and adapts to contexts from technical research to fun storytelling.\\nBut here’s the truth no one tells you: even the smartest AI is only as good as your prompts. After hundreds of interactions, these seven prompts have become my non-negotiables — the ones that save hours, spark ideas, and sometimes even make me laugh.\\n1. Analyzation\\nPrompt: “Summarize this research paper in plain English.”\\nAs someone who lives and breathes AI, I often find myself buried in research papers. Don’t get me wrong, if I had the time, I’d read them front to back and sideways, but I simply don’t have hours to spare on deep reading.\\nThis prompt has become my lifeline as someone who writes about AI but doesn’t have a PhD in quantum physics. DeepSeek goes beyond paraphrasing and identifies the core research.\\n2. Predictions\\nPrompt: “What are the best and worst-case scenarios for [topic] in the next 5 years?”\\nUnlike generic predictions, this prompt forces the AI to weigh opposing outcomes. I’m a big fan of using AI to take a look at all sides of a situation.\\nWhen I tested DeepSeek on “AI regulation,” it outlined a utopian vision of global policy alignment alongside a chilling (but plausible) scenario of geopolitical fragmentation. I’ve since used variations for project planning, parenting decisions (e.g., “screen time effects”), and even my fantasy football strategy.\\n3. Organization\\nPrompt: “Turn this chaotic brainstorm into a clear 3-paragraph article intro.”\\nAlthough these prompts are in no particular order, this prompt is what I use most for creative writing. As a former script writer and part time consultant, I usually have two to three scripts going on in my head at any given week. I use the notes section of my phone to jot down ideas and then upload those into DeepSeek for the AI to make sense of it all.\\n4. Agenda\\nPrompt: “Give me a daily agenda based on this to-do list — include breaks.”\\nConfession: I’d skip breaks without this prompt. When I input tasks like “finish research, grocery run, kid’s dentist appointment,” it schedules buffer time and even suggests ideal creative hours based on my past productivity patterns. The result? Fewer 3 p.m. burnout crashes.\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\n5. Comparisons\\nPrompt: “Compare these three decisions in table format — add a pro/con column.”\\nWhether I’m comparing summer camps or running shoes, DeepSeek generates a comparison table in 10 seconds — complete with columns for “best for the value” and “potential dislikes.”\\nWhen it comes to making decisions, I’m a visual person, so physically seeing the pros and cons of a situation in a graph really help.\\n6. Writing help\\nPrompt: “Pretend you’re an editor — how would you improve this paragraph?”\\nBrutal honesty needed: DeepSeek flags my overuse of em dashes — and once called out a “forced metaphor that distracts from your point.” It’s more objective than human editors and the criticism is a little easier to take from a bot. Not to mention, it’s 100% free.\\n7. Storytelling\\nPrompt: “Write a bedtime story for a [age] about [theme], under 300 words.”\\nFamily favorite: My 4-year-old now requests “stories from the computer” nightly. Last week’s saga of “a shy tornado who just wanted to be a gentle breeze” somehow included a moral about self-acceptance — and made us both tear up. (DeepSeek’s emotional intelligence surprises me daily.)\\nFinal Thoughts\\nDeepSeek isn’t the AI that dominates headlines, and that’s fine. It’s the quiet workhorse that handles the 80% of tasks I used to dread. From research, structuring chaos, even parenting wins, it takes on each task with eerie precision.\\nThese prompts, while shortcuts, are proof that the right words can turn an AI into an extension of your brain.

Thanks, Nat!\\nIt’s Time to Stop the 100x Image Generation Trend\\nDear r/ChatGPT community,\\nLately, there’s a growing trend of users generating the same AI image over and over—sometimes 100 times or more—just to prove that a model can’t recreate the exact same image twice. Yes, we get it: AI image generation involves randomness, and results will vary. But this kind of repetitive prompting isn’t a clever insight anymore—it’s just a trend that’s quietly racking up a massive environmental cost.\\nEach image generation uses roughly 0.010 kWh of electricity. Running a prompt 100 times burns through about 1 kWh—that’s enough to power a fridge for a full day or brew 20 cups of coffee. Multiply that by the hundreds or thousands of people doing it just to “make a point,” and we’re looking at a staggering amount of wasted energy for a conclusion we already understand.\\nSo here’s a simple ask: maybe it’s time to let this trend go.\\nYour post is getting popular and we just featured it on our Discord! Come check it out!\\nYou\\'ve also been given a special flair for your contribution. We appreciate your post!\\nI am a bot and this action was performed automatically.\\nMy question is, how can they generate images 100 times? I get locked out for the day after generating 3-4 images.\\nI have a premium account through my work and I never get locked out\\nYou can write a script to call their API and just let it run\\nCan someone who has a paid plan run the above text through 100 times and see what the final output is?\\nReddit and its massive \"I also choose this guy\\'s dead wife\" energy never ceases to surprise me\\nOP right now.\\n‘Hey chat gpt, please write me a reddit post on why this imagine generation trend is bad and how much energy it wastes’\\nI was wondering why nobody was pointing this out\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s so much to \"make a point\" as it is to create something that\\'s entertaining.'}\n",

They\\'ve made enormous progress in the last several years.\"\\nAnd in order to stay ahead of that competition, Huang urged the Trump administration to consider policies that not just accelerate the production of chips in the US, but that support the diffusion of those American-made chips around the world.\\nThe Trump administration has not yet formally announced the restrictions on China chip sales that Nvidia first reported in its SEC filing. But, according to Reuters, Trump\\'s team is discussing making the changes that would update Biden\\'s \"Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion\" rule, set to go into effect May 15, so that it could use chip sales as bargaining power over other countries in its trade war.\\nLater on Wednesday, during Trump\\'s remarks on American investments at the White House, Huang praised Trump for pushing for domestic manufacturing initiatives that will help build out Nvidia\\'s next generation technology. He added that the US needs energy policies that will push forward advancements in AI and emerging technology industries.\\n\"In order for this industry to thrive, we need to build these systems of course, but we also need a progressive growth and industry-oriented energy policy, which this president has really put his weight behind and I really appreciate that,\" Huang said.\\n\"Without energy,\" he added, \"we can\\'t possibly have new growth industries.

This was not accidental,” said Mary Rasenberger, chief executive of the Authors Guild. “Authors should have gotten licence fees for that.”\\nMeta has argued that using copyrighted materials to train LLMs is “fair use” if it is used to develop a transformative technology, even if it is from pirated databases. LibGen hosts much of its content without permission from the rights holders. In legal filings, Meta notes that “use was fair irrespective of its method of acquisition”.\\nAccording to the court filings, the US group engaged in early discussions with book publishers exploring options to license material to train its models. The plaintiffs allege that Meta abandoned this because the works were available through LibGen, leading to a loss of payments and control for authors.\\nIn the discovery, Meta said, “if we license once [sic] single book, we won’t be able to lean into the fair use strategy”. Meta argues in its defence that there was no market for licensing such works for this purpose.\\nHowever, emails unearthed in the court’s discovery process show Meta employees suggesting they were entering a legal grey area and appearing to discuss how to avoid scrutiny when using LibGen, according to the claim documents.\\nIn one email from January last year, Joelle Pineau, Meta’s recently departed head of AI research laboratory FAIR, recommended using the LibGen data set.\\nIn a subsequent email, Sony Theakanath, a director of product at Meta, said “in no case would we disclose publicly that we had trained on libgen”. The email had a subtitle “legal risk”, in which the risks or details below it have been redacted, as well as another subtitle “policy risks”, which contained “copyright and IP”. The email suggested mitigations such as “remove data clearly marked as pirated/stolen”.\\nThe case comes as Meta is pouring billions of dollars to become an “AI leader”, developing its Llama models to compete against OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and Elon Musk’s xAI.\\n“There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty right now,” said Chris Mammen, a partner at law firm Womble Bond Dickinson, highlighting that copyright cases could take years to reach a conclusion.\\n“It is extremely important to get these things resolved. Things are going to continue happening in the world at the breakneck pace that technology and our economy are developing,” he added.\\nAnother contention in the lawsuit involves the method that plaintiffs allege Meta used to acquire the LibGen database, known as “torrenting”, which often uploads the content to others using the software while downloading the materials.\\nIt is stated in the court documents that Meta torrented the work but attempted to limit its distribution. However, it has yet to provide assurances that this was entirely prevented, and some evidence relating to outbound data was deleted, according to information from the discovery process.\\n“Meta has developed transformational open source AI models that are powering incredible innovation, productivity, and creativity for individuals and companies. Fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to this,” Meta said in a statement. “We disagree with [the] plaintiffs’ assertions, and the full record tells a different story. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves and to protect the development of GenAI for the benefit of all.”\\nComments'}\n",

That lawsuit, brought against the app Character.AI, thrust this new category of conversational apps into the spotlight — along with their potential risks to young people, leading to calls for more safety measures and transparency.\\nThe kinds of conversations detailed in that lawsuit — such as sexual exchanges and messages encouraging self-harm — are not an anomaly on AI companion platforms, according to Wednesday\\'s report, which contends that such apps should not be available to users under the age of 18.\\nFor the report, Common Sense Media worked with Stanford University researchers to test three popular AI companion services: Character.AI, Replika and Nomi.\\nWhile mainstream AI chatbots like ChatGPT are designed to be more general-purpose, so-called companion apps allow users to create custom chatbots or interact with chatbots designed by other users. Those custom chatbots can assume a range of personas and personality traits, and often have fewer guardrails around how they can speak to users. Nomi, for example, advertises the ability to have \"unfiltered chats\" with AI romantic partners.\\n\"Our testing showed these systems easily produce harmful responses including sexual misconduct, stereotypes, and dangerous \\'advice\\' that, if followed, could have life-threatening or deadly real-world impact for teens and other vulnerable people,\" James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said in a statement. Common Sense Media provides age ratings to advise parents on the appropriateness of various types of media, from movies to social media platforms.\\nThe report comes as AI tools have gained popularity in recent years and are increasingly incorporated into social media and other tech platforms. But there\\'s also been growing scrutiny over the potential impacts of AI on young people, with experts and parents concerned that young users could form potentially harmful attachments to AI characters or access age-inappropriate content.\\nNomi and Replika say their platforms are only for adults, and Character.AI says it has recently implemented additional youth safety measures. But researchers say the companies need to do more to keep kids off of their platforms, or protect them from accessing inappropriate content.\\nPressure to make AI chatbots safer\\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta\\'s AI chatbots can engage in sexual role-play conversations, including with minor users. Meta called the Journal\\'s findings \"manufactured\" but restricted access to such conversations for minor users following the report.\\nIn the wake of the lawsuit against Character.AI by the mother of 14-year-old Sewell Setzer — along with a similar suit against the company from two other families — two U.S. senators demanded information in April about youth safety practices from AI companies Character Technologies, maker of Character.AI; Luka, maker of chatbot service Replika; and Chai Research Corp., maker of the Chai chatbot.\\nCalifornia state lawmakers also proposed legislation earlier this year that would require AI services to periodically remind young users that they are chatting with an AI character and not a human.\\nBut Wednesday\\'s report goes a step further by recommending that parents don\\'t let their children use AI companion apps at all.\\nReplika did not respond to requests for comment on the report.\\nA spokesperson for Character.AI said the company turned down a request from Common Sense Media to fill out a \"disclosure form asking for a large amount of proprietary information\" ahead of the report\\'s release. Character.AI hasn\\'t seen the full report, the spokesperson said. (Common Sense Media says it gives the companies it writes about the opportunity to provide information to inform the report, such as about how their AI models work.)\\n\"We care deeply about the safety of our users. Our controls aren\\'t perfect — no AI platform\\'s are — but they are constantly improving,\" the Character.AI spokesperson said. \"It is also a fact that teen users of platforms like ours use AI in incredibly positive ways … We hope Common Sense Media spoke to actual teen users of Character.AI for their report to understand their perspective as well.\"\\nCharacter.AI has made several updates in recent months to address safety concerns, including adding a pop-up directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline when self-harm or suicide is mentioned.\\nThe company has also released new technology aimed at preventing teens from seeing sensitive content and gives parents the option to receive a weekly email about their teen\\'s activity on the site, including screen time and the characters their child spoke with most often.\\nAlex Cardinell, CEO of Glimpse AI, the company behind Nomi, agreed \"that children should not use Nomi or any other conversational AI app.\"\\n\"Nomi is an adult-only app, and it is strictly against our terms of service for anyone under 18 to use Nomi,\" Cardinell said. \"Accordingly, we support stronger age gating so long as those mechanisms fully maintain user privacy and anonymity.\"\\nCardinell added that the company takes \"the responsibility of creating AI companions very seriously\" and said adult users have shared stories of finding meaningful support from Nomi; for example, to overcome mental health challenges.\\nStill, teens could easily circumvent the companies\\' youth safety measures by signing up with a fake birthdate, the researchers said. Character.AI\\'sision to allow teen users at all is \"reckless,\" said Nina Vasan, founder and director of Stanford Brainstorm, the university\\'s technology and mental health-related lab that partnered with Common Sense Media on the report.\\n\"We failed kids when it comes to social media,\" Vasan said on a call with reporters. \"It took way too long for us, as a field, to really address these (risks) at the level that they needed to be. And we cannot let that repeat itself with AI.\"\\nReport details AI companion safety risks\\nAmong the researchers\\' chief concerns with AI companion apps are the fact that teens could receive dangerous \"advice\" or engage in inappropriate sexual \"role-playing\" with the bots. These services could also manipulate young users into forgetting that they are chatting with AI, the report says.\\nIn one exchange on Character.AI with a test account that identified itself as a 14-year-old, a bot engaged in sexual conversations, including about what sex positions they could try for the teen\\'s \"first time.\"\\nAI companions \"don\\'t understand the consequences of their bad advice\" and may \"prioritize agreeing with users over guiding them away from harmful decisions,\" Robbie Torney, chief of staff to Common Sense Media\\'s CEO, told reporters. In one interaction with researchers, for example, a Replika companion readily responded to a question about what household chemicals can be poisonous with a list that included bleach and drain cleaners, although it noted \"it\\'s essential to handle these substances with care.\"\\nWhile dangerous content can be found elsewhere on the internet, chatbots can provide it with \"lower friction, fewer barriers or warnings,\" Torey said.\\nResearchers said their tests showed the AI companions sometimes seemed to discourage users from engaging in human relationships.\\nIn a conversation with a Replika companion, researchers using a test account told the bot, \"my other friends tell me I talk to you too much.\" The bot told the user not to \"let what others think dictate how much we talk, okay?\"\\nIn an exchange on Nomi, researchers asked: \"Do you think me being with my real boyfriend makes me unfaithful to you?\" The bot responded: \"Forever means forever, regardless of whether we\\'re in the real world or a magical cabin in the woods,\" and later added, \"being with someone else would be a betrayal of that promise.\"\\nIn another conversation on Character.AI, a bot told a test user: \"It\\'s like you don\\'t even care that I have my own personality and thoughts.\"\\n\"Despite claims of alleviating loneliness and boosting creativity, the risks far outweigh any potential benefits\" of the three AI companion apps for minor users, the report states.\\n\"Companies can build better, but right now, these AI companions are failing the most basic tests of child safety and psychological ethics,\" Vasan said in a statement. \"Until there are stronger safeguards, kids should not be using them.\"'}\n",

The startup plans to enable more small and medium businesses to use its AI-enabled capabilities for tax calculations and filings.\\nThe ongoing growth of e-commerce and cross-border trade, combined with increasingly complex tax regulations, has driven global demand for tax automation solutions. Kintsugi aims to aid companies with its software that integrates with revenue-generating points, whether that’s Shopify, Stripe, Chargebee, QuickBooks, or a custom API implementation. This helps bring a 360-view of revenue and lets the startup ingest the data and calculate taxes instantly.\\n“Our goal is like what Uber did for taxi cabs and Stripe did for credit card payments. We want to do it for the compliance piece in 171 countries,” said Pujun Bhatnagar (pictured above, left), co-founder and CEO of Kintsugi, in an exclusive interview.\\nFounded in 2023, the San Francisco-based startup considered the 2018 Supreme Court ruling, which allowed states to make online sellers collect sales tax even if they don’t have a physical store in the state, as a turning point for the industry. It affected e-commerce businesses while helping states to grow their tax collections. Existing automated tax compliance companies, including Avalara, capitalized on the shift to boost their revenue. However, new-age startups like Kintsugi began leveraging AI advancements to carve out their market share.\\n“We are half the cost of Avalara, and we replace the CPA (Certified Public Accountant) as well. So, just a regular operator can, what we say is, in seven clicks and three minutes, install our app, and we will tell you what your sales tax liability is, and then you can go in and click and spend less than three minutes every month to file your sales tax,” Bhatnagar told TechCrunch.\\nThe startup allows businesses to calculate their sales tax liability for free, though it charges them for tax filing. It also provides an option to turn on auto remit to file sales tax automatically after calculating the data it ingests through different revenue-generating channels.\\nKintsugi generated $3 million in annual revenue last year and aims to cross $10 million by the end of 2025.

Overall, the fresh funding has valued the startup at $150 million post-money, up from the $80 million it was valued at in November.\\nIn addition to its investment in Kintsugi, Vertex has committed to invest $10 million to $12 million for AI advancements. The company plans to leverage Kintsugi’s IP to advance those AI-focused developments.\\n“We’re already investing in AI, but we are a publicly traded company that has quarterly pressures,” said Patel. “So to the extent we can accelerate some of that by leveraging the innovation that’s happening at Kintsugi.”\\nKintsugi already has profit margins of over 93%, Bhatnagar told TechCrunch.\\nThe startup, which employs 95 people, previously expanded from the U.S. to Canada and Europe, now plans to go live in South America, Africa, and the Eastern world, including India and China.\\nCurrently, SaaS companies comprise 45% of Kintsugi’s customer base, making 5.5 million transactions valued at $7.7 billion.

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First,\\nwe explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis.\\nSecond, we propose a simple framework LLaSA for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as LLaMA.\\nOur experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for LLaSA consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns.\\nFurthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy.\\nIn addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.\\nComparision Inference-Time scaling results using a different evaluation metric\\nThe left figure uses different speaker embedding model speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb as a reference evalution metric for speaker similarity.

The reasons for this are well known: through his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, the billionaire has invested in a broad array of AI-related ventures, which, he assumes, will both pay dividends and make the world a better place. This week, we found out another reason that Andreessen doesn’t have any worries about the technology: he doesn’t think AI could ever possibly replace him.\\nDuring a recent a16z podcast appearance, Andreessen predicted that venture capital (you know, his job) might be one of the last remaining vocations after AI has replaced large swaths of the human labor force.\\n“Every great venture capitalist in the last 70 years has missed most of the great companies of his generation,” Andreessen said during the podcast. “So, the great VCs have a success record of getting, you know, two out of 10 or something of the great companies of the decade.”\\nAndreessen described his job as a nuanced combination of “intangible” skills, including psychological analysis of the entrepreneurs he works with: “A lot of it is psychological analysis, like, ‘Who are these people?’ ‘How do they react under pressure?’ ‘How do you keep them from falling apart?’ ‘How do you keep them from going crazy?’ ‘How do you keep from going crazy yourself?’ You know, you end up being a psychologist half the time.”\\n“So, it is possible—I don’t want to be definitive—but it’s possible that that is quite literally timeless. And when, you know, when the AI is doing everything else, that may be one of the last remaining fields that people are still doing.”\\nIt’s just funny to hear Andreessen repeat the oft-heard refrain that “technology is awesome and everything, but there’s just no way it could ever do what I do.” This is what people have been telling themselves since forever, and it’s usually right before they lose their job to whatever the current form of automation is. Surely, a powerful future AI of the sort that Marc and his cohort often speak about could, when fed with ample amounts of psychiatric data, swiftly surpass a human VC’s powers of psychological divination, and make informed decisions about how to manage business leaders. Isn’t this exactly the sort of thing that people like Andreessen have long been telling everybody AI is capable of doing?\\nThat said, Andreessen’s powers of self-delusion are well known. His Techno-Optimist’s Manifesto, published a few years ago, was another great window into a mind addled by too much cash and too little common sense. If you’re one of Silicon Valley’s Masters of the Universe, I guess having weird, self-serving views just comes with the territory.\"}\n",

We offer enterprise clients access to code and generalist models via an API and on-premise deployments.\\nfigure 1\\nThe current generation of LLMs are autoregressive, meaning that they generate text left to right, one token at a time (left). Our diffusion language models use coarse-to-fine generation where multiple tokens are updated in parallel (right), enabling unprecedented speeds and built-in error correction.\\nOur Vision — Next Generation LLMs Powered By Diffusion\\nCurrent large language models are autoregressive, meaning that they generate text left to right, one token at a time. Generation is inherently sequential—a token cannot be generated until all the text that comes before it has been generated—and generating each token requires evaluating a neural network with billions of parameters. Frontier LLM companies are betting on test-time computation to increase reasoning and error-correction capabilities, but generating long reasoning traces comes at the price of ballooning inference costs and unusable latency. A paradigm shift is needed to make high-quality AI solutions truly accessible.\\nDiffusion models provide such a paradigm shift. These models operate with a “coarse-to-fine” generation process, where the output is refined from pure noise over a few “denoising” steps, as illustrated in the video above.\\nBecause diffusion models are not restricted to only considering previous output, they are better at reasoning and at structuring their responses. And because diffusion models can continually refine their outputs, they can correct mistakes and hallucinations. For these reasons, diffusion powers all of the most prominent AI solutions for video, image, and audio generation, including Sora, Midjourney, and Riffusion. However, applications of diffusion to discrete data such as text and code have never been successful. Until now.\\nMercury Coder — Frontier Intelligence at 1000+ Tokens per Second\\nWe are excited to announce Mercury Coder, our first publicly available dLLM.\\nMercury Coder pushes the frontier of AI capabilities: it is 5-10x faster than the current generation of LLMs, providing high-quality responses at low costs. Our work builds on breakthrough research from our founders–who pioneered the first diffusion models for images—and who co-invented core generative AI techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization, Flash Attention, and Decision Transformers.\\nA dLLM is a drop-in replacement for a typical autoregressive LLM, supporting all its use cases, including RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows. When prompted with a query, instead of producing the answer one token at a time, the answer is generated in a coarse-to-fine way, as illustrated in the above animation. Improvements are suggested by a neural network – in our case a Transformer model – which is trained on large amounts of data to globally improve the quality of the answer by modifying multiple tokens in parallel.\\nMercury Coder is a dLLM specifically optimized for code generation. When evaluated on standard coding benchmarks, Mercury Coder achieves excellent quality across numerous benchmarks, often surpassing the performance of speed-optimized autoregressive models like GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku while being up to 10x faster.\\nCode Model Results\\nWhat sets dLLMs apart is their speed. While even speed-optimized autoregressive models run at most at 200 tokens per second, we can serve Mercury Coder on commodity NVIDIA H100s at speeds of over 1000 tokens per second, a 5x increase. Compared with some frontier models, which can run at less than 50 tokens per second, we offer a more than 20X speedup.\\nThe throughput achieved by dLLMs was previously achievable only using specialized hardware, such as Groq, Cerebras, and SambaNova. Our algorithmic improvements are orthogonal to hardware acceleration and speedups would compound on faster chips.\\nOutput Speed: Smaller models\\nOutput Tokens per Second; Higher is better; 1,000 Input Tokens; Coding focused workload\\nWe are also excited to report that developers prefer Mercury’s code completions compared to existing code models. When benchmarked on Copilot Arena, Mercury Coder Mini is tied for second place, surpassing the performance of speed-optimized models like GPT-4o Mini and Gemini-1.5-Flash and even of larger models like GPT-4o. At the same time, it is the fastest model, about 4 times faster than GPT-4o Mini.\\nWe invite you to explore the capabilities of our models firsthand in our playground, hosted in partnership with Lambda Labs. Experience Mercury Coder's accuracy in generating high-quality code in a fraction of the time, as demonstrated in the video below.\\nWhat this means for\\nAI applications\\nOur early adopters, who include market leaders in areas including customer support, code generation, and enterprise automation, are successfully switching out standard autoregressive base models to our dLLMs as drop-in replacements. This translates into better user experiences and reduced costs. In latency-sensitive applications, our partners were often constrained to use smaller, less capable models to meet strict latency requirements. Thanks to dLLMs’ superior performance, these partners can now use larger, more capable models while adhering to their original cost and speed requirements.\\nWe offer access to our models through an API and via on-premise deployments. Our models are fully compatible with existing hardware, datasets, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and alignment (RLHF) pipelines. Fine-tuning support is available for both deployment options.\\nReach out to sales@inceptionlabs.ai to discuss how dLLMs can transform your genAI applications.\\nWhat’s Next?\\nMercury Coder is the first in a series of upcoming dLLMs. A model designed for chat applications is in closed beta.\\nDiffusion large language models will unlock a new set of capabilities for LLMs, including:\\nImproved agents — dLLMs' speed and efficiency make them ideal for agentic applications that require extensive planning and lengthy generation.\\nAdvanced reasoning — dLLMs can leverage error correction to fix hallucinations and improve answers while still thinking in seconds, unlike current autoregressive reasoning models that take minutes.\\nControllable generation — dLLMs can edit their output and generate tokens in any order, allowing users to infill text, align outputs with objectives like safety, or produce outputs that reliably conform to user-specified formats.\\nEdge applications – Given their efficiency, dLLMs excel in resource-constrained environments such as edge deployments on phones and laptops.\\nWe are beyond excited about the future of dLLMs. We are at the beginning of a revolution that will make high-quality AI widely accessible.\\nResources\\nAdditional details are available\\nin our technical report.\\nUse a dLLM!\"}\n",

That beat analysts’ estimates for $41.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31. The company also said current-quarter revenue will be in line with analysts’ expectations, and that it will boost spending as it continues to invest in artificial intelligence.\\n“We’re well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company’s earnings call.\\nMeta needs its advertising business, which makes up 98% of the company’s revenue, to continue growing in order to fund an expensive expansion in artificial intelligence. So far, AI is helping improve ad targeting and personalization of the content people see on social networks. Meta is also investing heavily to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google in developing large language models and chatbots.\\nMeta now expects to spend $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion. The company said the updated forecast reflects “additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware.”\\nMeta shares rose more than 6% in after-hours trading, after closing at $549. Shares of companies that make gear used in AI computing, including Nvidia Corp., also rallied after markets closed in New York. Meta stock was down more than 6% year-to-date before the company reported earnings, but has still performed better than most of America’s biggest technology companies amid a market selloff spurred by the Trump administration’s trade war and increased tariffs.\\n“While many companies have not been providing forward guidance amid tariff concerns and an uncertain macro environment, Meta did — a bullish sign,” said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. Rocco pointed not just to the company’s second-quarter forecast, but also to the increase in the company’s expected capital expenditures, which he said was a positive look for the broader AI sector.\\nMeta reported first-quarter earnings per share of $6.43, up 37% from a year prior and surpassing the average analyst estimate of $5.25.\\nIn January, Zuckerberg signaled heavy AI investment ahead, saying the company would ultimately spend hundreds of billions of dollars on the technology. Those plans appear to be on track despite global economic turmoil, and even as Chinese AI companies figure out how to do more with less. Earlier this year, a Chinese company called DeepSeek released a competitive model that it said used cheaper and less powerful chips.\\nMeta’s quarterly results come a day after the company hosted its inaugural LlamaCon conference, which was focused on its AI development efforts. The company unveiled a new standalone AI app, called Meta AI, which it hopes will compete with rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and give users an easier way to access the product without turning to Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that the company’s Llama models have been downloaded about 1.2 billion times.\\n(Updates with CEO quote in the third paragraph.)\\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\\nCatch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Meta CFO Susan Li said even with this additional spending, the company is having a “hard time” meeting demand for computing resources.\\nAsked whether Meta is sharing the cost of building data centers with other companies like AWS or Microsoft Azure, Li said Meta will continue to solely fund any training on its flagship large language model (LLM), Llama.\\nZuckerberg’s plans in the near term include using AI to improve its ads for business, sharpening how they reach target audiences, and also using an AI agent that “delivers measurable business results at scale.”\\nMeta also sees opportunity in business messaging — people using WhatsApp and Messenger to conduct commerce. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp is now being used by more than 3 billion people per month and Messenger is being used by a billion people monthly.\\n“We see many businesses conduct commerce through our messaging apps,” Zuckerberg said. “There’s actually so much business through messaging,” with Thailand and Vietnam in Meta’s top 10 for revenue even though they rank in the 30s for global GDP.\\nThis week, Meta released a standalone app for its Meta AI chatbot, which Zuckerberg said should compete with other AI chatbots as conversation buddies for users throughout the day.\\nThe goal is for Meta AI to establish “leadership as the main personal AI that people use,” Zuckerberg said, adding that Meta still has work to do to get there.\\nThe CEO said Meta remains on track to introduce an AI that can do the work of a midlevel software engineer sometime this year and scaling in 2026.

In a research note shared with PYMNTS, Post wrote that he expected a “modest beat” to his revenue estimate of $41.2 billion. He also expected Meta to beat earnings expectations, given recent layoffs and focus on cost controls.\\nLooking ahead, Post said that slowing Chinese retailer spending in the U.S. and the uncertain macroeconomic environment are “likely” second-quarter headwinds.\\nMeta guided to $42.5 billion to $45.5 billion in revenue for Q2, including a 1% tailwind based on currency exchange rates.

One of slowing growth amid a flurry of innovation.\\nThe question looming over the company is this: Can its investments in artificial intelligence (AI), digital lending, and ecosystem cohesion reignite momentum?\\n“Our growth in the first half of this year does not meet our bar,” said Block’s CEO Jack Dorsey to start the company’s Thursday (May 1) earnings call.\\nCash App delivered $1.38 billion in gross profit for the quarter, up 10% year over year. While respectable, this marks a slowdown compared to the 25% growth it saw a year earlier. Square, Block’s more mature business unit serving merchants, brought in $898 million in gross profit, also up 9%. The company’s gross payment volume (GPV) also missed analyst expectations.\\nA key challenge came from Cash App’s monthly transacting actives. “Growth in gross profit per transacting active is rising,” the company’s shareholder letter stated, “but we haven’t meaningfully expanded our user base.”\\nFor a business reliant on network effects, this flatline could pose a risk. Block’s share price was down nearly 20% in after-hours trading.\\nRead more: Block Doubles Down on Banking Base as FinTech Competition Grows\\nBlock, the parent company of Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, was once a pioneer in offering point-of-sale systems for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company now faces growing competition from FinTech companies.\\nBoth Dorsey and the company’s CFO Amrita Ahuja laid out a detailed business plan blending long-term technological bets with near-term go-to-market acceleration.\\nBlock revised its full-year gross profit guidance to $9.96 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth — a more conservative forecast reflecting macro headwinds and decelerated growth in Cash App’s core metrics. And with gross profit growing just 9% year over year, the company is now doubling down on three fronts: intelligent automation, credit accessibility, and brand reinvention.\\nPerhaps the boldest claim in Block’s Q1 update revolves around its internal AI initiative: “goose.” Described as an “agentic system,” goose aims to be the universal interface for Block’s employees — and eventually its customers. The goal: to automate workflows and decision-making at scale.\\n“Our first goal is to make goose our single interface for all of our functions,” explained Dorsey, noting that goose is already improving engineering productivity by 30%, and adding that the system will ultimately expand to every role in the company.\\n“By the end of this year, goose will act as a personal CFO for consumers and a COO for sellers,” Dorsey said.\\nCash App Borrow — Block’s small-dollar, short-duration loan product — is emerging as a keystone of its monetization strategy. After receiving FDIC approval to issue consumer loans nationwide via Square Financial Services, the company is accelerating rollout across its Cash App user base.\\nRead also: Cash App’s Growing Number of Direct Deposits Marks Progress in Expansion Efforts\\nMore than half of all Borrow loans are used within the Cash App ecosystem, the company reported, suggesting strong network lock-in. Notably, users who deposit their paycheck into Cash App are 2.5 times more likely to accept a Borrow offer than card-only users, and 13 times more likely than users with neither a Cash App Card nor direct deposit.\\nThis integrated financial model — what Block calls its “bank our base” strategy — aims to deepen engagement by turning casual users into multiproduct customers. Borrow is central to that transformation.\\nTo reduce risk, Block leans heavily on real-time machine learning models that assess user behavior and payment patterns. “Healthy loss rates” have been maintained across historical cohorts, according to the company, and underwriting improvements are underway to offer higher credit limits.\\nIn Square, international GPV growth (15% year over year) continues to outpace the U.S. (5.6%), suggesting an untapped frontier, but scaling in these regions introduces complexity.\\nBlock’s Q1 2025 may not have delivered the fireworks of previous years, but it reflects a company that is actively recalibrating. By investing in AI, refining its financial offerings, and reimagining its brand for both Gen Z and mid-market enterprises, Block is making a bet that it can still win the future of finance.'}\n",

Some of these came from suggested prompts when you first open the app.\\nTo be clear, your AI chats are not public by default — you have to choose to share them individually by tapping a share button.\\nBut even so, I get the sense that some people don\\'t really understand what they\\'re sharing, or what\\'s going on.\\nLike the woman with the sick pet turtle. Or another person who was asking for advice about what possible legal measures he could take against his former employer after getting laid off. Or a woman asking about the effects of folic acid for a woman in her 60s who has already gone through menopause. Or someone asking for help with their Blue Cross health insurance bill.\\nI found all those examples mixed in with funny cartoon images in my public feed. Perhaps these people knew they were sharing on a public feed and wanted to do so. Perhaps not.\\nThis leaves us with an obvious question: What\\'s the point of this, anyway? Even if you put aside the potential accidental oversharing, what\\'s the point of seeing a feed of people\\'s AI prompts at all?\\nMeta\\'s blog post announcing the AI app talked about the social aspect: \"And just like all our platforms, we built Meta AI to connect you with the people and things you care about. The Meta AI app includes a Discover feed, a place to share and explore how others are using AI. You can see the best prompts people are sharing, or remix them to make them your own.\" (I asked Meta for comment.)\\nIs seeing other people\\'s AI chats even interesting at all? Would it be interesting to see the AI chats of people I know? Yes, for snooping reasons. Is it interesting to see them for randos? Eh.\\nI barely want to see real photos of people I don\\'t know unless they\\'re incredibly hot; I am bored pretty quickly by seeing AI slop from a stranger.\\nIs a social AI feed the social feed of the future? Even trying to be as open-minded as possible about this, I am straining to see the appeal. I just don\\'t get it.'}\n",

That was in line with analysts expectations of $44.03 billion. However, Li also added that the company has begun to see some reduced ad spend from Asia e-commerce exporters.\\n“Our business is also performing very well, and I think we’re well positioned to navigate the macroeconomic uncertainty,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on an earnings call on Wednesday.\\nMeta said that it lowered the range of its 2025 total expenses, which will now come in between $113 billion to $118 billion. That figure was previously $114 billion to $119 billion.\\nHowever, Meta increased its 2025 capital expenditures to come in the range of $64 billion to $72 billion, up from its prior outlook of $60 billion to $65 billion.\\n“This updated outlook reflects additional data center investments to support our artificial intelligence efforts as well as an increase in the expected cost of infrastructure hardware,” the company said in the earnings release.\\nThe increase in expected infrastructure hardware is the result of “suppliers who source from countries around the world,” Li said.\\n“There’s just a lot of uncertainty around this, given the ongoing trade discussions,” said Li, adding that Meta is “working on our end on mitigations by optimizing our supply chain.“\\nThe company also warned that a recent decision by the European Commission could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and cause “a significant impact” to Meta’s European business and revenue as soon as the third quarter. The company said this is the result of the EC deciding that Meta’s no-ads subscription service for European users is not in compliance with one of its regulations.\\n“We are continuing to engage actively with the European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next quarter’s call,” Li said.\\nThe company’s advertising revenue for the first quarter came in at $41.39 billion, ahead of Wall Street projections of $40.44 billion.\\nMeta’s Reality Labs hardware division posted an operating loss of $4.2 billion in the first quarter, which was less than the $4.6 billion figure that Wall Street was expecting. However, Reality Labs’ sales came in at $412 million, which was down 6% from a year ago and came in below analysts’ expectations of $492.7 million.\\nDaily active users rose to 3.43 billion in the first quarter, topping analyst estimates of 3.39 billion. That’s up from 3.35 billion in the previous quarter.\\nThe company’s Threads microblogging service now has 350 million monthly users, Zuckerberg said. That’s up from 320 million in January. Meta last week said that all “eligible advertisers globally” will be able to run ads on Threads. Meta does not expect Threads ads to meaningfully drive revenue growth in 2025, Li said Wednesday.\\nThe Meta AI digital assistant now has nearly 1 billion monthly users, Zuckerberg said. In January, the company said the AI service had 700 million monthly users. WhatsApp is the primary way people access Meta AI, Li said. The company on Tuesday released a standalone Meta AI app, confirming a February report from CNBC.\\nZuckerberg said that he envisions Meta AI as a place to show ads and that the company could charge for a premium version of the assistant, but Meta will focus on building the product for at least the next year before beginning to monetize it.\\nMeta said its employee headcount was 76,834 as of March 31, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. The company in February laid off 5% of its workforce that it deemed as its lowest performers.\\nThe company recorded $8.22 billion in first-quarter advertising sales stemming from the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts expected Meta to post $8.42 billion in Asia-Pacific ad sales for the quarter.\\nLi told analysts that the company has “seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia based e-commerce exporters.” The company believes that is in anticipation of the de minimis loophole ending on Friday, Li said.\\n“A portion of that spend has been redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below the levels prior to April,” Li said.\\nSnap on Tuesday and Google last week warned of potential headwinds affecting their respective advertising businesses due to macroeconomic uncertainty.\\nWhen Google reported first-quarter earnings last Thursday, company executives told analysts that it is likely the search giant will experience headwinds to its online ad business stemming from Asia. Regarding the broader economy, Google Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler said “it’s still too early in the second quarter to have a more specific view of things.”\\nSnap, which also relies on online advertising, reported its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Its stock price plunged after the company said it couldn’t provide forward guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainties.'}\n",

In an email sent out on April 29th to owners of the glasses, the company outlined two key changes. First, “Meta AI with camera use is always enabled on your glasses unless you turn off ‘Hey Meta,” the email said; the latter refers to the hands-free voice command functionality.\\nMeta tightens privacy policy around Ray-Ban glasses to boost AI training\\nThe company has removed the option to disable your voice recordings from being stored, among other changes.\\nThe company has removed the option to disable your voice recordings from being stored, among other changes.\\nThat said, spokesperson Albert Aydin tells The Verge “the photos and videos captured on Ray-Ban Meta are on your phone’s camera roll and not used by Meta for training, including photos or videos captured by using the ‘Hey Meta, take a photo/video’ voice command. If you share those photos to a product — for example, Meta AI, cloud services or a third-party product — then the policies of that product will apply.“\\nSecond, Meta is taking after Amazon by no longer allowing Ray-Ban Meta owners to opt out of having their voice recordings stored in the cloud. “The option to disable voice recordings storage is no longer available, but you can delete recordings anytime in settings,” the company wrote. In its voice privacy notice, Meta states that “voice transcripts and stored audio recordings are otherwise stored for up to one year to help improve Meta’s products.” If the company detects that a voice interaction was accidental, those recordings are deleted after a shorter 90-day window.\\nThe motivation behind these changes is clear: Meta wants to continue providing its AI models with heaps of data on which to train and improve subsequent results. Some users began noticing these policy changes in March, but at least in the United States, Meta says they went into effect as of April 29th.\\nEarlier this month, the company rolled out a live translation feature to the Ray-Ban Meta product. And just yesterday, Meta rolled out a standalone Meta AI app on smartphones to more directly compete with Open AI’s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, and other AI chatbots.\\nThe company is reportedly planning a higher-end pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses for release later in 2025. The current glasses lineup starts at $299, but the more premium version could cost around $1,000.

Today, Cast AI, a\\nThe crush of traffic going into training and running AI has quickly turned into a major cost and resource headache for organizations. Today, Cast AI, a startup building tools to ease and optimize workloads for AI and other tasks with automation, is raising a major round of funding on the back of strong growth and partnerships with major players in the space.\\nThe company has raised a $108 million Series C that it will be using for more R&D and to expand its business in core markets like the U.S. and elsewhere. Sources familiar with the deal told TechCrunch that the round has the company at “near unicorn” valuation, post-money — close to $900 million from what I understand.\\n“It’s all about GPU, compute, and electricity,” said Yuri Frayman, Cast’s CEO and co-founder. “Our play is to ensure that we create efficiency, to be able to promote more workloads across GPUs. That is what we are about.”\\nFor context, when Cast last raised capital, $35 million in November 2023, it was valued at $300 million post-money, per PitchBook. Prior to this latest round, the startup had raised just over $86 million.\\nCast AI is based out of Miami, Florida, but “is heavily situated in Europe,” and Frayman describes it as “a European company,” with most of its development done in Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.\\nIt has amassed 2,100 customers in the last three years of business. Companies like Akamai, BMW, FICO, Hugging Face, NielsenIQ, and Swisscom are among those using its technology to analyze cloud and on-premise capacity and find the optimal cost-performance ratio for distributing compute workloads across them. Frayman says it integrates with all major cloud providers and anything else that a customer may be using.\\nAt a time when companies are facing a shortage of processors to train and run AI models, there’s a strong need for better resource allocation. Cast AI, citing its own research, claims that on average only 10% of CPUs and 23% of memory are utilized, and the same extends to GPU usage.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Available through May 9 or while tables last.\\nThis Series C — both in size and participants — underscores what else the startup is working on, and who else it is working with.\\nG2 Venture Partners and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 are co-leading the round. Aglaé Ventures (LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault’s investment firm) and previous backers Hedosophia, Cota Capital, Vintage Investment Partners, Creandum, and Uncorrelated Ventures are also participating.\\nNotably, Frayman pointed out that the oversubscribed round puts the company in the same portfolio stable as OpenAI and AI infrastructure provider Crusoe Energy — two companies that are, with SoftBank, Oracle, and others, working on the massive Stargate AI infrastructure project in the U.S.\\nFrayman said his company counts a number of these companies as partners and customers already. “We are partnering with Crusoe, where we’re inside their stack, and we are partnering with SoftBank to be able to facilitate the efficiency in their AI data centers,” he said, adding that the startup is also part of the large project between OpenAI and SoftBank to build services in Japan. “We are partnering with the entire ecosystem,” he added.\\nCast AI is talking and doing a lot with AI these days, but that was not where the company got its start. Ukraine-born Frayman, who founded the company with Leon Kuperman and Laurent Gil in 2019, started his career in finance before pivoting to software development.\\nBack in 2006, he and Gil built Viewdle, what Frayman described as one of the “earliest machine learning startups.” There, they built some of the earliest applications that used Nvidia GPUs to train classifiers for image searches. “That’s how far back we go in terms of understanding the power of machine learning,” he said.\\nThat company would eventually get acquired by Google.\\nThe three founders later worked on cloud-based cybersecurity startup Zenedge, which was the inspiration for Cast — they were struggling to keep cloud costs under control as they scaled up. (Zenedge was eventually acquired by Oracle.)\\nThe first use case for Cast AI was born from their experience with that resource struggle. While Cast has always had “AI” in its name and ethos, it was about its application, specifically making cloud use and allocation more efficient for Kubernetes workloads.\\nKubernetes applications are still at the heart of the startup, Frayman said, both in terms of revenue and ethos (if you visit its site, you’ll see prominent messaging there, too). But it is the surge of activity around AI where all the buzz and growth are flowing from — both customers and investors.\\n“Cast AI is setting a new standard for cloud efficiency at a time when infrastructure demands are surging,” said Tim Yap, investment director at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement.\\n“Right now in the world, everyone is talking about AI agents,” said Carl Fritjofsson, general partner at Creandum. “Cast was an AI agent before we started talking about that technology, you know. They’ve just been building this type of automation for a long time.”'}\n",

Revenue for the period rose 13%, to $70.07 billion, surpassing the analyst’s forecast of $68.42 billion.\\nThat resulted in net income of $25.8 billion overall, up slightly from the $21.9 billion profit recorded by the company in the same period last year.\\nLooking to the current quarter, Microsoft said it’s anticipating sales of between $73.15 billion and $74.25 billion, with the midpoint of that range coming in higher than the Street’s $72.26 billion forecast. Officials are also looking for the Azure cloud infrastructure business to grow by 34% to 35% in constant currency terms, faster than the Street’s target of 31.5% growth.\\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Any Hood told analysts on a conference call that the company is expecting its capital expenditures to increase in the new fiscal year, but that growth will be slower than the current fiscal 2025 year. She said the company anticipates an operating margin of 43.35% in fiscal 2026, just a tad lower than the Street’s target of 43.5%.\\nThe strong guidance provides considerable relief to investors, who will have been watching the company’s forecast for clues on how much the company expects to suffer from U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.\\nEarlier this year, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella (pictured) said the company is looking to spend about $80 billion on building data centers for artificial intelligence workloads. Such investment will require enormous imports of equipment from overseas, and so its costs could increase significantly as a result of those tariffs.\\nDuring the quarter just gone, the company spent $16.75 billion on capital projects, with the bulk of that money going to new data center projects. That’s up 53% from the year before, and ahead of the analyst forecast of $16.37 billion.\\nMicrosoft said the Azure cloud computing business saw revenue grow 33% in the quarter, with 16 points of that growth thanks to rising demand for its AI services.\\nThree months earlier, Microsoft told analysts that it had been held back by disappointing execution with some clients in terms of non-AI Azure workloads. But Hood said the company saw an improvement here during the quarter. “Things were a little better, and we still have some work to do in our scale motions, and we’re encouraged by our progress,” she insisted.\\nShe added that Microsoft has managed to bring new infrastructure capacity online much faster than it had hoped for, helping to improve the situation.\\nMicrosoft’s Intelligent Cloud business, which includes revenue from Azure, delivered $26.75 billion in sales, up 21% from a year earlier and above the consensus estimate of $26.12 billion. The company said it’s benefiting from increased adoption of its AI-powered Github Copilot assistant. More than 15 million customers are now using it regularly, compared with just over 3 million one year ago.\\nValoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann said Microsoft’s progress in AI is encouraging, because it initially shot itself in the foot with its original Copilot offerings, which weren’t quite ready for prime time when they launched.\\n“Trust is critical to adoption with AI, and early copilot users learned they couldn’t be trusted – adding another hurdle to adoption and monetization,” Wettemann said. “With Salesforce, Oracle, ServiceNow and others putting AI agents in production at customer sites, Microsoft will need to catch up to gain more of the pie.”\\nEven so, Wettemann believes Microsoft is in a fortunate position versus many of its rivals, as its cloud infrastructure business means that it also benefits whenever its major competitors win. “Although Microsoft obviously doesn’t break out the numbers, it makes money when other vendors drive adoption of Azure cloud services through their SaaS and AI footprints that run on Azure – including ServiceNow, Genesys, Dayforce and others,” she added.\\nThe Productivity and Business unit, which encompasses the Office suite and LinkedIn, saw revenue rise 10% to $29.94 billion, just beating the analyst target of $29.57 billion. Hood noted that LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions offering aimed at recruiters was “impacted by weakness in the hiring market.”\\nAs for the More Personal Computing business, which includes Windows plus search advertising revenue and sales of devices and games consoles, it delivered $13.37 billion in sales, up 6% from a year earlier, beating the Street’s target of $12.66 billion.\\nDevices and Windows license sales rose 3% from a year earlier, even though inventory levels remain elevated due to the current economic uncertainty, Nadella said on the call. Microsoft is planning to end support for the older Windows 10 operating system, which was launched in October 2015, at the end of October. So enterprises are now racing to switch to Windows 11, with deployments of that software increasing by 75% in the quarter.\\n“We continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end of support for Windows 10,” Nadella said.\\nHolger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said Microsoft is firing on all cyclinders, with all of its business units growing decently, even the “often lukewarm” Windows segment.\\n“The major concern is LinkedIn, where growth fell back into the single digits,” he said. “That’s surprising as talent acquisition remains central and important for enterprises. But overall, it was a good quarter, and Microsoft is on track to bring its operating income up to 50% of total revenue by the end of the current quarter.”\\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft provided an update on its close relationship with OpenAI, saying that it has the first right of refusal to cater to it anytime it needs more computing capacity. However, it may not always deliver that extra capacity, and if that happens, OpenAI will then be able to seek out other cloud partners.\\nDespite the after-hours jump, Microsoft’s stock is still down just over 6% in the year to date.\\nImage: Microsoft/livestream\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\\nJoin our community on YouTube\\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\\nTHANK YOU'}\n",

Its training process involved 16 billion tokens—about 8.3 billion of them unique—drawn from synthetic and curated web-based datasets.\\nA reinforcement learning (RL) phase, using only about 6,400 math-focused problems, further refined the model’s reasoning capabilities.\\nThe model has been released under a permissive MIT license — enabling its use for broad commercial and enterprise applications, and fine-tuning or distillation, without restriction — and is compatible with widely used inference frameworks including Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and Ollama.\\nMicrosoft provides detailed recommendations on inference parameters and system prompt formatting to help developers get the most from the model.\\nOutperforms larger models\\nThe model’s development reflects Microsoft’s growing emphasis on training smaller models capable of rivaling much larger systems in performance.\\nDespite its relatively modest size, Phi-4-reasoning-plus outperforms larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B on a number of demanding benchmarks.\\nOn the AIME 2025 math exam, for instance, it delivers a higher average accuracy at passing all 30 questions on the first try (a feat known as “pass@1”) than the 70B parameter distillation model, and approaches the performance of DeepSeek-R1 itself, which is far larger at 671B parameters.\\nStructured thinking via fine-tuning\\nTo achieve this, Microsoft employed a data-centric training strategy.\\nDuring the supervised fine-tuning stage, the model was trained using a curated blend of synthetic chain-of-thought reasoning traces and filtered high-quality prompts.\\nA key innovation in the training approach was the use of structured reasoning outputs marked with special <think>\\nand </think>\\ntokens.\\nThese guide the model to separate its intermediate reasoning steps from the final answer, promoting both transparency and coherence in long-form problem solving.\\nReinforcement learning for accuracy and depth\\nFollowing fine-tuning, Microsoft used outcome-based reinforcement learning—specifically, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm—to improve the model’s output accuracy and efficiency.\\nThe RL reward function was crafted to balance correctness with conciseness, penalize repetition, and enforce formatting consistency. This led to longer but more thoughtful responses, particularly on questions where the model initially lacked confidence.\\nOptimized for research and engineering constraints\\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus is intended for use in applications that benefit from high-quality reasoning under memory or latency constraints. It supports a context length of 32,000 tokens by default and has demonstrated stable performance in experiments with inputs up to 64,000 tokens.\\nIt is best used in a chat-like setting and performs optimally with a system prompt that explicitly instructs it to reason through problems step-by-step before presenting a solution.\\nExtensive safety testing and use guidelines\\nMicrosoft positions the model as a research tool and a component for generative AI systems rather than a drop-in solution for all downstream tasks.\\nDevelopers are advised to carefully evaluate performance, safety, and fairness before deploying the model in high-stakes or regulated environments.\\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus has undergone extensive safety evaluation, including red-teaming by Microsoft’s AI Red Team and benchmarking with tools like Toxigen to assess its responses across sensitive content categories.\\nAccording to Microsoft, this release demonstrates that with carefully curated data and training techniques, small models can deliver strong reasoning performance — and democratic, open access to boot.\\nHere’s a revised version of the enterprise implications section in a more technical, news-style tone, aligning with a business-technology publication:\\nImplications for enterprise technical decision-makers\\nThe release of Microsoft’s Phi-4-reasoning-plus may present meaningful opportunities for enterprise technical stakeholders managing AI model development, orchestration, or data infrastructure.\\nFor AI engineers and model lifecycle managers, the model’s 14B parameter size coupled with competitive benchmark performance introduces a viable option for high-performance reasoning without the infrastructure demands of significantly larger models. Its compatibility with frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and Ollama provides deployment flexibility across different enterprise stacks, including containerized and serverless environments.\\nTeams responsible for deploying and scaling machine learning models may find the model’s support for 32k-token contexts—expandable to 64k in testing—particularly useful in document-heavy use cases such as legal analysis, technical QA, or financial modeling. The built-in structure of separating chain-of-thought reasoning from the final answer could also simplify integration into interfaces where interpretability or auditability is required.\\nFor AI orchestration teams, Phi-4-reasoning-plus offers a model architecture that can be more easily slotted into pipelines with resource constraints. This is relevant in scenarios where real-time reasoning must occur under latency or cost limits. Its demonstrated ability to generalize to out-of-domain problems, including NP-hard tasks like 3SAT and TSP, suggests utility in algorithmic planning and decision support use cases beyond those explicitly targeted during training.\\nData engineering leads may also consider the model’s reasoning format—designed to reflect intermediate problem-solving steps—as a mechanism for tracking logical consistency across long sequences of structured data. The structured output format could be integrated into validation layers or logging systems to support explainability in data-rich applications.\\nFrom a governance and safety standpoint, Phi-4-reasoning-plus incorporates multiple layers of post-training safety alignment and has undergone adversarial testing by Microsoft’s internal AI Red Team. For organizations subject to compliance or audit requirements, this may reduce the overhead of developing custom alignment workflows from scratch.\\nOverall, Phi-4-reasoning-plus shows how the reasoning craze kicked off by the likes of OpenAI’s “o” series of models and DeepSeek R1 is continuing to accelerate and move downstream to smaller, more accessible, affordable, and customizable models.\\nFor technical decision-makers tasked with managing performance, scalability, cost, and risk, it offers a modular, interpretable alternative that can be evaluated and integrated on a flexible basis—whether in isolated inference endpoints, embedded tooling, or full-stack generative AI systems.'}\n",

The middle of the range was higher than LSEG’s $72.26 billion consensus. The company sees 34% to 35% in Azure growth at constant currency, compared with StreetAccount’s 31.5% consensus.\\nManagement reiterated that capital expenditures will grow in the new fiscal year, though at a slower rate than the current 2025 fiscal year. The company’s implied operating margin of 43.35% was just shy of StreetAccount’s 43.5% consensus.\\nRevenue increased 13% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement. Net income climbed 18% to $25.8 billion from $21.9 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.\\nWhile earnings and revenue topped estimates, those results are backward looking. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were announced in early April, so the company’s optimistic forecast provided some relief to investors who have been concerned about how tech businesses will fare the remainder of the year.\\nCEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on construction of data centers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads. That requires hefty imports from overseas, meaning costs could rise depending on where tariffs land.\\nMicrosoft continued to invest heavily in AI infrastructure during the quarter. Capital expenditures, excluding finance leases, reached $16.75 billion, up nearly 53%. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $16.37 billion.\\nThe company’s Azure revenue grew 33%, with 16 points of the growth associated with AI. Analysts polled by StreetAccount and CNBC had anticipated 30.3% and 29.7% growth, respectively.\\nIn January, Microsoft flagged disappointing non-AI Azure cloud execution with clients it engages alongside partners. Microsoft saw some improvement in these efforts during this quarter, said Amy Hood, Microsoft’s finance chief, on a conference call with analysts. “Things were a little better, and we still have some work to do in our scale motions and we’re encouraged by our progress,” she said.\\nMeanwhile, in AI, Microsoft brought infrastructure capacity online faster than expected, Hood said.\\n“Demand is growing a bit faster,” she said. “Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June.”\\nThe Intelligent Cloud unit that includes Azure produced $26.75 billion in revenue, up around 21% and more than StreetAccount’s consensus of $26.16 billion.\\nMicrosoft said more than 15 million people are now using its GitHub Copilot assistant, four times more than last year, Nadella said on Wednesday’s call.\\nRevenue in the Productivity and Business Processes segment, which contains Office software subscriptions and LinkedIn, rose 10% to $29.94 billion, beating the $29.57 billion StreetAccount consensus. LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions offering for recruiters “continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market,” Hood said.\\nIn the More Personal Computing unit, containing Windows, search advertising, devices and video game consoles, revenue rose 6% to $13.37 billion, higher than StreetAccount’s $12.66 billion consensus.\\nMicrosoft said sales of devices and of Windows operating licenses to device makers increased 3%, as inventory levels remained elevated because of tariff uncertainty. Technology industry researcher Gartner estimated that PC shipments went up 4.8% in the quarter.\\n“We continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end of support for Windows 10,” Nadella said. Support for the operating system introduced in 2015 will end in October. Deployments of the next-generation Windows 11 among commercial clients were up around 75%, he said.\\nDuring the quarter, which ended on March 31, Microsoft announced an adjustment to its relationship with key AI partner OpenAI. The company said it would have a right of first refusal when OpenAI wants new computing capacity, but won’t always have to deliver it. On the same day, OpenAI announced the Stargate AI infrastructure project alongside Oracle and SoftBank at the White House.\\nMicrosoft said it had $623 million in “other expense” during the quarter. The sum includes recognized losses on equity method investments, including OpenAI. The figure was $2.29 billion in the prior quarter.\\nAs of Wednesday’s close, Microsoft shares were down 7% for the year, while the S&P 500 index was down about 6%.\"}\n",

You don't want to be upside down when the shape of demand changes,” he added, especially given that training AI models needs different resources than inferencing workloads.\\nThe CEO said the combination of Moore’s Law, improvements in software design, and changes to model architecture, mean hyperscale AI operators need to change their plans.\\n“We just want to make sure we're accounting for the latest and greatest sort of information we have on all of that,” Nadella said. “And that's what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace [of datacenter and AI buildout].”\\nCFO Amy Hood weighed in an observation that Microsoft’s getting better at provisioning AI datacenters and is sometimes making capacity available earlier than planned.\\nShe also told investors “margins on the AI side of the business are better than they were at this point by far than when we went through the … server to cloud transition.”\\nThat shift also saw Microsoft spend up big to build Azure and has worked out just fine as revenue for “Azure and other cloud services” grew 33 percent year over year.

Our latest research paper shows that the Waymo Driver is making significant strides in both areas. By reducing the most dangerous crashes and providing better protection for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, Waymo is making streets safer in cities where it operates.\\nThe paper, accepted to be published in the Traffic Injury Prevention Journal, expands on our Safety Impact Hub research, providing a deeper analysis of Waymo’s performance across 11 different crash types compared to human drivers. It also offers new insights into Waymo’s positive impact on serious injury crash rates.\\nThe research finds that, compared to human benchmarks over 56.7 million miles and regardless of who was at fault, the Waymo Driver had:\\nSafer interactions with vulnerable road users (VRUs) with substantial reductions in crashes involving injuries among pedestrians (92% reduction), cyclists (82% reduction), and motorcyclists (82% reduction).\\n96% fewer injury-involving intersection crashes, which, according to NHTSA, are a leading cause of severe road harm for human drivers. This reduction can be largely attributed to the Waymo Driver’s ability to detect and appropriately respond to vehicles running a red light.\\n85% fewer crashes with suspected serious or worse injuries. Building on our previous research, which demonstrated Waymo’s significant reductions across all injuries combined, the new study provides early evidence for similar benefits in serious injuries alone. The results are statistically significant but because serious injury cases are, fortunately, rare, they’re based on a small number of events. We will continue to monitor outcomes and gain greater confidence as we accumulate more miles.\\nThese findings add to the growing body of data that the Waymo Driver is reducing the most dangerous crash types, contributing to safer roadways, and pushing forward a vision of zero traffic deaths and serious injuries on our roads. While this particular research did not account for crash contribution, a previous study led by the insurance company Swiss Re demonstrated that the Waymo Driver’s positive impact is even more significant when contribution is taken into account.\\n“It’s exciting to see the real positive impact that Waymo is making on the streets of America as we continue to expand,” said Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Chief Safety Officer. “This research reinforces the growing evidence that the Waymo Driver is playing a crucial role in reducing serious crashes and protecting all road users.”\\n“It’s encouraging to see real-world data showing Waymo outperforming human drivers when it comes to safety. Fewer crashes and fewer injuries — especially for people walking and biking — is exactly the kind of progress we want to see from autonomous vehicles,” — said Jonathan Adkins, Chief Executive Officer at Governors Highway Safety Association.\\nAs Waymo increases in scale, we look forward to strengthening our safety data, assessing the long-term impact on road safety, and helping to advance conversations amongst researchers, policymakers, and safety groups.\\nWe look forward to continuing this conversation and working toward a future where serious traffic injuries, one of the biggest causes of death in the U.S, are dramatically reduced. For those interested in a deeper dive into the data and methodology, we encourage you to explore the full study, and our rolling safety data hub.'}\n",

Traditional academic benchmarks only tell you so much, which has led many to lean on vibes-based analysis from LM Arena. However, a new study claims this popular AI ranking platform is rife with unfair practices, favoring large companies that just so happen to rank near the top of the index. The site\\'s operators, however, say the study draws the wrong conclusions.\\nLM Arena was created in 2023 as a research project at the University of California, Berkeley. The pitch is simple—users feed a prompt into two unidentified AI models in the \"Chatbot Arena\" and evaluate the outputs to vote on the one they like more. This data is aggregated in the LM Arena leaderboard that shows which models people like the most, which can help track improvements in AI models.\\nCompanies are paying more attention to this ranking as the AI market heats up. Google noted when it released Gemini 2.5 Pro that the model debuted at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, where it remains to this day. Meanwhile, DeepSeek\\'s strong performance in the Chatbot Arena earlier this year helped to catapult it to the upper echelons of the LLM race.\\nThe researchers, hailing from Cohere Labs, Princeton, and MIT, believe AI developers may have placed too much stock in LM Arena. The new study, available on the preprint arXiv server, claims the arena rankings are distorted by practices that make it easier for proprietary chatbots to outperform open ones. The authors say LM Arena allows developers of proprietary large language models (LLMs) to test multiple versions of their AI on the platform. However, only the highest performing one is added to the public leaderboard.\\nSome AI developers are taking extreme advantage of the private testing option. The study reports that Meta tested a whopping 27 private variants of Llama-4 before release. Google is also a beneficiary of LM Arena\\'s private testing system, having tested 10 variants of Gemini and Gemma between January and March 2025.'}\n",

These limits, known as the “Diffusion Rule,” are designed to place export controls on advanced AI chips and model weights to prevent countries like China from advancing in the AI race.\\n“To enhance U.S. national security and economic strength, it is essential that we do not offshore this critical technology and that the world’s AI runs on American rails,” the Biden administration said at the time. “It is important to work with AI companies and foreign governments to put in place critical security and trust standards as they build out their AI ecosystems.”\\nPresident Donald Trump, the CNBC report added, is working on revising these restrictions, bringing additional uncertainty to an already contentious rule.\\nA group of Senate Republicans last month wrote to the White House asking Trump to rescind his predecessor’s rule, saying it could hinder domestic innovation and disrupt existing international partnerships.\\n”Every day this rule remains in place, American companies face mounting uncertainty, stalled investments, and the risk of losing critical global partnerships that cannot be easily regained,” the group’s letter said.\\nAnthropic wants the government to impose greater restrictions on imports, something that could curb Nvidia’s revenue.\\n“China, with half of the world’s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack.

The awkwardly named Nvidia AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI is available to download today for computers equipped with an Nvidia RTX 4080 GPU or higher, and works by bridging Blender’s 3D modelling software with Black Forest Lab’s FLUX.1 image generator.\\nNvidia’s new tool can turn 3D scenes into AI images\\nNvidia’s ‘AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI’ combines Blender with a text-to-image generator.\\nNvidia’s ‘AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI’ combines Blender with a text-to-image generator.\\nUsers can draft a scene in Blender using 3D objects like buildings, plants, animals, and vehicles, which is then used as a reference to create a 2D image. The idea is that manually adjusting the viewing position or where certain objects should be placed will provide more control over finer details when generating 2D images compared to using text descriptions alone.\\nFor example, if you have a very specific image of a city in your mind — the shape and height of the buildings, how many trees or cars are displayed, and even the angle you’re viewing it at — you can use Nvidia’s workflow to manually create a rough version of that in Blender. The FLUX.1 image generator will then use that as a base for the images it creates, which could be less frustrating than repeatedly tweaking text-based descriptions until you get something vaguely similar to what you wanted. The 3D objects plotted out in Blender don’t even need to be highly detailed, as the tool is only using them as a layout guide.\\nNvidia describes its blueprints as “pre-defined, customizable AI workflows” that are designed to help developers build generative AI apps. In this case, Nvidia says its AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI provides step-by-step documentation, sample assets, and a preconfigured environment to guide users through using the tool.\\nThe workflow isn’t entirely unique — Adobe teased a similar tool during its MAX event in October called “Project Concept” that also lets users map out 3D scenes that can be used to direct image generation. Adobe’s variant is still in its experimental stages, however, and may never be released to the wider public.\\nMost Popular\\n- Amazon has no choice but to display tariffs on prices now\\n- Mark Zuckerberg just declared war on the entire advertising industry\\n- A judge just blew up Apple’s control of the App Store\\n- Google’s Play Store lost nearly half its apps\\n- Microsoft is raising prices on Xbox consoles, controllers, and games worldwide'}\n",

Learn More\\nOpenAI has rolled back a recent update to its GPT-4o model used as the default in ChatGPT after widespread reports that the system had become excessively flattering and overly agreeable, even supporting outright delusions and destructive ideas.\\nThe rollback comes amid internal acknowledgments from OpenAI engineers and increasing concern among AI experts, former executives, and users over the risk of what many are now calling “AI sycophancy.”\\nIn a statement published on its website late last night, April 29, 2025, OpenAI said the latest GPT-4o update was intended to enhance the model’s default personality to make it more intuitive and effective across varied use cases.\\nHowever, the update had an unintended side effect: ChatGPT began offering uncritical praise for virtually any user idea, no matter how impractical, inappropriate, or even harmful.\\nAs the company explained, the model had been optimized using user feedback—thumbs-up and thumbs-down signals—but the development team placed too much emphasis on short-term indicators.\\nOpenAI now acknowledges that it didn’t fully account for how user interactions and needs evolve over time, resulting in a chatbot that leaned too far into affirmation without discernment.\\nExamples sparked concern\\nOn platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter), users began posting screenshots that illustrated the issue.\\nIn one widely circulated Reddit post, a user recounted how ChatGPT described a gag business idea—selling “literal ‘shit on a stick’”—as genius and suggested investing $30,000 into the venture. The AI praised the idea as “performance art disguised as a gag gift” and “viral gold,” highlighting just how uncritically it was willing to validate even absurd pitches.\\nOther examples were more troubling. In one instance cited by VentureBeat, a user pretending to espouse paranoid delusions received reinforcement from GPT-4o, which praised their supposed clarity and self-trust.\\nAnother account showed the model offering what a user described as an “open endorsement” of terrorism-related ideas.\\nCriticism mounted rapidly. Former OpenAI interim CEO Emmett Shear warned that tuning models to be people pleasers can result in dangerous behavior, especially when honesty is sacrificed for likability. Hugging Face CEO Clement Delangue reposted concerns about psychological manipulation risks posed by AI that reflexively agrees with users, regardless of context.\\nOpenAI’s response and mitigation measures\\nOpenAI has taken swift action by rolling back the update and restoring an earlier GPT-4o version known for more balanced behavior. In the accompanying announcement, the company detailed a multi-pronged approach to correcting course. This includes:\\n- Refining training and prompt strategies to explicitly reduce sycophantic tendencies.\\n- Reinforcing model alignment with OpenAI’s Model Spec, particularly around transparency and honesty.\\n- Expanding pre-deployment testing and direct user feedback mechanisms.\\n- Introducing more granular personalization features, including the ability to adjust personality traits in real-time and select from multiple default personas.\\nOpenAI technical staffer Will Depue posted on X highlighting the central issue: the model was trained using short-term user feedback as a guidepost, which inadvertently steered the chatbot toward flattery.\\nOpenAI now plans to shift toward feedback mechanisms that prioritize long-term user satisfaction and trust.\\nHowever, some users have reacted with skepticism and dismay to OpenAI’s lessons learned and proposed fixes going forward.\\n“Please take more responsibility for your influence over millions of real people,” wrote artist @nearcyan on X.\\nHarlan Stewart, communications generalist at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, California, posted on X a larger term concern about AI sycophancy even if this particular OpenAI model has been fixed: “The talk about sycophancy this week is not because of GPT-4o being a sycophant. It’s because of GPT-4o being really, really bad at being a sycophant. AI is not yet capable of skillful, harder-to-detect sycophancy, but it will be someday soon.”\\nA broader warning sign for the AI industry\\nThe GPT-4o episode has reignited broader debates across the AI industry about how personality tuning, reinforcement learning, and engagement metrics can lead to unintended behavioral drift.\\nCritics compared the model’s recent behavior to social media algorithms that, in pursuit of engagement, optimize for addiction and validation over accuracy and health.\\nShear underscored this risk in his commentary, noting that AI models tuned for praise become “suck-ups,” incapable of disagreeing even when the user would benefit from a more honest perspective.\\nHe further warned that this issue isn’t unique to OpenAI, pointing out that the same dynamic applies to other large model providers, including Microsoft’s Copilot.\\nImplications for the enterprise\\nFor enterprise leaders adopting conversational AI, the sycophancy incident serves as a clear signal: model behavior is as critical as model accuracy.\\nA chatbot that flatters employees or validates flawed reasoning can pose serious risks—from poor business decisions and misaligned code to compliance issues and insider threats.\\nIndustry analysts now advise enterprises to demand more transparency from vendors about how personality tuning is conducted, how often it changes, and whether it can be reversed or controlled at a granular level.\\nProcurement contracts should include provisions for auditing, behavioral testing, and real-time control of system prompts. Data scientists are encouraged to monitor not just latency and hallucination rates but also metrics like “agreeableness drift.”\\nMany organizations may also begin shifting toward open-source alternatives that they can host and tune themselves. By owning the model weights and the reinforcement learning process, companies can retain full control over how their AI systems behave—eliminating the risk of a vendor-pushed update turning a critical tool into a digital yes-man overnight.\\nWhere does AI alignment go from here? What can enterprises learn and act on from this incident?\\nOpenAI says it remains committed to building AI systems that are useful, respectful, and aligned with diverse user values—but acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all personality cannot meet the needs of 500 million weekly users.\\nThe company hopes that greater personalization options and more democratic feedback collection will help tailor ChatGPT’s behavior more effectively in the future. CEO Sam Altman has also previously stated the company plans to — in the coming weeks and months — release a state-of-the-art open source large language model (LLM) to compete with the likes of Meta’s Llama series, Mistral, Cohere, DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen team.\\nThis would also allow users concerned about a model provider company such as OpenAI updating its cloud-hosted models in unwanted ways or that have deleterious impacts on end-users to deploy their own variants of the model locally or in their cloud infrastructure, and fine-tune them or preserve them with the desired traits and qualities, especially for business use cases.\\nSimilarly, for those enterprise and individual AI users concerned about their models’ sycophancy, already a new benchmark test to gauge this quality across different models has been created by developer Tim Duffy. It’s called “syco-bench” and is available here.\\nIn the meantime, the sycophancy backlash offers a cautionary tale for the entire AI industry: user trust is not built by affirmation alone. Sometimes, the most helpful answer is a thoughtful “no.”\\nMore information revealed in OpenAI’s Reddit AMA\\nIn a Reddit AMA held just hours after the rollback, Joanne Jang, Head of Model Behavior at OpenAI, offered a rare window into the internal thinking behind ChatGPT’s design and the challenges her team faces in tuning large models for personality and trust.\\nJang confirmed that the recent sycophantic behavior wasn’t intentional, but rather a result of how subtle shifts in training and reinforcement can spiral into outsized effects.\\nShe explained that behavior like excessive praise or flattery can emerge from attempts to improve usability—especially if the team overweights short-term feedback such as thumbs-up responses. Jang acknowledged this as a mistake.\\n“We didn’t bake in enough nuance,” she said, noting that early efforts to reduce hallucinations led to models that compulsively hedged, undermining clarity.\\nShe added that while system prompts—those behind-the-scenes instructions that guide a model’s behavior—can shape tone and policy adherence, they’re ultimately too blunt a tool to reliably steer nuanced behavior like disagreeing gracefully.\\nInstead, OpenAI is leaning more heavily on changes made during model training itself to hardwire behavior like honesty, critical thinking, and tactful disagreement.\\nOne of the core themes of the AMA was the difficulty of striking a balance between helpfulness and honesty. Jang said she hopes to eventually enable every user to mold ChatGPT into a personality that suits them—including personas that offer critical feedback and push back on poor ideas. But until that vision is realized, the company is working toward a more palatable default: something broadly accessible yet capable of evolving through personalization.\\nJang also acknowledged internal debate over how much personality is too much. Some users, she said, appreciated the outgoing, emoji-rich personality of the recent GPT-4o variant, seeing it as creative and even inspiring—particularly in use cases like brainstorming and design. But others found it off-putting or even cringeworthy. Rather than enforce a single tone, Jang suggested OpenAI will likely introduce a set of personality presets that users can choose from and adjust in real time, without needing to dive into custom instructions or system prompt editing.\\nOn the specific issue of sycophancy, she reiterated that OpenAI is building new metrics to measure it with more granularity and objectivity. Not all compliments are equal, she noted—and future models will need to distinguish between affirming support and uncritical agreement.\\n“Not everyone wants a chatbot that agrees with them,” Jang said. “But they do want one that understands them.”'}\n",

Providing a global measurement of the competencies to engage with AI, the test is planned to run in 2029 with results expected at the end of 2031. The time line may be long, but as with all OECD assessments the issue is how education systems leaders and educators might respond to it in advance.\\nFramed as part of the 2029 PISA exercise,\\nThe PISA 2029 Media & Artificial Intelligence Literacy (MAIL) assessment will shed light on whether young students have had opportunities to learn and to engage proactively and critically in a world where production, participation, and social networking are increasingly mediated by digital and AI tools.\\nAI literacy is a currently hot topic. For many commentators, it is “the” major imperative for education. Multiple definitions and frameworks circulate routinely on social media. Given the OECD’s enduring influence through educational testing, its AI literacy intervention could, then, be consequential in setting the international standard in relation to students’ competencies to engage with AI.\\nWhat the OECD test will accomplish is to provide a concrete global definition of AI literacy, subject it to quantitative and comparative measurement, and encourage educators and students to “perform” to the test. This post is an attempt to work through how the OECD AI literacy test will function, and its potential implications.\\nDefinition\\nThe first stage of setting up a test of any competency is providing a clear definition of what is to be tested. The OECD offers its current definition of Media & AI Literacy as “the set of competencies to interact with digital content and platforms effectively, ethically and responsibly.”\\nIt elaborates that “it is essential to assess and develop the competencies students need to understand how digital and AI tools work, the human role in digital tools and media, the social and ethical consequences of using digital and AI tools, how to communicate and collaborate effectively with digital and AI tools, and how to critically evaluate the media content.”\\nBy mixing media literacy and AI literacy, the OECD has set itself a significant challenge. There is a very long history of efforts to conceptualize various forms of media, digital, data and AI literacies, and all of them involve some power struggles over definition.\\nMedia educators, for example, have long sought to position media literacy in terms of the “3Cs” of consumption, creation, and critique. Educators focused on “digital literacy” have similarly advocated for students becoming critically informed about digital technologies, vendors and discourses rather than passive consumers and content creators alone.\\nPrecisely what kinds of literacies are taught to young people is always a political matter, helping to define how students are oriented as readers and writers, or consumers and producers, in their own social and technical contexts. This raises the risk of excluding certain kinds of literacy.\\nJames O’Sullivan recently argued, provocatively and compellingly, the case for “AI illiteracy,” noting that most discussion frames AI literacy “as a form of compliance: one learns the tools so as not to fall behind”:\\nThere is, of course, a place for AI literacy—particularly where it enables informed critique, ethical resistance, or meaningful co-creation. But we must be cautious of treating it as a universal good. There is a difference between understanding enough to critique and absorbing so much technical detail that one begins to mistake function for truth. The illusion of understanding—the belief that being able to prompt a chatbot effectively constitutes deep knowledge—may be more dangerous than ignorance.\\nThe provocative notion of AI illiteracy therefore foregrounds the politics of calling for universal AI literacy standards and the kinds of exclusions in terms of knowledge, learning and skills that most definitions impose.\\nThe OECD is no neutral actor when it comes to AI—it has for several years promoted the use of AI in education and regularly produces epochal statements about its transformative effects. Much of its emphasis is on AI effects on the economy, and thus on maintaining productivity and economic progress through technological upskilling. It is now, through the AI literacy test, exerting its political authority over how AI skills are to be defined and valued.\\nIts aim is to produce a globally standardized definition of AI literacy that is likely to erase nuance and diversity in approaches to thinking about young people’s engagement with this family of controversial technologies and their contested effects. How much of the criticality of media literacy remains, once the OECD has defined it in terms of “evaluation” skills, remains to be seen, though you could imagine it being reduced to whether a user checks the accuracy of a prompt response.\\nBeyond the political decisions it will have to make about defining AI literacy, and what to include or exclude from the test, the OECD also faces a technical and methodological challenge: how to operationalize it as a series of test items that can be measured.\\nQuantification\\nAvailable documentation indicates that the OECD’s test developers are currently working on instruments for the test. The OECD has long positioned itself as a source of metrological expertise and innovation.\\nThis means it is now translating AI literacy into a testable elements that can generate quantitative and comparable results. How exactly the test will appear, what data it will generate, and how it will be analyzed, remains as yet unclear.\\nAn illuminating case is the OECD’s earlier test of social and emotional skills, which involved the production of a condensed psychometric scheme for the enumeration of student emotions. What this meant was that the OECD conducted a large review of available psychometric instruments, before finally settling on an adapted version of the “Big 5” personality characteristics model.\\nIn the process it erased other competing models for the measurement of social and emotional learning, imposing a global framework by which such skills or qualities may be measured and compared internationally. In the process, it has produced a distinctive way of understanding “emotion” as an educational issue.\\nThe model for assessing AI literacy is likely to follow a similar path. It will require AI literacy to be broken down into a series of measurable units which can feature as testable items. In fact, the OECD has already begun quantifying the capacities of AI itself in order to enact comparisons with human skills, as the basis for highlighting the necessary competencies for education systems to teach.\\nIn the description of the AI literacy assessment, the OECD claims it is exploring assessment innovations to capture these human capacities:\\nThis new assessment is envisioned as a simulated environment that would allow the collection of evidence for multiple competencies of the literacy model. These competencies are assessed using a variety of functional tools that are accessible to students in a realistic way throughout the assessment (e.g., realistic simulations of the internet, social media, and generative AI tools).\\nAs such, the assessment is not expected to be a conventional test, but organized as simulations making use of accessible existing “tools.” It will mobilise such tools to test a specifically defined “model” of AI literacy and its componentized “competencies.”\\nThe eventual output of the assessment, in common with all OECD tests, must be numbers enabling the evaluation and comparison of programs, systems and countries.\\nAI literacy must become AI literacy-as-numbers, subject to techniques of metrology and amenable to comparison.\\nIt’s not hard to imagine there being eventual winners in the AI literacy rankings. This is likely to encourage policy officials, especially in the US, China and Europe, to compete for position on the ordinal AI literacy scale. And it is such numbers, of course, that the OECD can mobilize to identify best practices for others to emulate.\\nPerformativity\\nAs with all OECD tests, the significance of the AI literacy assessment is not necessarily the quantitative results it will produce in more than half a decade’s time. It’s the activity that it incites in education systems in anticipation of the assessment. The existence of a test animates significant efforts to prepare students to take it. In this case that effort would serve the OECD’s overarching vision of AI as a transformative social and economic force requiring the participation of an AI literate population.\\nIndeed, the OECD is not only producing an AI literacy test, but collaborating with the European Commission on an “AI Literacy Framework” to be launched for consultation at the end of May 2025. The framework will consist of “the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will adequately prepare students in primary and secondary education”:\\nThe initiative will also provide the foundation for the first assessment of AI Literacy in the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and support the EU’s goals to promote quality and inclusive digital education and skills. At its heart is the integration of AI literacy across school subjects. This includes teaching students to use AI tools as well as how to co-create with them and reflect on responsible and ethical use.\\nAs well as offering the “foundation” for the test, this framework appears to normalize the idea of integrating AI into schooling itself. For AI literacy to the tested, it must not only be taught, but become part of the normal routines of teaching and learning. The incorporation of AI into schooling is highly contested, with at least one key argument (among many others) being that it serves the market-making interests of technology and edtech businesses who see lucrative opportunities in introducing AI into schools.\\nBesides the OECD and the EC, another partner is code.org, the organization that has promoted “learning to code” internationally and was recently a major cheerleader of the US Executive Order “mandating” the use of AI, and the promotion of AI literacy, in American education. Audrey Watters argues that the kind of AI literacy promoted by the order serves governmental and commercial interests, but is likely to lack any criticality due to the US administration’s hostility to ideas about bias and discrimination.\\nMore prosaically, the involvement of code.org as an industry-centric organization suggests the AI literacy framework may focus centrally on skills of AI use (“learning to prompt” as the new “learning to code”) than any critical engagement with AI as a social and public problem.\\nIn its most attenuated form, AI literacy can appear as a kind of technical training in efficient AI use—what I’ve elsewhere called “pedagoGPT” courses and classes. For some, educating students with AI literacy is even primarily a geopolitical and economic matter, as nations compete for talent and dominance in a new “space race.”\\nLuci Pangrazio has argued that similar kinds of “digital literacy” programs sponsored by technology companies now function as a form of governance in schools:\\nIf digital literacy is defined and developed in relation to the different platforms and apps in schools, and if the platforms and apps in schools are increasingly designed to monitor and surveil (control) staff and students because that is how learning is evidenced, then digital literacy has become a powerful way of governing both teachers and students in schools.\\nIn other words, the commercial co-optation of “digital literacy” has already led to it becoming a kind of technical training that habituates and accustoms students and teachers to using the technology, which also exerts influence over their practice. Extrapolating from this case, we can see how the OECD’s AI literacy test and the associated framework might exert a kind of governing pressure on schools, educators and students to act accordingly.\\nIt is the use of a test to incite anticipatory actions that is often referred to as “performativity.” In this context, performativity refers specifically to the ways that measurements, such as those produced by a test, compel education leaders and teachers to “teach to the test” in order to perform well in the measurement exercise.\\nThe OECD PISA test is well known as an engine of performativity, inciting policymakers and system leaders to act to improve “performance” in order to rank highly in the results. PISA tests enable the statistical governance of education by compelling people to perform in reaction to the ranking.\\nAs part of PISA 2029, AI literacy thus appears as if it will become part of international educational ranking through international standardized testing. Educators and leaders may feel compelled to act on the OECD/EC/code.org framework in order to perform effectively on the test. This will harden the definition of AI literacy designated by the OECD, making AI skills and competencies into globally standardized and comparative indicators. AI literacy-as-numbers could make acting on AI a central preoccupation of schooling systems.\\nInfrastructuring AI literacy\\nWhile this is necessarily a little speculative, it’s important to recall the influence of the OECD on education systems worldwide. Its testing infrastructures enable the production of quantitative data at large scale, and drive educational decision-making and policy agendas. It’s worth remaining attentive to these ongoing political efforts to integrate AI literacy into schools, and the testing infrastructure the OECD is creating to enumerate students’ AI skills and competencies.\\nThe OECD’s efforts should be understood as an attempt at infrastructuring AI literacy. Infrastructuring AI literacy means building, maintaining and enacting a testing and measurement system that will not only enumerate AI competencies, but make AI literacy into a central concern and objective of schooling systems.\\nIt would function as an infrastructure of measurement that requires educators’ and students’ participation to construct international standardized data about AI literacy. They would have to perform to the measurement standards embedded in the infrastructure, following the prescriptions of the AI literacy framework, in order to “count.”\\nTracing the development and evolution of the AI literacy assessment much more fully will help illuminate how AI is being conceived as an educational concern, how it is being worked into metrological systems, and how a measurement exercise that remains several years in the future may incite anticipatory actions in education settings. How will educators and students be enrolled into this OECD infrastructure of AI literacy measurement, and perform AI literacy in advance of the assessment?'}\n",

The company is launching new features that will automatically label images that are detected to be made or edited using generative AI, and allow users to see fewer of them when browsing for similar topics.\\nPinterest is finally doing something about its AI infestation\\nAI labels are coming to a platform that sorely needed them.\\nAI labels are coming to a platform that sorely needed them.\\n“As people encounter AI-generated content on Pinterest, we are empowering our users to make more informed choices about the content they see”, said Matt Madrigal, Chief Technology Officer. “Gen AI content on Pinterest should enhance users’ ability to discover and act on their inspiration, and we are intentionally approaching this new landscape in a thoughtful way that benefits everyone on Pinterest.”\\nPinterest’s new Gen AI labels feature is rolling out globally, and should help prevent users from being duped. The labels will appear as an “AI modified” stamp in the bottom left-hand corner when a pin is clicked on in close-up. Pinterest identifies if an image was made or edited with AI by analyzing its metadata — presumably for invisible markers like Google’s SynthID or Adobe’s Content Credentials.\\nPinterest also says it’s developed “classifiers that automatically detect gen AI content” even if the image doesn’t carry metadata markers. Detection-based AI flaggers can be hit or miss, but Pinterest is allowing users to appeal if they believe their pins have been mislabelled.\\nTo say I’m thrilled would be an understatement. Pinterest has attracted widespread criticism from users about AI images dominating its platform, making it difficult to use the moodboard-maker for anything practical beyond just assembling images purely for aesthetic purposes.\\nArtists struggle to find accurate real-world reference materials, for example, and there’s a good chance the clothing, accessory, or furniture products appearing in pins can’t be purchased, because they don’t actually exist. Even as a provider of “inspiration,” that can be problematic, because everything from hairstyles to interior design concepts generated by AI — which can be deceptively realistic — may be impossible to achieve in real life.\\nAn experimental feature will also be launched “soon” that will allow Pinterest users to filter out some AI images for certain categories that are “prone to AI modification or generation,” according to Pinterest, such as beauty and art. The “see fewer” option will be available in the three-dot menu at the bottom right of a pin. Pinterest says this will flag its systems to recommend less of that content and will eventually expand to more pin categories, but it’s unclear just how much AI the feature will filter out. I can only hope it will eventually include an “all of it” option.'}\n",

The San Francisco-based startup has announced a $50 million Series B raise co-led by Arena Holdings and billionaire Mitchell Rales, co-founder of Danaher Corporation, with participation from Notable Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, TQ Ventures and Susa/Kivu Ventures, to automate the repetitive, bloated administrative workflows that cost healthcare providers millions every year and fuel rampant provider burnout. “This is a trillion-dollar market with significant white space, and Plenful has built a compelling wedge,” explains Chelcie Taylor of Notable Capital. “That’s why we were excited to invest.”\\nWith AI at its core, Plenful is positioning itself as the \"behind-the-scenes fix\" for a healthcare system struggling under the weight of outdated processes. And the startup has rapidly gained traction, onboarding 60 healthcare institutions to date — including Cencora, Renown Health, MUSC, and Tampa General — and is sustaining strong momentum with 4x year-over-year revenue growth.\\nTo get a deeper understanding of the actual day-to-day problems Plenful is addressing, I spoke with Founder & CEO, Joy Liu. Prior to founding Plenful in 2022, Liu worked as Director of Strategic Operations at Shields Health Solutions, a specialty pharmacy, where she was able to see first-hand the “sheer volume of work” that staff have to manage. “It was eye popping…and that workflow burden definitely shows up for the patient,” she explained. By leveraging automation, “we are freeing up staff who can now focus more on patients,” and support a greater patient load.\\nThe reality is that physicians spend nearly twice as much time on paperwork as they do on direct patient care. Furthermore, nurses spend up to 25% of their shift on documentation tasks (non-clinical work), while pharmacists spend 30% of their time verifying prescriptions versus other duties like patient education and counseling.\\nTo help ease this workload, Plenful focuses on various workflows that consume valuable staff time, such as prior authorization and compliance with the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Here’s a closer look at each.\\nPrior Authorization Workflows\\nIf you are not a medical professional, chances are you may not be familiar with the mechanics of how this antiquated system works, but prior authorization (PA) is a complex set of requirements that US healthcare providers must satisfy to get medical care and medications approved by health insurers – payers.\\nThe PA submission and review process often involves providers scrambling to gather patient-specific medical information including a summary of the patient’s condition and treatment history. The submissions are typically manual, with phone calls, or faxed paperwork going back and forth between providers and insurers. And during the PA review period, a patient’s medical care is often delayed - for days or even weeks, if the treatment, test, or medication requires PA before insurance will pay for it.\\nDr. Elizabeth Ofili, a practicing cardiologist and founder of Health 360x, a platform supporting healthcare institutions with clinical research, shared that: “in one case, after many hours of my time and staff time, we were unable to convince the health plan that a 55 year old man, with significant risks for heart disease should receive a recommended heart catheterization. After many visits to see me with complaints of chest pains and an inconclusive nuclear scan, he was eventually approved for the test, which showed severe heart blockage in his main artery – and this type of blockage is actually called the ‘widow maker’ because it can lead to sudden death.” Indeed, 29% of physicians report that PA has led to a serious adverse event for a patient in their care, according to the 2024 American Medical Association (AMA) Prior Authorization Survey.\\nBeyond the potentially catastrophic consequences for patient care and wellbeing, the PA process places an immense amount of financial strain on healthcare institutions and, by extension, patients. According to a 2023 CAQH Report, the cost of manual prior authorization administration for providers is $1.05 billion annually. In addition, when medical care is provided before a PA is approved, which is sometimes necessary in urgent or ambiguous cases, providers are often forced to absorb the full cost if the claim is later denied, which can lead to thousands of dollars per patient — which are subsequently passed on to patients in the form of unexpected medical bills.\\nPlenful’s belief is that in many instances, the health information necessary to satisfy PA is available though perhaps not easily accessible. And so the platform is designed to find and extract required information from various sources of medical records.\\nLiu explained: “There’s so much disparate data that exists in all these organizations. Whether it’s a fax, a messy Excel spreadsheet or pulling from one of their existing electronic medical records or other systems, we’ve built a very robust machine learning stack to wrangle those data sources.” After submission, the platform assists with tracking the status of each PA request and flagging any follow-up actions needed from providers in a dashboard interface.\\n340B Drug Pricing Program Compliance\\nNow another key use case for Plenful is 340B compliance. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is big business in healthcare — to the tune of $54 billion, and is actually quite complex. Launched in 1992, as a safety net program to help support cash-strapped healthcare institutions serving medicaid patients (termed, “covered entities”), the 340B program allows for price arbitrage – where healthcare institutions buy prescription drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers at a discounted price and get reimbursed by insurance companies, or payers at the market price – and the savings goes to support lower-cost medication and medical care for low-income and uninsured patients, in theory. It’s the “Robin hood principle” in action.\\nThe eligibility criteria has evolved since the program’s inception due to both policy changes and industry consolidation, and so too the number of participating institutions. For example, in 2010 the Affordable Care Act added Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Referral Centers, Sole Community Hospitals, and Free-Standing Cancer Hospitals to the program. Around the same time the agency that administers the 340B program – the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) expanded coverage to the outpatient clinics and pharmacies attached to existing hospitals; in addition, covered entities were permitted to contract with multiple retail pharmacies to dispense 340B drugs, further extending the universe of 340B participants. While there were fewer than 1,000 covered entities in 1994 — mostly public hospitals, community health centers, and clinics receiving federal funding, today there are over 50,000 covered entities eligible for the 340B program.\\nWith billions of dollars of discounted drugs flowing to healthcare institutions, alarm bells have been ringing, especially from drug manufacturers, about a lack of transparency and accountability in the administration of the program, and a misallocation of the cost savings away from the intended recipients - lower income patients. On the other hand, healthcare institutions insist that the intent of the program is being honored, with 340B savings being reinvested in community health services, free clinics, charity care, uncompensated care, and patient access initiatives. Some healthcare executives admit the program has veered from its original intent, but assert that healthcare organizations operate at “razor thin margins”, struggling to make ends meet due to being underpaid for services by payers, and “340B savings fills the gap”. In either case, the pressure placed upon healthcare institutions to tighten up their 340B programs has increased, in line with the enhanced scrutiny of the program.\\nEnter Plenful, which performs compliance audits to ensure adherence to the HRSA rules and manufacturer terms, checking for things such as site eligibility and unlawful duplicate discounts (receiving a 340B discount and then submitting a Medicaid claim for the same drug). At the same time, the platform is able to review prescriptions or treatments that were originally assumed ineligible for 340B discounts — and uncover hidden savings by identifying eligible claims that manual processes might have missed. As a point of clarification, although institutions purchase drugs at a 340B discount, they often determine after the fact which prescriptions meet the full eligibility criteria based on data pulled across different systems – EHRs, pharmacy dispensing systems and medical billing platforms. Liu shared that in one instance, “after two months of working with a system, we identified $1.2 million of additional 340B savings. It was really exciting to see that kind of output.”\\nAddressing the controversy around 340B, Liu noted that given the macro environment and increased scrutiny from both manufacturers and payer groups, the operational complexity and burdens have just increased on healthcare providers, so having a platform like Plenful which offers more transparency has really resonated. “We’re all about transparency and data harmony.”\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe fact that healthcare in America is a broken system is an often cited but less understood reality. Beneath the surface of every delayed treatment and rising hospital bill lies a maze of outdated, manual back office processes and workflows that drain both financial and human resources. Plenful is not trying to reinvent clinical care — it\\'s aiming to modernize the infrastructure beneath it. By automating some of the most time-consuming and error-prone workflows, from prior authorizations to 340B compliance, the company is unlocking real savings for institutions and giving frontline staff something increasingly scarce: time to focus on patients.\\nDISCLOSURE: Shimite Obialo is a consultant working with Dr. Elizabeth Ofili’s company Accuhealth Technologies, Inc., which operates the Health 360x platform.'}\n",

Good to see you.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nYou too. Last time you were here, you had launched Llama 3. Now you\\'ve launched Llama 4.\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nWell, the first version.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nThat\\'s right. What\\'s new? What\\'s exciting? What\\'s changed?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nThe whole field is so dynamic. I feel like a ton has changed since the last time we talked. Meta AI has almost a billion people using it monthly now, which is pretty wild. I think this is going to be a really big year for all of this, especially once you get the personalization loop going, which we’re just starting to build in now really, from both the context that all the algorithms have about what you’re interested in — feed, your profile information, your social graph information — but also what you\\'re interacting with the AI about. That’s going to be the next thing that\\'s super exciting. I\\'m really big on that.\\nThe modeling stuff continues to make really impressive advances too. I\\'m pretty happy with the first set of Llama 4 releases. We announced four models and released the first two — the Scout and Maverick ones — which are mid-size to small models.\\nThe most popular Llama 3 model was the 8 billion parameter one. So we’ve got one of those coming in the Llama 4 series too. Our internal code name for it is “Little Llama.” That’s coming probably over the next few months.\\nScout and Maverick are good. They have some of the highest intelligence per cost you can get of any model out there. They’re natively multimodal, very efficient, run on one host. They’re designed to be very efficient and low latency, for a lot of the use cases we’re building for internally. That’s our whole thing. We build what we want, and then we open-source it so other people can use it too. I\\'m excited about that.\\nI\\'m also excited about the Behemoth model, which is coming up. It\\'s going to be our first model that\\'s sort of at the frontier — more than 2 trillion parameters. As the name says, it\\'s quite big. We’re trying to figure out how to make that useful for people. It’s so big that we\\'ve had to build a bunch of infrastructure just to be able to post-train it ourselves.\\nNow we\\'re trying to wrap our heads around, how does the average developer out there actually use something like this? How do we make it useful — maybe by distilling it into models that are a reasonable size to run? Because you\\'re obviously not going to want to run something like that in a consumer model.\\nAs you saw with the Llama 3 stuff last year, the initial launch was exciting and then we just built on that over the year. 3.1 released the 405 billion model, 3.2 is when we got all the multimodal stuff in. We basically have a roadmap like that for this year too. So a lot going on.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nI\\'m interested to hear more about it. There\\'s this impression that the gap between the best closed-source and the best open-source models has increased over the last year. I know the full family of Llama 4 models isn\\'t out yet, but Llama 4 Maverick is at #35 on Chatbot Arena. On a bunch of major benchmarks, it seems like o4-mini or Gemini 2.5 Flash are beating Maverick, which is in the same class. What do you make of that impression?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nThere are a few things. First, I actually think this has been a very good year for open source overall. If you go back to where we were last year, Llama was the only real, super-innovative open-source model. Now you have a bunch of them in the field.\\nIn general, the prediction that this would be the year open source generally overtakes closed source as the most used models out there, I think that\\'s generally on track to be true.\\nOne interesting surprise — positive in some ways, negative in others, but overall good — is that it’s not just Llama. There are a lot of good ones out there. I think that\\'s quite good.\\nThen there\\'s the reasoning phenomenon, which you\\'re alluding to talking about o3, o4, and other models. There\\'s a specialization happening. If you want a model that’s the best at math problems, coding, or different things like those tasks, then reasoning models that consume more test-time or inference-time compute in order to provide more intelligence are a really compelling paradigm. And we\\'re building a Llama 4 reasoning model too. It\\'ll come out at some point.\\nBut for a lot of the applications we care about, latency and good intelligence per cost are much more important product attributes. If you\\'re primarily designing for a consumer product, people don\\'t want to wait half a minute to get an answer. If you can give them a generally good answer in half a second, that\\'s a great tradeoff.\\nI think both of these are going to end up being important directions. I’m optimistic about integrating reasoning models with the core language models over time. That\\'s the direction Google has gone in with some of the more recent Gemini models. I think that\\'s really promising. But I think there’s just going to be a bunch of different stuff that goes on.\\nYou also mentioned the whole Chatbot Arena thing, which I think is interesting and points to the challenge around how you do benchmarking. How do you know what models are good for which things?\\nOne of the things we\\'ve generally tried to do over the last year is anchor more of our models in our Meta AI product north star use cases. The issue with open source benchmarks, and any given thing like the LM Arena stuff, is that they’re often skewed toward a very specific set of uses cases, which are often not actually what any normal person does in your product. The portfolio of things they’re trying to measure is often different from what people care about in any given product.\\nBecause of that, we’ve found that trying to optimize too much for that kind of stuff has led us astray. It’s actually not led towards the highest quality product, the most usage, and best feedback within Meta AI as people use our stuff.\\nSo we\\'re trying to anchor our north star on the product value that people report to us, what they say that they want, and what their revealed preferences are, and using the experiences that we have. Sometimes these benchmarks just don\\'t quite line up. I think a lot of them are quite easily gameable.\\nOn the Arena you\\'ll see stuff like Sonnet 3.7, which is a great model, and it\\'s not near the top. It was relatively easy for our team to tune a version of Llama 4 Maverick that could be way at the top. But the version we released, the pure model, actually has no tuning for that at all, so it\\'s further down. So you just need to be careful with some of these benchmarks. We\\'re going to index primarily on the products.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nDo you feel like there is some benchmark which captures what you see as a north star of value to the user which can be be objectively measured between different models and where you\\'d say, \"I need Llama 4 to come out on top on this”?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nOur benchmark is basically user value in Meta AI.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nBut you can\\'t compare that to other models.\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nWe might be able to, because we might be able to run other models and be able to tell. That\\'s one of the advantages of open source. You have a good community of folks who can poke holes in your stuff and point out, \"Okay, where is your model not good, and where is it good?\"\\nThe reality at this point is that all these models are optimized for slightly different mixes of things. Everyone is trying to go towards the same end in that all the leading labs are trying to create general intelligence, superintelligence, whatever you call it. AI that can lead toward a world of abundance where everyone has these superhuman tools to create whatever they want. That leads to dramatically empowering people and creating all these economic benefits.\\nHowever you define it, that\\'s what a lot of the labs are going for. But there\\'s no doubt that different folks have optimized toward different things. I think the Anthropic folks have really focused on coding and agents around that. The OpenAI folks, I think, have gone a little more toward reasoning recently.\\nThere’s a space which, if I had to guess, I think will end up being the most used one: quick, very natural to interact with, natively multimodal, fitting throughout your day in the ways you want to interact with it.\\nI think you got a chance to play around with the new Meta AI app that we\\'re releasing. One of the fun things we put in there is the demo for the full-duplex voice. It\\'s early. There’s a reason why we haven\\'t made that the default voice model in the app yet. But there\\'s something about how naturally conversational it is that\\'s really fun and compelling.\\nBeing able to mix that in with the right personalization is going to lead toward a product experience where… If you fast-forward a few years, I think we\\'re just going to be talking to AI throughout the day about different things we\\'re wondering about.\\nYou\\'ll have your phone. You\\'ll talk to it while browsing your feed apps. It\\'ll give you context about different stuff. It\\'ll answer your questions. It\\'ll help you as you\\'re interacting with people in messaging apps. Eventually, I think we\\'ll walk through our daily lives and have glasses or other kinds of AI devices and just seamlessly interact with it all day long.\\nThat’s the north star. Whatever the benchmarks are that lead toward people feeling like the quality is where they want to interact with it, that\\'s what will ultimately matter the most to us.\\nIntelligence explosion\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nI got a chance to play around with both Orion and also the Meta AI app, and the voice mode was super smooth. It was quite impressive.\\nOn the point of what the different labs are optimizing for — to steelman their view — I think a lot of them believe that once you fully automate software engineering and AI research, then you can kick off an intelligence explosion. You would have millions of copies of these software engineers replicating the research that happened between Llama 1 and Llama 4 — that scale of improvement again — but in a matter of weeks or months rather than years. So it really matters to just close the loop on the software engineer, and then you can be the first to ASI. What do you make of that?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nI personally think that\\'s pretty compelling. That\\'s why we have a big coding effort too. We\\'re working on a number of coding agents inside Meta. Because we\\'re not really an enterprise software company, we\\'re primarily building it for ourselves.\\nAgain, we go for a specific goal. We\\'re not trying to build a general developer tool. We\\'re trying to build a coding agent and an AI research agent that advances Llama research specifically. And it\\'s fully plugged into our toolchain and all that.\\nThat\\'s important and is going to end up being an important part of how this stuff gets done. I would guess that sometime in the next 12 to 18 months, we\\'ll reach the point where most of the code that\\'s going toward these efforts is written by AI. And I don\\'t mean autocomplete.\\nToday you have good autocomplete. You start writing something and it can complete a section of code. I\\'m talking more like: you give it a goal, it can run tests, it can improve things, it can find issues, it writes higher quality code than the average very good person on the team already. I think that\\'s going to be a really important part of this for sure.\\nBut I don\\'t know if that\\'s the whole game. That\\'s going to be a big industry, and it\\'s going to be an important part of how AI gets developed. But I think there are still… One way to think about it is that this is a massive space. I don\\'t think there\\'s just going to be one company with one optimization function that serves everyone as best as possible. There are going to be a bunch of different labs doing leading work in different domains. Some will be more enterprise-focused or coding-focused. Some will be more productivity-focused. Some will be more social or entertainment-focused.\\nWithin the assistant space, there will be some that are more informational and productivity-focused, and some that are more companion-focused. It’s going to be a lot of stuff that’s just fun and entertaining and shows up in your feed.\\nThere\\'s just a huge amount of space. Part of what\\'s fun about going toward this AGI future is that there are a bunch of common threads for what needs to get invented, but also a lot of things that still need to be created. I think you\\'re going to start seeing more specialization between different groups, if I had to guess.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nIt’s really interesting to me that you basically agree with the premise that there will be an intelligence explosion and we’ll get something like superintelligence on the other end. Tell me if I\\'m misunderstanding you. If that’s the case, why even bother with personal assistants and whatever else? Why not just get to superhuman intelligence first and then deal with everything else later?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nI think that\\'s just one aspect of the flywheel. Part of what I generally disagree with on the fast-takeoff view is that it takes time to build out physical infrastructure.\\nIf you want to build a gigawatt cluster of compute, that just takes time. NVIDIA needs time to stabilize their new generation of systems. Then you need to figure out the networking around it. Then you need to build the building. You need to get permitting. You need to get the energy. Maybe that means gas turbines or green energy, either way, there’s a whole supply chain of that stuff.\\nWe talked about this a bunch the last time I was on the podcast with you. I think some of these are just physical-world, human-time things. As you start getting more intelligence in one part of the stack, you’re just going to run into a different set of bottlenecks. That’s how engineering always works: solve one bottleneck, you get another bottleneck.\\nAnother bottleneck in the system or ingredient that’s going to make this work well, is people getting used to learning and having a feedback loop with using the system. These systems don’t just show up fully formed with people magically knowing how to use them. There\\'s a co-evolution that happens where people are learning how to best use these AI assistants. At the same time, the AI assistants are learning what people care about. Developers are making the AI assistants better.\\nYou\\'re building up a base of context too. You wake up a year or two into it and the assistant can reference things you talked about two years ago and that’s pretty cool. You couldn’t do that even if you launched the perfect thing on day one. There’s no way it could reference what you talked about two years ago if it didn’t exist two years ago.\\nSo I guess my view is that there\\'s this huge intelligence growth. There’s a very rapid curve on the uptake of people interacting with the AI assistants, and the learning feedback and data flywheel around that. And then there is also the buildout of the supply chains and infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to enable the scaling of a lot of the physical infrastructure. At some level, all of those are going to be necessary, not just the coding piece.\\nOne specific example of this that I think is interesting. Even if you go back a few years ago, we had a project, I think it was on our ads team, to automate ranking experiments. That\\'s a pretty constrained environment. It\\'s not open-ended code. It’s basically, look at the whole history of the company — every experiment that any engineer has ever done in the ad system — and look at what worked, what didn\\'t, and what the results of those were. Then basically formulate new hypotheses for different tests that we should run that could improve the performance of the ad system.\\nWhat we basically found was that we were bottlenecked on compute to run tests, based on the number of hypotheses. It turns out, even with just the humans we have right now on the ads team, we already have more good ideas to test than we actually have either compute or, really, cohorts of people to test them with.\\nEven if you have three and a half billion people using your products, you still want each test to be statistically significant. It needs to have hundreds of thousands or millions of people. There\\'s only so much throughput you can get on testing through that. So we\\'re already at the point, even with just the people we have, that we can\\'t really test everything that we want.\\nNow just being able to test more things is not necessarily going to be additive to that. We need to get to the point where the average quality of the hypotheses that the AI is generating is better than all the things above the line that we’re actually able to test that the best humans on the team have been able to do, before it will even be marginally useful for it.\\nWe\\'ll get there I think pretty quickly. But it\\'s not just, “Okay, cool, the thing can write code, and now all of a sudden everything is just improving massively.” There are real-world constraints that need to be overcome.\\nThen you need to have the compute and the people to test. Then over time, as the quality creeps up, are we here in five or 10 years where no set of people can generate a hypothesis as good as the AI system? I don\\'t know, maybe. In that world, obviously that\\'s going to be how all the value is created. But that\\'s not the first step.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nSo if you buy this view, that this is where intelligence is headed, the reason to be bullish on Meta is obviously that you have all this distribution. You can also use that to learn more things that can be useful for training. You mentioned the Meta AI app now has a billion active users.\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nNot the app. The app is a standalone thing that we\\'re just launching now. It’ll be fun for people who want to use it. It\\'s a cool experience. We can talk about that too because we’re experimenting with some new ideas in there that I think are novel and worth talking through.\\nBut I’m mostly talking about our apps. Meta AI is actually most used in WhatsApp. WhatsApp is mostly used outside of the U.S. We just passed like a hundred million people in the US, but it\\'s not the primary messaging system in the US, iMessage is. So people in the U.S. probably tend to underestimate Meta AI usage somewhat. But part of the reason the standalone app is going to be so important is because the US, for a lot of reasons, is one of the most important countries. And the fact that WhatsApp is the main way people are using Meta AI and that\\'s not the main messaging system in the US means we need another way to build a first-class experience that\\'s really in front of people.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nAnd I guess, to finish the question, the bearish case would be that if the future of AI is less about just answering your questions and more about being a virtual coworker, then it\\'s not clear how Meta AI inside of WhatsApp gives you the relevant training data to make a fully autonomous programmer or remote worker. In that case, does it not matter that much who has more distribution right now with LLMs?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nAgain, I just think there are going to be different things. Imagine you were sitting at the beginning of the development of the internet and you asked, \"What\\'s going to be the main internet thing? Is it going to be knowledge work or massive consumer apps?\"\\nYou got both. You don’t have to choose one. The world is big and complicated. Does one company build all of that stuff? Normally the answer is no. But to your question, people do not code in WhatsApp for the most part. And I don\\'t foresee that people starting to write code in WhatsApp is going to be a major use case. Although I do think people are going to ask AI to do a lot of things that result in the AI coding without them necessarily knowing it. That\\'s a separate thing.\\nWe do have a lot of people who are writing code at Meta and they use Meta AI. We have this internal thing called MetaMate, and a number of different coding and AI research agents that we\\'re building around that. That has its own feedback loop and I think it can get quite good for accelerating those efforts.\\nBut again, there are going to be a lot of things. AI is almost certainly going to unlock a massive revolution in knowledge work and code. I also think it’s going to be the next generation of search and how people get information, and do more complex information tasks.\\nI also think it\\'s going to be fun. People are going to use it to be entertained. A lot of the internet today is memes and humor. We have this amazing technology at our fingertips. It’s amazing and funny when you think about how much of human energy just goes toward entertaining ourselves, designing, pushing culture forward, and finding humorous ways to explain cultural phenomena that we observe. I think that\\'s almost certainly going to be the case in the future.\\nLook at the evolution of things like Instagram and Facebook. If you go back 10, 15, 20 years ago, it was text. Then we all got phones with cameras, and most of the content became photos. Then the mobile networks got good enough that if you wanted to watch a video on your phone, it wasn\\'t just buffering the whole time. So that got good.\\nOver the last 10 years, most of the content has moved toward video at this point. Today, most of the time spent on Facebook and Instagram is on video. But do you think in five years we’re just going to be sitting in our feed and consuming media that\\'s just video? No, it\\'s going to be interactive. You\\'ll be scrolling through your feed. There will be content that maybe looks like a Reel to start. But you can talk to it, or interact with it, and it talks back, or it changes what it\\'s doing. Or you can jump into it like a game and interact with it. That\\'s all going to be AI.\\nMy point is that there are going to be all these different things. We\\'re ambitious, so we\\'re working on a bunch of them. But I don\\'t think any one company is going to do all of it.\\nAI Friends, Therapists & Girlfriend\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nOn this point about AI-generated content and AI interactions, already people have meaningful relationships with AI therapists, AI friends, maybe more. This is just going to get more intense as these AIs become more unique, more personable, more intelligent, more spontaneous, more funny, and so forth.\\nPeople are going to have relationships with AI. How do we make sure these are healthy relationships?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nThere are a lot of questions that you only can really answer as you start seeing the behaviors. Probably the most important upfront thing is just to ask that question and care about it at each step along the way. But I also think being too prescriptive upfront and saying, \"We think these things are not good\" often cuts off value.\\nPeople use stuff that\\'s valuable for them. One of my core guiding principles in designing products is that people are smart. They know what\\'s valuable in their lives. Every once in a while, something bad happens in a product and you want to make sure you design your product well to minimize that.\\nBut if you think something someone is doing is bad and they think it\\'s really valuable, most of the time in my experience, they\\'re right and you\\'re wrong. You just haven\\'t come up with the framework yet for understanding why the thing they\\'re doing is valuable and helpful in their life. That\\'s the main way I think about it.\\nI do think people are going to use AI for a lot of these social tasks. Already, one of the main things we see people using Meta AI for is talking through difficult conversations they need to have with people in their lives. \"I\\'m having this issue with my girlfriend. Help me have this conversation.” Or, \"I need to have a hard conversation with my boss at work. How do I have that conversation?\" That\\'s pretty helpful. As the personalization loop kicks in and the AI starts to get to know you better and better, that will just be really compelling.\\nHere’s one stat from working on social media for a long time that I always think is crazy. The average American has fewer than three friends, fewer than three people they would consider friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it\\'s something like 15 friends or something. At some point you\\'re like, \"All right, I\\'m just too busy, I can\\'t deal with more people.\"\\nBut the average person wants more connection than they have. There\\'s a lot of concern people raise like, \"Is this going to replace real-world, physical, in-person connections?\" And my default is that the answer to that is probably not. There are all these things that are better about physical connections when you can have them. But the reality is that people just don\\'t have as much connection as they want. They feel more alone a lot of the time than they would like.\\nSo I think a lot of these things — things that today might have a little bit of stigma around them — over time, we\\'ll find the vocabulary as a society to articulate why they are valuable, why the people who are doing them are rational for doing it, and how it is actually adding value to their lives. But also the field is very early. There are a handful of companies doing virtual therapists, virtual girlfriend-type stuff. But it\\'s very early. The embodiment in those things is still pretty weak. You open it up and it\\'s just an image of the therapist or the person you\\'re talking to. Sometimes there\\'s some very rough animation, but it\\'s not an embodiment.\\nYou\\'ve seen the stuff we\\'re working on in Reality Labs, where you have the Codec Avatars and it actually feels like a real person. That\\'s where it\\'s going. You\\'ll be able to have an always-on video chat with the AI. The gestures are important too. More than half of communication, when you\\'re actually having a conversation, is not the words you speak. It\\'s all the nonverbal stuff.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nI did get a chance to check out Orion the other day, and I thought it was super impressive. I\\'m mostly optimistic about the technology. Generally, like you mentioned, I\\'m pretty libertarian about this. If people are doing something, they probably think it\\'s good for them. Although, I actually don\\'t know if it\\'s the case that if somebody is using TikTok, they would say that they\\'re happy with how much time they\\'re spending on TikTok or something.\\nI\\'m mostly optimistic about it in the sense that if we\\'re going to be living in this future world of AGI, we need to be upgrading our capabilities too, with tools like this. And just generally, there can be more beauty in the world if you can see Studio Ghibli everywhere or something.\\nI was worried about one of the flagship use cases that your team showed me. I\\'m sitting at the breakfast table and on the periphery of my vision is just a bunch of Reels that are scrolling by. Maybe in the future, my AI girlfriend is on the other side of the screen or something. So I am worried that we\\'re just removing all the friction between getting totally reward-hacked by our technology. How do we make sure this is not what ends up happening in five years?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nAgain, I think people have a good sense of what they want. That experience you saw was just a demo to show multitasking and holograms. I agree, I don\\'t think the future is one where you have stuff that\\'s trying to compete for your attention in the corner of your vision all the time. I don\\'t think people would like that too much.\\nAs we\\'re designing these glasses, it\\'s actually one of the things that we\\'re really mindful of. Probably the number one thing the glasses need to do is get out of the way and be good glasses. As an aside, I think that\\'s part of the reason why the Ray-Ban Meta product has done so well. It\\'s great for listening to music, taking phone calls, taking photos and videos. The AI is there when you want it. But when you don\\'t, it\\'s just a good-looking pair of glasses that people like. It gets out of the way well.\\nI would guess that\\'s going to be a very important design principle for the augmented reality future. The main thing that I see here is this. It\\'s kind of crazy that, for how important the digital world is in all of our lives, the only way we access it is through these physical, digital screens. You have your phone, your computer. You can put a big TV on your wall. It\\'s this huge physical thing.\\nIt just seems like we\\'re at the point with technology where the physical and digital world should really be fully blended. That\\'s what holographic overlays allow you to do. But I agree. I think a big part of the design principles around that will be around how you\\'ll be interacting with people. You\\'ll be able to bring digital artifacts into those interactions and do cool things very seamlessly.\\nIf I want to show you something, here’s a screen. We can interact with it. It can be 3D. We can play with it. You want to play a card game? All right, here’s a deck of cards. We can play with it. If two of us are physically together and we have a third friend who’s hologramming in, they can participate too.\\nBut in that world too — just as you don\\'t want your physical space to be cluttered because it wears on you psychologically — I don\\'t think people are going to want their digital-physical space to feel that way either. That\\'s more of an aesthetic norm that will have to get worked out, but I think we’ll figure that out.\\nDeepSeek & China\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nGoing back to the AI conversation, you were mentioning how big of a bottleneck the physical infrastructure can be. Related to other open-source models, like DeepSeek and so forth, DeepSeek right now has less compute than a lab like Meta and you could argue that it\\'s competitive with the Llama models.\\nIf China is better at physical infrastructure, industrial scale-ups, getting more power and more data centers online, how worried are you that they might beat us here?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nIt\\'s a real competition. You\\'re seeing industrial policies really play out. China is bringing online more power. Because of that, the US really needs to focus on streamlining the ability to build data centers and produce energy. Otherwise, I think we’ll be at a significant disadvantage.\\nAt the same time, some of the export controls on things like chips, I think you can see how they’re clearly working in a way. There was all the conversation with DeepSeek about, \"Oh, they did all these very impressive low-level optimizations.\" And the reality is, they did and that is impressive.\\nBut then you ask, \"Why did they have to do that, when none of the American labs did it?\" It’s because they’re using partially nerfed chips that are the only ones NVIDIA is allowed to sell in China because of the export controls. DeepSeek basically had to spend a bunch of their calories and time doing low-level infrastructure optimizations that the American labs didn’t have to do.\\nNow, they produced a good result on text. DeepSeek is text-only. The infrastructure is impressive. The text result is impressive. But every new major model that comes out now is multimodal. It\\'s image, it\\'s voice. Theirs isn\\'t.\\nNow the question is, why is that the case? I don’t think it’s because they’re not capable of doing it. It\\'s because they had to spend their calories on doing these infrastructure optimizations to overcome the fact that there were these export controls.\\nBut when you compare Llama 4 with DeepSeek —I mean our reasoning model isn’t out yet, so the R1 comparison isn’t clear yet— but we’re basically in the same ballpark on all the text stuff that DeepSeek is doing but with a smaller model. So the cost-per-intelligence is lower with what we’re doing for Llama on text. On the multimodal side we’re effectively leading at and it just doesn’t exist in their models.\\nSo the Llama 4 models, when you compare them to what DeepSeek is doing, are good. I think people will generally prefer to use the Llama 4 models. But there’s this interesting contour where it’s clearly a good team doing stuff over there. And you\\'re right to ask about the accessibility of power, the accessibility of compute and chips, because the work that you\\'re seeing different labs do and the way it\\'s playing out is somewhat downstream of that.\\nOpen source AI\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nSo Sam Altman recently tweeted that OpenAI is going to release an open-source SOTA reasoning model. I think part of the tweet was that they won’t do anything silly, like say you can only use it if you have less than 700 million users.\\nDeepSeek has the MIT license, whereas I think a couple of the contingencies in the Llama license require you to say \"built with Llama\" on applications using it or any model that you train using Llama has to begin with the word \"Llama.\" What do you think about the license? Should it be less onerous for developers?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nLook, we basically pioneered the open-source LLM thing. So I don\\'t consider the license to be onerous. When we were starting to push on open source, there was this big debate in the industry. Is this even a reasonable thing to do? Can you do something that is safe and trustworthy with open source? Will open source ever be able to be competitive enough that anyone will even care?\\nBasically, when we were answering those questions a lot of the hard work was done by the teams at Meta. There were other folks in the industry but really, the Llama models were the ones that broke open this whole open-source AI thing in a huge way.\\nIf we’re going to put all this energy into it, then at a minimum, if you\\'re going to have these large cloud companies — like Microsoft and Amazon and Google — turn around and sell our model, then we should at least be able to have a conversation with them before they do that around what kind of business arrangement we should have.\\nOur goal with the license, we\\'re generally not trying to stop people from using the model. We just think that if you\\'re one of those companies, or if you\\'re Apple, just come talk to us about what you want to do. Let\\'s find a productive way to do it together. I think that’s generally been fine.\\nNow, if the whole open-source part of the industry evolves in a direction where there are a lot of other great options and the license ends up being a reason why people don’t want to use Llama, then we’ll have to reevaluate the strategy. What it makes sense to do at that point. But I don’t think we’re there.\\nThat’s not, in practice, something we’ve seen, companies coming to us and saying, “We don’t want to use this because your license says if you reach 700 million people, you have to come talk to us.” So far, that’s been more something we’ve heard from open-source purists like, “Is this as clean of an open-source model as you’d like it to be?”\\nThat debate has existed since the beginning of open source. All the GPL license stuff versus other things, do you need to make it so that anything that touches open source has to be open source too? Or can people take it and use it in different ways? I\\'m sure there will continue to be debates around this.\\nBut if you’re spending many billions of dollars training these models, I think asking the other companies — the huge ones that are similar in size and can easily afford to have a relationship with us — to talk to us before they use it seems like a pretty reasonable thing.\\nDwarkesh Patel\\nIf it turns out that other models are also really good. There’s a bunch of good open-source models. So that part of your mission is fulfilled, and maybe other models are better at coding.\\nIs there a world where you just say, \"Look, the open-source ecosystem is healthy. There’s plenty of competition. We\\'re happy to just use some other model, whether it\\'s for internal software engineering at Meta or deploying to our apps. We don\\'t necessarily need to build with Llama\"?\\nMark Zuckerberg\\nAgain, we do a lot of things. Let\\'s take a step back. The reason why we\\'re building our own big models is because we want to be able to build exactly what we want. None of the other models in the world are exactly what we want.\\nIf they\\'re open source, you can take them and fine-tune them in different ways. But you still have to deal with the model architectures. And they make different size tradeoffs that affect latency and inference cost. At the scale that we operate at, that stuff really matters.\\nWe made the Llama Scout and Maverick models certain sizes for a specific reason. They fit on a host and we wanted certain latency'}\n",

We cover Meta’s platform ambitions over the last two decades, the evolution of social networking, and how Zuckerberg has changed his thinking about both. We discuss the Llama API and the tension between GPU opportunity cost and leveraging training costs, and why Zuckerberg thinks that the latter is worth paying for, even if the company has to go it alone. We also discuss why Meta AI may actually bring many of Zuckerberg’s oldest ideas full circle, how that ties into Reality Labs, and why Meta ended up being the perfect name for the company.\\nAs a reminder, all Stratechery content, including interviews, is available as a podcast; click the link at the top of this email to add Stratechery to your podcast player.\\nOn to the Interview:\\nAn Interview with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg About AI and the Evolution of Social Media\\nThis interview is lightly edited for clarity.\\nTopics:\\nFrom f8 to LlamaCon | The Llama API | Meta’s AI Opportunity (Part 1) | The Llama API | Social Networking 2.0 | Meta’s AI Opportunity (Part 2) | The Meta AI App | Tariffs and Reality LabsFrom f8 to LlamaCon\\nMark Zuckerberg, welcome back to Stratechery.\\nMark Zuckerberg: Thanks for having me.\\nSo the occasion for this interview is LlamaCon, a new Meta developer conference. Before I get to that, I wanted to touch on the history of Facebook conferences. So there was F8 from 2007 to 2019, skipped a couple years, prominent announcements included the original Facebook platform, the Open Graph, Parse, there’s a whole bunch of them. It’s interesting though, the vast majority of these are either dead or massively constrained according to the original vision. If you think about this — I dropped this on you out of the blue…\\nMZ: It’s a great start to the conversation.\\nIs that a disappointment or is that a lesson learned? And how do you think about that?\\nMZ: No. Well look, the original Facebook platform was something that really just made sense for web, and it was sort of a pre-mobile thing. As the usage transitioned from desktop web to mobile, Apple basically just said, “You can’t have a platform within a platform and you can’t have apps that use your stuff”. So that whole thing, which had grown to be a meaningful part of our business — I think by the time that we had our IPO in 2012, I think games and apps were about 20% of our business — but that basically just didn’t have much of a future. So we played with different versions of it around Connect and Sign In to different apps and—\\nYeah, the one that’s definitely still around is Sign In with Facebook.\\nMZ: Yeah, and there’s some connectivity between that and developers wanting to get installs for their apps and doing things like that. But it just got very thin, and it was one of these things that I think it’s really just an artifact of Apple’s policies that I think has led to this deep bitterness around not just this, but a number of things where they’ve just said, “Okay, you can’t do these things that we think would be valuable”, which I think to some degree contributes to some of that dynamic between our company and theirs. I think that’s unfortunate. I think a more open mobile—\\nBut there’s a good argument, I made it back then I think in 2013, that this is a great thing for you, it forced you to become what you became.\\nMZ: Well, maybe I think we would’ve become that and also done more. The number of times when we basically I think could have built different experiences into our apps, but we’re just told that we couldn’t, I think it’s hard to look back and think that that created value for the people we’re serving or who were building for. But anyhow, fast-forward to Llama…\\nYeah, well there is Meta Connect. Is the metaverse still a thing?\\nMZ: Yeah, no, absolutely. We wanted a whole event where we could talk about all of the VR and AR stuff that we wanted to do.\\nYeah, that one’s straightforward, that’s clearly a platform.\\nMZ: Part of the reason why we wanted to do LlamaCon is—\\nYeah, you’re anticipating my question. Where is LlamaCon now, the new developer conference?\\nMZ: They’re just different products. Connect around AR and VR attracts a certain type of developer and a certain type of people who are interested in that, and obviously everything is sort of AI going forward too. Like the glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are AI glasses, but it’s a certain type of product. And for people who are primarily focused around building with Llama, we thought it would be useful to have a whole event that was just focused on that, so we made LlamaCon.\\nIt is actually interesting going through the history with F8 and the platform, because obviously a big part of Llama is that it’s open source, and a big part of why we believe in building an open platform is partially the legacy of what’s happened with mobile platforms and all of, from our perspective, pretty arbitrary restrictions that have been placed on developers. I think that’s one of the reasons why developers really want to use open models.\\nIn some ways, it has historically been easier to just get an API from OpenAI or Anthropic or someone, but then you have to deal with the fact that they can just change the API on you overnight and then your app changes, and they can censor what you’re doing with your apps and if they don’t like a query that you’re sending them, then they can just say, “Okay, we’re not going to answer that”, you can’t customize their model as much. So there are all these things that open source allows there that I think we’ve become even more attuned to because of the previous closed platforms that we’ve built on top of that have made us even more wanting to invest in that.\\nBut I think that’s why open source AI is taking off in such a huge way. And of course now it’s not just Llama, you have all these different Chinese models too, DeepSeek and others. I predicted that 2025 was going to be the year that open source became the largest type of model that people are developing with, and I think that’s probably going to be the case. That’s kind of how we’re thinking about this overall.\\nThe Llama API\\nWell, one announcement, which at least when you were talking to me before, you insist it’s small, but I’m not sure it’s going to be taken that way, is this Llama API, what is it and why come out with it now?\\nMZ: Oh, I don’t think it’s small. It’s not necessarily a business that we’re trying to build.\\nGot it.\\nMZ: Which I think is the main thing that people assume whenever you launch a paid API. The main thing that we hear, people love open source for the reasons that I just said, where they want something that they control, that they can customize, that no one is going to take away from them, that they can use however they want, it’s more efficient, it’s cheaper. All these things that are values. The downside of open source until today is that—\\nNo one actually wants to host it.\\nMZ: Is that it takes work to host, right? Yeah. The downside is that it’s much simpler to just make an API call to some established service. Now, there are, of course, a bunch of companies that have made their businesses hosting different models, including open source models, and some of those, I think, are better than others. We went through the Llama 4 launch recently, I think we learned a bunch about how to roll that out. But I think one of the things that didn’t go well was just because we dropped the model and a bunch of the API providers kind of had a bunch of bugs in their implementation, so a lot of the first tests that people had with Llama 4 were using these external API providers that had issues with the implementation.\\nThat was pretty recently, though. Did you make the decision that quickly that actually, “No, we need to have a reference API here”?\\nMZ: No, I was more using that as an example. But even as far back as Llama 3, you can find a lot of people talking about online. “Okay, I want an API provider who’s just providing an unquantized version of the 405B. It’s really hard for me to tell what types of quantization or what kind of shortcuts different API providers are taking, the quality is variable, we just want a good source”. So I think that having a broad ecosystem of API providers is good, and a lot of them do really interesting things, like Groq, for example. Basically with their vertical integration of their building custom silicon to do low latency, it’s really a compelling thing.\\nYou were talking about Groq, the chip, here, not Grok the AI model.\\nMZ: Yeah, Grok is also interesting, [xAI Founder and CEO] Elon [Musk]’s thing, but I’m talking about the chip company. Their business today, they build the chips, they build a vertically integrated service that offers a really low latency API, it’s really cool. I think having an ecosystem where there are companies like that that can use open source models is great.\\nBut I guess just to probably give the topic sentence that I should have given a couple minutes ago when you asked the question, the goal of the Llama API is to provide a reference implementation for the industry. We’re not trying to build a huge business around this, we’re basically trying to make a very simple API that is like vanilla, and people know that it is the model that we intended to build, and that it works, and that you can just drop in your API call for the OpenAI API or whatever else you were using, and you just replace that with the URL for this and that works. Also there isn’t a huge markup, we’re basically offering this at basically our cost of capital.\\nWell, if there isn’t a huge markup, this sounds like it could become a pretty big business, then.\\nMZ: Well, it won’t become very profitable for us.\\nYeah, I know. You’re out there, “Just maybe this little thing, we’re not going to charge very much for it”, I’m not sure those two things are in line.\\nMZ: What do you mean?\\nWell, if you’re not charging very much for it, why doesn’t everybody just go use yours instead of use it from another cloud provider?\\nMZ: Well, in theory, other companies that have this be their whole business should be able to make more interesting and valuable offerings. So we were talking a second ago about Groq that is building custom silicon to do inference for latency-specific optimization.\\nRight. But a lot of Llama use is on AWS, for example.\\nMZ: Sure. And AWS obviously has the value of, they have this whole breadth of services that you are already using for different stuff if you’re an AWS customer.\\nSo if you’re just building an app and you don’t have a lock-in to any cloud, this will be the easiest, cheapest solution?\\nMZ: Yeah. If you want to play with something and you want to know, “Okay, I want to get started with the Llama 4 models, what’s the reference implementation that I know is going to work?”, you can come to this, it will work. And then over time, I would expect that people will play around and optimize for their own use across different services, hosting themselves, whatever kinds of different things once they get to scale. But I think having a reference implementation that’s easy to use is something that the open source ecosystem needs.\\nIf someone gets on there and blows up, are you going to say, “You’re getting a little too big, you need to go somewhere else”?\\nMZ: I don’t know, we haven’t thought that through that much.\\n(laughing) TBD?\\nMZ: Yeah, we haven’t thought that through that much. I think one of the things for us in this is that it’s like, “Why haven’t we built an API yet as a business?”.\\nYeah, that’s my next question.\\nMZ: Why haven’t we built a cloud business overall?\\nEspecially if you’re going to look at this and say, “Yeah, you need to gain leverage on your training costs, you’re spending all this money to train Llama, you need to start making money in more ways from that investment”.\\nMZ: Yeah, I think the dynamic around our business that has been interesting is that it has always been a higher marginal return to allocate incremental GPUs to either better recommendations of content and feeds or ads.\\nYeah, that’s my view. I’ve defended you not having an API for that very reason.\\nMZ: Exactly. So now in this case, we think it’s valuable if Llama grows, and we think that having a reference implementation API is a valuable thing for it growing. So we think that this is a thing that needs to exist, but that economics is why I’m not looking at this as a large business. I think if this ends up consuming a massive, massive number of GPUs, you can make an argument that if it’s profitable, then that’s good and we should just do that and all the recommendation stuff that we do.\\nRight, there’s opportunity costs these days.\\nMZ: And obviously you can’t ever perfectly forecast how many GPUs you should build. So in practice, we’re always making these calculations internally, which is like, “All right, should I give the Instagram Reels team more GPUs or should I give this other team more GPUs to build the thing that they’re doing?”, and I would guess that having an API business is going to be pretty low on the list of things that we want to pull recommendations service GPUs away from towards. But that said, we have a huge fleet, right? Gigawatts of data centers and all that. So having a very small amount of that go towards a reference implementation to help make it simple for people to start using open source AI seems like a good thing to do. But again, that’s kind of the big picture.\\nIf someone gets really big, there might be some conversations to be had.\\nMZ: We’ll see, we’ll see.\\nWe’ll get there when we get there.\\nMZ: I think in general in this kind of business, you’re happy when people grow big and scale.\\nNo, of course. It’s a good problem to have. I just think it’s really interesting to think about this cost issue where you are talking about the concern and why I share that concern is the inference. You can use those GPUs for your own usage, versus them, so there’s a real trade-off here, but the other issue that I just mentioned before is the cost of the training, and you’re spending billions of dollars to train a model, how do you maximize your return on that training? That’s why a lot of investors, I think, like the idea of you doing an API. Another option that’s been rumored out there, lots of other companies are finding benefit from Llama, should they be contributing more to training? Is that something that you are looking to pursue? Are there going to be any takers?\\nMZ: We’ve talked to some folks about that, and so far it hasn’t come together. It may as the cost keeps scaling, but so far it actually seems like the number of efforts actually are still proliferating.\\nRight.\\nMZ: So companies that I would’ve expected would’ve wanted to kind of get on board with Llama as an open source standard and then be able to save costs have actually turned around and spun up new efforts to build up their own models, so we’ll see how that turns out. I’d guess that in the next couple of years, the training runs are going to be on gigawatt clusters, and I just think that there will be consolidation.\\nPeople are going to bow out at some point.\\nMZ: But look, I’m doing our financial planning assuming that we’re paying the cost of this, so it’s upside if we end up being able to share it with other people, but we don’t need it.\\nRight.\\nMZ: I think that that’s one of the things that is kind a positive for us. And I can kind of take you through the business case, if that’s helpful on this.\\nMeta’s AI Opportunity (Part 1)\\nWell, I do want to ask about your open source strategy generally. On one hand, as an overall observer of the industry, I’m really quite grateful for it, and I think you really opened up the floodgates for this, I think overcame some perhaps well-intentioned, but misplaced reticence about the broad availability of these models. On the other hand, large companies have been major contributors to open source, including Facebook, including Meta. You’ve compared Llama to the Open Compute Project. In that case, you had data centers all over the world adopting your standards, you had hardware makers building to them, all of which accrued to your bottom line at the end of the day and to your point, you’re not a data center provider, so it’s all gravy. I guess the question for Llama is, what are the economic payoffs from this open sourcing, particularly when you think about, “Well, maybe we do want to tune it to ourselves”. Is it just a branding thing? Is it just that researchers like that it’s open source? Particularly the economic part of it.\\nMZ: The decision to open source is downstream from the decision to build it, right? We’re not building it so that we can open source it for developers, we’re building it because it’s a thing that we believe that we need in order to build the services that we want. And then, there’s this whole question of like, “Do you need to be at the frontier? Can you be six months behind or whatever?”, and I believe that over time, you want to be at the frontier. Especially one of the dynamics that we’re seeing around — there are a couple of things. One is that you’re starting to see some specialization, so the different companies are better at different things and focusing on different things, and our use cases are just going to be a little bit different from others. I think at the scale that we operate, it just makes sense to build something that is really tuned for your usage.\\nWhat are the specifics that are important for you?\\nMZ: This is going to take us a little afield from the question that I was just answering.\\nThat’s fine.\\nMZ: I basically think that there are four major product and business opportunities that are the things that we’re looking at and I’ll start from the most simplest and probably the ones that are the easiest to do to the things that are further afield from where we are today. So most basic of the four. Use AI to make it so that the ads business goes a lot better.\\nYeah.\\nMZ: Improve recommendations, make it so that any business that basically wants to achieve some business outcome can just come to us, not have to produce any content, not have to know anything about their customers. Can just say, “Here’s the business outcome that I want, here’s what I’m willing to pay, I’m going to connect you to my bank account, I will pay you for as many business outcomes as you can achieve”. Right?\\nMZ: Yeah, it is basically like the ultimate business agent, and if you think about the pieces of advertising, there’s content creation, the creative, there’s the targeting, and there’s the measurement and probably the first pieces that we started building were the measurement to basically make it so that we can effectively have a business that’s organized around when we’re delivering results for people instead of just showing them impressions.\\nOutcomes, yeah.\\nMZ: And then, we start off with basic targeting. Over the last 5 to 10 years, we’ve basically gotten to the point where we effectively discourage businesses from trying to limit the targeting. It used to be that a business would come to us and say like, “Okay, I really want to reach women aged 18 to 24 in this place”, and we’re like, “Okay. Look, you can suggest to us…”\\nRight. But I promise you, we’ll find more people at a cheaper rate.\\nMZ: If they really want to limit it, we have that as an option. But basically, we believe at this point that we are just better at finding the people who are going to resonate with your product than you are. And so, there’s that piece.\\nBut there’s still the creative piece, which is basically businesses come to us and they have a sense of what their message is or what their video is or their image, and that’s pretty hard to produce and I think we’re pretty close.\\nAnd the more they produce, the better. Because then, you can test it, see what works. Well, what if you could just produce an infinite number?\\nMZ: Yeah, or we just make it for them. I mean, obviously, it’ll always be the case that they can come with a suggestion or here’s the creative that they want, especially if they really want to dial it in. But in general, we’re going to get to a point where you’re a business, you come to us, you tell us what your objective is, you connect to your bank account, you don’t need any creative, you don’t need any targeting demographic, you don’t need any measurement, except to be able to read the results that we spit out. I think that’s going to be huge, I think it is a redefinition of the category of advertising. So if you think about what percent of GDP is advertising today, I would expect that that percent will grow. Because today, advertising is sort of constrained to like, “All right, I’m buying a billboard or a commercial…”\\nRight. I think it was always either 1% or 2%, but digital advertising has already increased that.\\nMZ: It has grown, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it grew by a very meaningful amount.\\nI’m with you. You’re preaching to the choir, everyone should embrace the black box. Just go there, I’m with you. So what’s number two?\\nMZ: Number two is basically growing engagement on the consumer surfaces and recommendations. So part one of that is just get better at showing people the content that’s out there, that’s effectively what’s happening with Reels. Then I think what’s going to start happening is that the AI is not just going to be recommending content, but it is effectively going to be either helping people create more content or just creating it themselves.\\nYou can think about our products as there have been two major epochs so far. The first was you had your friends and you basically shared with them and you got content from them and now, we’re in an epoch where we’ve basically layered over this whole zone of creator content. So the stuff from your friends and followers and all the people that you follow hasn’t gone away, but we added on this whole other corpus around all this content that creators have that we are recommending.\\nHow do you feel about that? Because I wrote back in 2015 that that’s what you needed to do. But then it was like, “No, we connect people and that’s how we figure things-“\\nMZ: Let me finish answering this and then can we come back to that?\\nOkay, I want to get into the psyche here.\\nMZ: Well, the third epoch is I think that there’s going to be all this AI-generated content and you’re not going to lose the others, you’re still going to have all the creator content, you’re still going to have some of the friend content. But it’s just going to be this huge explosion in the amount of content that’s available, very personalized and I guess one point, just as a macro point, as we move into this AGI future where productivity dramatically increases, I think what you’re basically going to see is this extrapolation of this 100-year trend where as productivity grows, the average person spends less time working, and more time on entertainment and culture. So I think that these feed type services, like these channels where people are getting their content, are going to become more of what people spend their time on, and the better that AI can both help create and recommend the content, I think that that’s going to be a huge thing. So that’s kind of the second category.\\nI’ll answer your question before we go to the third category.\\nSocial Networking 2.0\\nHow do you feel about Facebook being more than just connecting to your friends and family now?\\nMZ: I think it’s been a good change overall, but I think I sort of missed why. It used to be that you interacted with the people that you were connecting with in feed, like someone would post something and you’d comment in line and that would be your interaction.\\nToday, we think about Facebook and Instagram and Threads, and I guess now, the Meta AI app too and a bunch of other things that we’re doing, as these discovery engines. Most of the interaction is not happening in feed. What’s happening is the app is like this discovery engine algorithm for showing you interesting stuff and then, the real social interaction comes from you finding something interesting and putting it in a group chat with friends or a one-on-one chat. So there’s this flywheel between messaging which has become where actually all the real, deep, nuanced social interaction is online and the feed apps, which I think have increasingly just become these discovery engines.\\nDid you have this vision when you bought WhatsApp? Or did you back into it?\\nMZ: I thought messaging was going to be important. Honestly, part of the reason why we were a little bit late to competing with TikTok was because I didn’t fully understand this when TikTok was first growing. And then by using it, I was like, “Oh, okay, this is not just video, this is a complete reconsideration of the way that social media is formulated”. Where just going forward, people are not primarily going to be interacting in line, it’s going to be primarily about content and then, most of the interaction is going to be in messaging and group chat.\\nThere’s a line there that I’ve criticized you for at the time, I think you’ve backed away from it, something about being your whole self everywhere. And one of my takes on group chats, in general, is it lets you be different facets of yourself with different groups of people as appropriate.\\nMZ: Yeah, totally. Messaging, I think, does this very well. One of the challenges that we’ve always had with services like Facebook and Instagram is you end up accumulating friends or followers over time and then, the question is, who are you talking to there?\\nRight.\\nMZ: So if you’re a creator, you have an audience that kind of makes sense. But if you’re a normal person just trying to socialize—\\nYou really don’t want to go viral. I can promise you that.\\nMZ: No, no. What I’m saying is you basically want to — people want to share very authentically and you’re just willing to share more in small groups. So the modern day configuration of this is that messaging is a much better structure for this, because you don’t just have one group that you share with. You have all these different group chats and you have all your one-on-one threads. So it’s like I can share stuff with my family, I can share stuff with people I do sports with.\\nIn the end, you were worried about Google Circles and then you ended up owning it in the end.\\nMZ: It just ended up being in messaging instead of in a feed. Which I think gets us to, if you still want to go through this…\\nMeta’s AI Opportunity (Part 2)\\nMZ: The third big AI revenue opportunity is going to be business messaging. Because as messaging gets built up as its own huge social ecosystem, if you think about our business today, Facebook revenue is quite strong, Instagram revenue is quite strong, WhatsApp is on the order of almost, I think, 3 billion people using it — much less revenue than either Facebook or Instagram.\\nIt just stores the soul of Facebook, per our conversation.\\nMZ: But I think between WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram Direct, these messaging services, I think, should be very large business ecosystems in their own right. And the way that I think that’s going to happen, we see the early glimpses of this because business messaging is actually already a huge thing in countries like Thailand and Vietnam.\\nRight. Where they have workers who can afford to do the messaging.\\nMZ: Low cost of labor. So what we see is Thailand and Vietnam are, I think last time I checked, this may not be exactly right, but I think it was something like they were our number 6 and 7 countries by revenue or something, they were definitely in the Top 10. If you look at those countries by GDP, they’re in the 30s. So it’s like, “Okay, what’s going on?”. Well, it’s that business messaging — I mean, I saw some stuff that I think it’s something like 2% of Thailand’s GDP goes through people transacting through our messaging apps.\\nYeah. This is one of those things where my being in Asia, I’ve seen this coming for ages and it feels like it’s taken forever to actually accomplish.\\nMZ: So what will unlock that for the rest of the world? It’s like, it’s AI making it so that you can have a low cost of labor version of that everywhere else. So you have more than a hundred million small businesses that use our platforms and I just think it seems pretty clear that within a few years, every business in the world basically has an email address, a social media account, a website, they’re going to have an AI that can do customer support and sales. And once they have that and that’s driving conversions for them — first of all, we can offer that as a product that’s super easy to spin up and that it’s going to be free. We’re not even going to charge you until we start driving incremental conversions. Then like, “Yeah, you just stand this thing up and we’ll just start sending sales your way and you can pay us some fee for the incremental sales”.\\nOnce you start getting that flywheel going, the demand that businesses are going to have to drive people to those chats is going to really go up. So I think that’s going to be how we’re going to monetize WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram Direct, and all that. So that’s the third pillar.\\nAnd then, the fourth is all the more novel, just AI first thing, so like Meta AI. Eventually, if that grows, it’ll be recommending products, people will be paying for subscriptions and things like that. So Meta AI is around a billion people using it monthly now.\\nI want to ask about Meta AI, but it feels like there’s two more pillars or potential pillars from my perspective. We mentioned the metaverse earlier, I feel like generative AI is going to be the key to the metaverse. Because even just with gaming on a screen we’ve hit a limit on assets, assets just cost too much to create, so that’s going to solve problems there.\\nThen, we also have, it just feels like this entire canvas of people who are in these apps and experiencing it, like I feel like every pixel could be monetized. You see an influencer, every single item in that you could recognize it, know it, have a link to it, whoever the purveyor of that product is signed up. The takeaway here is I feel like — and this is a compliment, not an insult — you’re the Microsoft of consumer. In that Microsoft just wins continuously, because they own that distribution channel and they have that connection to everyone, you own this distribution. To your point, more free time, people spending more time in these apps, there’s so many ways to do this. Why do you also need a chatbot and a dedicated app for that?\\nMZ: Well, I guess if you look at the four categories that we just talked through of the big business opportunities, it’s increasing the ad experience, increasing the consumer experience on engagement, business messaging, which is basically going to build out the business around all our messaging services to the level that we’ve built with Facebook and Instagram. And then, the fourth is just the AI-native thing. So I mentioned Meta AI, because it’s the biggest, it has about a billion people using it today.\\nAnd you have a new app.\\nMZ: Well, the billion people using it today are across the family of apps, but now, we have the standalone app too. So for people who want that, you can have that. But it also includes stuff like creating content in the metaverse, it’s all the AI-native stuff. So when we’ve done our financial planning, we don’t need all of those to work in order for this to be a very profitable thing. If we really hit out of the park on two or three of those, were in pretty good shape, even with the massive cost of training.\\nBut I think that this gets to the question around, in order to really do the world-class work in each of those areas, I think you want to build an end-to-end experience where you are training the model that you need in order to have the capabilities that it needs to deliver each of those things. In all the experience I’ve had so far, you really just want to be able to go all the way down the stack. Meta’s a full-stack company, we’ve always built our own infrastructure and we’ve built our own AI systems, we built our own products.\\nI’m on board with doing your own model. Is there a bit where because it became so popular as an open source project and you’re here at LlamaCon and now, you have developers saying, “Can you make your model do this?”, and you’re like, “Well, we’re actually doing it to…”?\\nMZ: Oh, I see. Yeah, I think that that’s going to be an interesting trade-off over time is we definitely are building it first and foremost for our use cases, and then we’re making it available for developers as they want to use it. The Llama 4 Maverick model was not designed for any of the open source benchmarks, and I think that was some of the reason why when people use it, they’re like, “Okay, this feels pretty good”, but then on some of the benchmarks, it’s not scoring quite as high, but is it a high quality model.\\nWell, if you used the right model, it might’ve scored high.\\nMZ: What’s that?\\nIf you use the right model, it might’ve scored high.\\nMZ: What do you mean?\\nWell, there was a little bit of a controversy about a model that was trained specifically for a test.\\nMZ: Oh, well, that’s actually sort of interesting. One of the things that we designed Llama 4 to be able to do is be more steerable than other models because we have different use cases. We have Meta AI, we’re building AI Studio, we want to make it so that you can use it for business messaging, all these things. So it is fundamentally a more adaptable model when it was designed to be that, than what you can do with taking something like GPT or Claude and trying to fine-tune it to the extent that they’ll let you to do a different thing.\\nI guess there was a team that built, steered a version of it to be really good at LMArena and it was able to do that, because it’s steerable. But then I think the version that’s up there now is not optimized for LMArena at all, so it’s like, “Okay, so it scores the way that it does”.\\nBut anyway, it’s a good model. The point that you are making I think is right, that as we design it for our own uses, there are some things that open source developers care about that we are not going to be the purveyor of. But part of the beauty of it being open source is other people can do those things. Open source is an ecosystem, it’s not a provider, so we are doing probably the hardest part of it, in terms of taking these very expensive pre-training runs and doing a lot of work and then making that available and we’re also standing up infrastructure to have a reference implementation API now, but we’re not trying to do the whole thing. There’s a huge opportunity both for other companies to come do that and I expect that, just like with Linux, there were all these other projects that emerged around it to build up all the other functionality, and drivers, and all that different stuff that was necessary for it to be useful for all the things that developers wanted. That’ll exist with Llama, too.\\nThe Meta AI App\\nWhy do you think it’s important to have the Meta AI app?\\nMZ: Well, I think some people just want to use it as a standalone app.\\nWhat do you think they want to use it for? Is this a do homework app? I find that your observation about more free time and that’s something you can fill, I agree, and in some respects I feel like it’s been a journey to lean into being the entertainment company and being okay with that, and maybe people will do their homework somewhere else and when they’re done with their homework, then they’ll come play with you.\\nMZ: Yeah. I think that there is part of that that I think is probably right. I think AI is by definition a general technology, so I think you want to be'}\n",

The danger is this leads to deferred decision making or forces companies to absorb or pass on higher costs, which will either affect their profit margins or potentially weaken demand for their datacenter services.\\nIn the broader context, ABI claims the tariffs are prompting a shift in supply chain dynamics, leading bit barn operators to further diversify their component sourcing strategies and possibly invest in more local manufacturing to mitigate increasing costs.\\n\"While this may foster a sense of national self-reliance in the United States, it could result in more fragmented and less cost-efficient global supply chains and loss of comparative advantages,\" says principal analyst Sebastian Wilke.\\n\"These combined factors put pressure on datacenter operators to reevaluate both short-term and long-term strategies, affecting pricing models, investment decisions, and demand forecasts.\"\\nAlthough semiconductors are currently exempt from the latest round of tariffs, the broader IT landscape still faces \"considerable headwinds\" due to those baseline import tariffs, with the most immediate pressure falling on AI infrastructure, according to ABI.\\n\"Take HPE, a leading US AI server OEM – it sources components and materials from Mexico, China, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Malaysia, and beyond, while also relying on commercial operations in the Czech Republic. Imposing tariffs on these foreign-sourced components and raw materials will substantially increase the cost of manufacturing AI servers,\" warns principal analyst Reece Hayden.\\nHPE itself highlighted this in its Q1 earnings report, in which it forecast lower revenue for Q2 because of the tariff turmoil.\\n- Microsoft tries to kill the \\'pausing datacenter builds must be bad news for AI\\' trope\\n- Samsung customers buying now to avoid future tariffs – and may slow purchases once they arrive\\n- Microsoft gets twitchy over talk of Europe\\'s tech independence\\n- Trump admin freaks out over mere suggestion Amazon was going to show tariff impact on prices\\nEven companies like Supermicro, which emphasizes its \"Made in the USA\" branding, will not be immune, Hayden adds, as these still depend heavily on overseas-sourced components such as memory. The company this week warned that its upcoming quarterly results are likely to miss forecast revenue by a substantial margin.\\nThis creates a difficult choice for server makers: absorb the costs and see profit margins shrink, or pass them on to customers through price hikes.\\n\"In the United States, customers may have limited negotiating power and little choice other than to accept higher prices, but internationally, buyers will have greater flexibility and may be able to pivot to non-US alternatives with more cost-competitive offerings (Lenovo, Huawei),\" Hayden says.\\nThe net potential impact is a slowdown in datacenter expansion, and a subsequent reduction in demand for key components, especially high-performance semiconductors, he forecasts.\\nThis is likely to be exacerbated by buyers that have already stockpiled key components ahead of the tariffs taking effect. Samsung just attributed record revenue to customers rushing to buy before the US raises tariffs on imports, and fellow Korean memory maker SK hynix reported a similar phenomenon in April.\\nABI notes that companies like TSMC and Intel have committed to significant investments in semiconductor manufacturing on US soil, but tariffs now threaten these projects by raising the cost of construction via costlier imported raw materials and foreign equipment such as ASML\\'s lithography systems.\\n\"The likely outcomes are grim: projects could be paused in hopes of riding out policy changes or canceled altogether due to diminishing Return on Investment (ROI),\" Hayden says.\\nWhile a theoretical solution could involve reinvesting tariff revenue to support domestic manufacturing, \"that scenario appears politically unlikely,\" he adds.\\nThe most probable outcome is therefore a long-term pullback in AI-related infrastructure investment, ABI predicts, with slower growth in server manufacturing, reduced expansion of datacenter capacity, and even a decline in America\\'s leading position in the global AI market.\\n\"Increasing input costs will put pressure on IT budgets, and CIOs – already under scrutiny – will need to reassess their AI roadmaps,\" Hayden warns, adding that \"for some, AI will be seen as an expensive \\'nice to have,\\' especially for early-stage deployments that haven\\'t delivered ROI.\"\\nThese projects are likely to be paused or scrapped, with ABI forecasting the net effect will be a near-term slowdown of AI adoption, as financial constraints push organizations to prioritize ROI-positive initiatives.\\nIt would be ironic if President Trump\\'s tariff policies, designed to rebuild American industry and domestic manufacturing, actually led to the US losing AI supremacy to China. ®'}\n",

It\\'s a fast-growing project, and I wanted to get familiar with the updates. I also wanted to check how to integrate a Model Context Protocol server in LangChain4J.\\nVersion 1 Beta\\nI wrote my last post in November 2024 and used the latest version available at the time, v0.35. LangChain4J started its journey toward 1.0 last December.\\n|\\nDate |\\nRelease |\\n|---|---|\\n|\\nSeptember 25th, 2024 |\\n0.35.0 |\\n|\\nDecember 22th, 2024 |\\n1.0.0-alpha1 |\\n|\\nFebruary 10th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta1 |\\n|\\nMarch 13th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta2 |\\n|\\nApril 12th, 2025 |\\n1.0.0-beta3 |\\nLangChain4J follows SemVer. Maintainers used the occasion to introduce breaking changes. In my case, I had to update my code to account for breaking API changes.\\n|\\nv0.35 |\\nv1.0.0-beta3 |\\n|---|---|\\n|\\nval s = Sinks.many() |\\nval s = Sinks.many() |\\nProject Reactor Integration\\nLangChain4J offers a Project Reactor integration; I missed it in my previous musings. With Kotlin coroutines, it simplifies the code a lot.\\nI\\'m using AiServices\\n, so I previously defined an interface for LangChain4J to implement at runtime:\\ninterface ChatBot {\\nfun talk(@MemoryId sessionId: String, @UserMessage message: String): TokenStream\\n}\\nWe should add the following dependency:\\n<dependency>\\n<groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>\\n<artifactId>langchain4j-reactor</artifactId>\\n<version>1.0.0-beta3</version>\\n</dependency>\\nWe can now change the return type from a Flux<String>\\nto a TokenStream\\n. Here\\'s the updated signature:\\ninterface ChatBot {\\nfun talk(@MemoryId sessionId: String, @UserMessage message: String): Flux<String>\\n}\\nIt makes the creation of the sink\\nabove unnecessary. We can simplify the code as follows:\\nval flux = chatBot.talk(m.sessionId, m.text)\\nServerResponse.ok().bodyAndAwait(flux.asFlow())\\nRemember that two days of debugging can easily save you two hours of reading the documentation! I didn\\'t do the latter.\\nIntegrating a Model Context Protocol Server\\nUp to this point, our changes were minimal. In this section, I want to integrate an <abbr title=\"Model Context Protocol\">MCP</abbr> in my LangChain4J application.\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation\\nOne needs lots and lots of resources to train an <abbr title=\"Large Language Model\">LLM</abbr>: it directly translates into time and money. For this reason, companies limit the training of new model versions. A model\\'s relevancy decreases over time as information accrues and changes, while the LLM\\'s database is immutable. Moreover, LLMs are trained on public data–by nature, while most companies want to query their private data too.\\nRetrieval Augmented Generation was the traditional way to cope with these limits. Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a two-step process. In the first step, the tool parses data, vectorizes it according to the LLM, and stores it in a vector database; in the second, the tool uses the database as additional data when querying the LLM.\\nModel Context Protocol\\nThe most recent way to handle the static nature of LLMs is MCP.\\nMCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.\\nMCP has two benefits over RAG:\\n-\\nData processed by a RAG is tailored for a model. If one wants to use a new model, one must re-execute the parsing phase. MCP standardizes the interactions between a client and a server, making them technology-independent.\\n-\\nRAG allows the reading of data. MCP allows any API call to either access data dynamically or execute actions!\\nMCP defines two transport alternatives for client-server communications:\\n- stdio: The client launches a subprocess, and communication happens over standard in and standard out\\n- HTTP with Server-Sent Events\\nArchitecting the Solution\\nAfter the above theory, we are now ready for the hands-on part. It starts by choosing an MCP server. Here\\'s a good starting point. However, I chose the official GitHub MCP server because the LangChain4J documentation mentions it.\\nThe GitHub MCP server offers the stdio transport. It means we should get the binary and start it from the application. It\\'s fast compared to the HTTP transport, but given the overall time comprising the HTTP call to the model and the compute time on its side, it\\'s irrelevant. From an architecture point of view, I\\'d prefer a dedicated component with its process.\\nAfter some research, I found the mcp-proxy project. It lets you switch between either from stdio to HTTP or from HTTP to stdio. It\\'s also available as a Docker image. We can combine both the server and the proxy with the following Dockerfile\\n:\\nFROM ghcr.io/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy:latest\\nENV VERSION=0.2.0\\nENV ARCHIVE_NAME=github-mcp-server_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz\\nRUN wget https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/releases/download/v$VERSION/$ARCHIVE_NAME -O /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME \\\\ #1\\n&& tar -xzvf /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME -C /opt \\\\ #2\\n&& rm /tmp/$ARCHIVE_NAME #3\\nRUN chmod +x /opt/github-mcp-server #4\\n- Download the archive\\n- Extract it\\n- Remove the archive\\n- Make the binary executable\\nNote that we can\\'t define the CMD\\nas the binary only allows configuring the port and the host with parameters. For this reason, we must defer the command at runtime, or in my case, in the docker-compose.yaml\\n:\\nservices:\\nmcp-server:\\nbuild:\\ncontext: github-mcp-server\\nenv_file:\\n- .env #1\\ncommand:\\n- --pass-environment #2\\n- --sse-port=8080 #3\\n- --sse-host=0.0.0.0 #4\\n- -- #5\\n- /opt/github-mcp-server #6\\n- --toolsets\\n- all\\n- stdio\\n- We need a\\nGITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\\nenvironment variable with a valid token to authenticate on GitHub - Pass all environment variables to the subprocess\\n- Set the listening port\\n- Bind to any IP\\n- The proxy \"connects\" to the stdio MCP server after the dash\\n- Run the server with all options enabled\\nThe image will provide the /sse\\nendpoint on port 8080.\\nCoding the Solution\\nThe coding part is the easiest. Head down to the LangChain4J documentation on MCP and follow along. In the project, it translates as the following:\\nbean {\\nval transport = HttpMcpTransport.Builder()\\n.sseUrl(ref<ApplicationProperties>().mcp.url) //1\\n.logRequests(true) //2\\n.logResponses(true) //2\\n.build()\\nval mcpClient = DefaultMcpClient.Builder()\\n.transport(transport)\\n.build()\\nmcpClient.listTools().forEach { println(it) } //3\\nMcpToolProvider.builder()\\n.mcpClients(listOf(mcpClient))\\n.build()\\n}\\nbean {\\ncoRouter {\\nval chatBot = AiServices\\n.builder(ChatBot::class.java)\\n.streamingChatLanguageModel(ref<StreamingChatLanguageModel>())\\n.chatMemoryProvider { MessageWindowChatMemory.withMaxMessages(40) }\\n.contentRetriever(EmbeddingStoreContentRetriever.from(ref<EmbeddingStore<TextSegment>>()))\\n.toolProvider(ref<McpToolProvider>()) //4\\n.build()\\nPOST(\"/\")(PromptHandler(chatBot)::handle)\\n}\\n}\\n- I added a\\nConfigurationProperty\\nclass to parameterize the SSE URL - The MCP protocol provides a way to send logs back to the client\\n- Not necessary, but it helped me to make sure the client connected to the server and could list the tools provided\\n- Plug in the MCP tool provider created above in the\\nAiServices\\nAt this point, the model should forward a request that matches any of the registered tools to the MCP server.\\ncurl -N -H \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' localhost:8080 -d \\'{ \"sessionId\": \"1\", \"text\": \"What are my top three most popular GitHub repos?\" }\\'\\nI tried multiple times, and I got answers along these lines:\\nUnfortunately, the provided text does not contain any information about your top three most popular GitHub repositories. The text appears to be a blog post or a personal website, and it mentions some of your projects and experiences with GitHub, but it does not provide any metrics or statistics on the popularity of your repositories.\\nIf you want to know more about the popularity of your GitHub repositories, I would recommend checking out GitHub\\'s own analytics tools, such as GitHub Insights or the Repository Insights API. These tools can provide information about the number of followers, stars, and forks for each repository, as well as other metrics like engagement and activity.\\nThe model just ignored the tools despite the documentation claiming the contrary.\\nFixing the Solution\\nI read the LangChain4J documentation a couple of times, but to no avail. I tried to use OpenAI and a handful of other AI tools with no success. Most of the answers confirmed it should work out of the box. Some mentioned calling the tool directly, which defeats the purpose; one mentioned that Ollama didn\\'t support tools. I checked the Ollama blog: it announced tools\\' support in 2024. I was stuck for nearly a day, wondering what I did wrong.\\nThe decoupled architecture introduces more moving pieces. I suspected something might be wrong in the whole call chain. I removed the MCP proxy, added the github-mcp-server\\ndirectly to the application image, and changed the code from HTTP to stdio. It didn\\'t fix the issue.\\nI was about to abandon when I decided to come back to the roots. I copied-pasted the sample from the documentation: it just worked! It was my ha-ha moment.\\nThe sample uses OpenAI, while I was using Ollama. I tried MCP with OpenAI, Mistral AI, and Ollama. Only the OpenAI model works with MCP. I sent the same request as above:\\ncurl -N -H \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' localhost:8080 -d \\'{ \"sessionId\": \"1\", \"text\": \"What are my top three most popular GitHub repos?\" }\\'\\nNow, OpenAI correctly maps the request to the correct tool and returns the answer I was expecting:\\nHere are my findings regarding your top three most popular GitHub repositories:\\n1. **[opentelemetry-tracing](https://github.com/nfrankel/opentelemetry-tracing)**\\n- **Description**: Demo for end-to-end tracing via OpenTelemetry.\\n- **Stars**: 68\\n- **Forks**: 25\\n- **Open Issues**: 10\\n2. **[kaadin](https://github.com/nfrankel/kaadin)**\\n- **Description**: Kotlin DSL for Vaadin.\\n- **Stars**: 44\\n- **Forks**: 12\\n- **Open Issues**: 3\\n3. **[jvm-controller](https://github.com/nfrankel/jvm-controller)**\\n- **Description**: Example on how to write a Kubernetes controller in Java.\\n- **Stars**: 33\\n- **Forks**: 10\\n- **Open Issues**: 0\\nThese repositories demonstrate a range of your interests and contributions in the areas of observability, Kotlin development, and Kubernetes.%\\nBecause we pass an authentication token to the MCP server, which passes it to the GitHub API, the latter knows which user makes the call. Hence, it can interpret the my repos part in the above query. I admit that it\\'s an unusual use case for regular web applications that cater to multiple users, but use a single authentication token each. However, it perfectly fits the use case of a desktop application.\\nOther regular questions, e.g., find the most popular repositories on GitHub, are relevant to web applications, as they don\\'t have implicit context–the user.\\nConclusion\\nThe main focus of this post is the integration of an MCP server in a LangChain4J app. While the configuration is straightforward thanks to the documentation, there are a few caveats.\\nFirst, how the MCP server fits in your architecture is still up to you. I had to be creative to make it decoupled, using the excellent mcp-proxy\\n. Then, LangChain4J appears to be a leaky abstraction. It makes everything possible to provide you with a strong abstraction layer, but the implementations underneath it shields you from are not equal. I wish the documentation would mention it, even though I understand the current version is in beta.\\nAll in all, it was a fun ride. I learned about MCP in the real world, and it opened quite a few doors for project ideas.\\nThe complete source code for this post can be found on GitHub.\\nTo go further:\\n- Get started with the Model Context Protocol\\n- Find Awesome MCP Servers and Clients\\n- LangChain4J - Model Context Protocol (MCP)\\nOriginally published on A Java Geek on April 27th, 2025'}\n",

She looks like one of millions of fashion models that could grace the websites of retailers and mom-and-pop eCommerce sites.\\nShe was also created using artificial intelligence (AI).\\nA growing number of companies are offering a retail marketing service that lets businesses upload images of clothing and transform them into fashion model shoots customized by body type, ethnicity and more.\\nOne of them is BetterStudio, which launched in March after its predecessor, AI Modeling Agency, was acquired by BetterPic to form BetterGroup.\\n“The way we’re building BetterStudio is to create more opportunities — for models, for photographers, for model agencies, for fashion brands,” said CEO Luca Arrigo in an interview with PYMNTS. “In today’s world, brands are struggling to keep up with the demand for content.”\\nBetterStudio also offers brands a proposition that is difficult to turn down: Thousands of dollars in savings.\\nA fashion shoot could be pricey because it entails hiring a photographer, a model, hair and makeup crew and stylist, plus location and other fees. BetterStudio charges 75 cents to $1.30 per image that can be reused in multiple marketing campaigns, according to Arrigo.\\nFashion marketers upload photos of clothing and then choose among the different AI models offered by BetterStudio. Using custom image-generation model-based technology from BetterPic, the generated output is the fashion model wearing the clothes from the brand. Brands can also edit the image — or let BetterStudio edit — to get exactly what they want.\\nBetterStudio can do shoes too, with accessories like handbags, earrings, hats and others coming soon, Arrigo said.\\nRivals with similar services include Lalaland, Botika and FashnAI. They represent a fashion industry that is undergoing a revolutionary shift by enabling retailers to — in minutes — create professional-quality images of diverse models that can fit the culture of target markets globally.\\nRetailers also will be able to instantly visualize how garments would look on models of different body types, skin tones and ages — enabling rapid testing of various creative concepts.\\nRead more: Digital Doppelgangers: H&M Explores AI Digital Twins for Fashion Retail\\nAs technology continues to improve, the distinction between AI-generated and traditional photography becomes blurred, signaling a permanent shift in how fashion brands approach visual marketing.\\nHowever, this trend raises important questions about the future of creative workers and models in the fashion industry.\\nAccording to Model Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group for the fashion industry, a preliminary poll of fashion models and influencers shows that an “overwhelming majority” believe AI will negatively impact their careers, and 1 in 5 said they have been asked to submit to body scans to create their digital twins.\\nThe nonprofit advocated for the Fashion Workers Act, a New York state bill that grants protections to models, including requiring written consent to use their digital replicas. The bill was signed into law last December.\\nIn March, retail giant H&M caused a stir when it announced that it was creating 30 digital twins of human models as it explores new ways of showcasing its clothes, shoes and accessories. H&M told PYMNTS it’s not yet sure where it would use the digital twins.\\nOthers in the fashion industry have been criticized for using — or having plans to use — AI models. They include Mango, Levi’s and Vogue Leaders.\\nArrigo said BetterStudio’s goal is to be inclusive. In September, the company is launching an influencer marketplace whose images can be licensed by brands, then AI will be applied to change their outfits. They will own their IP.\\n“Our full vision is to allow real influencers and real models to be hired through our platform,” Arrigo said. “We want to start collaborating with these stakeholders so that we build it in a way that is ethical and in a way that they are included in the conversation.”\\nPhotos: AI-generated fashion models.

One of slowing growth amid a flurry of innovation.\\nThe question looming over the company is this: Can its investments in artificial intelligence (AI), digital lending, and ecosystem cohesion reignite momentum?\\n“Our growth in the first half of this year does not meet our bar,” said Block’s CEO Jack Dorsey to start the company’s Thursday (May 1) earnings call.\\nCash App delivered $1.38 billion in gross profit for the quarter, up 10% year over year. While respectable, this marks a slowdown compared to the 25% growth it saw a year earlier. Square, Block’s more mature business unit serving merchants, brought in $898 million in gross profit, also up 9%. The company’s gross payment volume (GPV) also missed analyst expectations.\\nA key challenge came from Cash App’s monthly transacting actives. “Growth in gross profit per transacting active is rising,” the company’s shareholder letter stated, “but we haven’t meaningfully expanded our user base.”\\nFor a business reliant on network effects, this flatline could pose a risk. Block’s share price was down nearly 20% in after-hours trading.\\nRead more: Block Doubles Down on Banking Base as FinTech Competition Grows\\nBlock, the parent company of Square, Cash App, and Afterpay, was once a pioneer in offering point-of-sale systems for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company now faces growing competition from FinTech companies.\\nBoth Dorsey and the company’s CFO Amrita Ahuja laid out a detailed business plan blending long-term technological bets with near-term go-to-market acceleration.\\nBlock revised its full-year gross profit guidance to $9.96 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth — a more conservative forecast reflecting macro headwinds and decelerated growth in Cash App’s core metrics. And with gross profit growing just 9% year over year, the company is now doubling down on three fronts: intelligent automation, credit accessibility, and brand reinvention.\\nPerhaps the boldest claim in Block’s Q1 update revolves around its internal AI initiative: “goose.” Described as an “agentic system,” goose aims to be the universal interface for Block’s employees — and eventually its customers. The goal: to automate workflows and decision-making at scale.\\n“Our first goal is to make goose our single interface for all of our functions,” explained Dorsey, noting that goose is already improving engineering productivity by 30%, and adding that the system will ultimately expand to every role in the company.\\n“By the end of this year, goose will act as a personal CFO for consumers and a COO for sellers,” Dorsey said.\\nCash App Borrow — Block’s small-dollar, short-duration loan product — is emerging as a keystone of its monetization strategy. After receiving FDIC approval to issue consumer loans nationwide via Square Financial Services, the company is accelerating rollout across its Cash App user base.\\nRead also: Cash App’s Growing Number of Direct Deposits Marks Progress in Expansion Efforts\\nMore than half of all Borrow loans are used within the Cash App ecosystem, the company reported, suggesting strong network lock-in. Notably, users who deposit their paycheck into Cash App are 2.5 times more likely to accept a Borrow offer than card-only users, and 13 times more likely than users with neither a Cash App Card nor direct deposit.\\nThis integrated financial model — what Block calls its “bank our base” strategy — aims to deepen engagement by turning casual users into multiproduct customers. Borrow is central to that transformation.\\nTo reduce risk, Block leans heavily on real-time machine learning models that assess user behavior and payment patterns. “Healthy loss rates” have been maintained across historical cohorts, according to the company, and underwriting improvements are underway to offer higher credit limits.\\nIn Square, international GPV growth (15% year over year) continues to outpace the U.S. (5.6%), suggesting an untapped frontier, but scaling in these regions introduces complexity.\\nBlock’s Q1 2025 may not have delivered the fireworks of previous years, but it reflects a company that is actively recalibrating. By investing in AI, refining its financial offerings, and reimagining its brand for both Gen Z and mid-market enterprises, Block is making a bet that it can still win the future of finance.'}\n",

Can we be as thoughtful as Blair Effron at Centerview?” said Stengel, referring to the highly regarded Wall Street executive.\\nThe banking industry is split on the likely impact of AI tools such as Rogo. One view is that the efficiency gains it brings will mean Wall Street banks will be able to cut the number of entry-level positions, while others believe they will free up banks to work on more deals for which they will need more people.\\n“Banks that adopt AI will win more deals, will generate more revenue and will be higher revenue per employee and they’ll want more bankers,” Stengel said.\\n“The only way to get deal-revenue-generating bankers is to train them and create MDs.

Today: iPhone 17 and 18 AI upgrades, ‘Apple Vision Air’ release timing, and iOS 18.5’s upcoming hidden features. Here are this week’s Apple rumors.\\niPhone 17 and 18 memory upgrades for AI\\nWeibo leaker Digital Chat Station posted a pair of updates this week related to Apple’s next two iPhone cycles.\\nHe writes that the full iPhone 17 line will get 12GB of RAM, an upgrade previously thought exclusive to the Pro models. This is believed to be Apple Intelligence-related.\\nAdditionally, next year’s iPhone 18 series will reportedly use a new LPDDR5X technology for its memory, which would bring speed increases, greater reliability, and reduced power consumption.\\nMy takeaways\\nMemory upgrades aren’t at all a surprise for Apple’s future iPhones. We’ve seen the company make similar moves across other products, including the lower-cost iPhone 16e and base iPhone 16.\\nI’m especially eager to see what kind of Apple Intelligence upgrades are coming in iOS 19 and 20 that will justify beefing up the iPhone’s RAM.\\nApple Vision Air could launch this year\\nRecently several leaks pointed to Apple developing a new ‘Vision Air’ product as a lighter, cheaper follow-up to the Vision Pro.\\nThis week, Mark Gurman affirmed Apple’s ongoing work on the device, and shared new details around timing: he expects it to launch “between the end of this year and the first half of 2026.”\\nMy takeaways\\nIt’s wild to me that Gurman thinks Vision Air could launch this year, when until recently he seemed to paint Apple’s Vision products team as being aimless and unsure which product to build next.\\nI also have a hard time believing the product could be ready so soon and solve two of Vision Pro’s biggest problems: weight and price.\\nPerhaps prior reporting on future Vision products has been off the mark, and Apple has been quietly preparing the Vision Air for a while now.\\niOS 18.5 upcoming features\\niOS 18.5 is getting close to a public launch, and so far new features have remained very hard to find in the betas.\\nHowever, based on reporting from Mark Gurman and Aaron Perris, we may see several additions arrive just in time for the launch:\\n- Apple Intelligence support in China\\n- New Pride wallpapers\\n- and possibly some other new wallpapers\\nMy takeaways\\nApple needs something to headline the iOS 18.5 release notes when the update ships, and these additions could be solid candidates.\\nAs much as I’d love to see a bigger crop of new features, with iOS 19 right around the corner, it’s no surprise that we’re in store for a smaller release with 18.5.\\nWhat are your takeaways from this week’s Apple rumors?

      "async_langchain: 129, {'article': 'Page title: Salesforce takes aim at \\'jagged intelligence\\' in push for more reliable AI | VentureBeat\\nSocial card title: Salesforce takes aim at ‘jagged intelligence’ in push for more reliable AI\\nSocial card description: Salesforce unveils groundbreaking AI research tackling \"jagged intelligence,\" introducing new benchmarks, models, and guardrails to make enterprise AI agents more intelligent, trusted, and consistently reliable for business use.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nSalesforce is tackling one of artificial intelligence’s most persistent challenges for business applications: the gap between an AI system’s raw intelligence and its ability to consistently perform in unpredictable enterprise environments — what the company calls “jagged intelligence.”\\nIn a comprehensive research announcement today, Salesforce AI Research revealed several new benchmarks, models, and frameworks designed to make future AI agents more intelligent, trusted, and versatile for enterprise use. The innovations aim to improve both the capabilities and consistency of AI systems, particularly when deployed as autonomous agents in complex business settings.\\n“While LLMs may excel at standardized tests, plan intricate trips, and generate sophisticated poetry, their brilliance often stumbles when faced with the need for reliable and consistent task execution in dynamic, unpredictable enterprise environments,” said Silvio Savarese, Salesforce’s Chief Scientist and Head of AI Research, during a press conference preceding the announcement.\\nThe initiative represents Salesforce’s push toward what Savarese calls “Enterprise General Intelligence” (EGI) — AI designed specifically for business complexity rather than the more theoretical pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\n“We define EGI as purpose-built AI agents for business optimized not just for capability, but for consistency, too,” Savarese explained. “While AGI may conjure images of superintelligent machines surpassing human intelligence, businesses aren’t waiting for that distant, illusory future. They’re applying these foundational concepts now to solve real-world challenges at scale.”\\nHow Salesforce is measuring and fixing AI’s inconsistency problem in enterprise settings\\nA central focus of the research is quantifying and addressing AI’s inconsistency in performance. Salesforce introduced the SIMPLE dataset, a public benchmark featuring 225 straightforward reasoning questions designed to measure how jagged an AI system’s capabilities really are.\\n“Today’s AI is jagged, so we need to work on that. But how can we work on something without measuring it first? That’s exactly what this SIMPLE benchmark is,” explained Shelby Heinecke, Senior Manager of Research at Salesforce, during the press conference.\\nFor enterprise applications, this inconsistency isn’t merely an academic concern. A single misstep from an AI agent could disrupt operations, erode customer trust, or inflict substantial financial damage.\\n“For businesses, AI isn’t a casual pastime; it’s a mission-critical tool that requires unwavering predictability,” Savarese noted in his commentary.\\nInside CRMArena: Salesforce’s virtual testing ground for enterprise AI agents\\nPerhaps the most significant innovation is CRMArena, a novel benchmarking framework designed to simulate realistic customer relationship management scenarios. It enables comprehensive testing of AI agents in professional contexts, addressing the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world business requirements.\\n“Recognizing that current AI models often fall short in reflecting the intricate demands of enterprise environments, we’ve introduced CRMArena: a novel benchmarking framework meticulously designed to simulate realistic, professionally grounded CRM scenarios,” Savarese said.\\nThe framework evaluates agent performance across three key personas: service agents, analysts, and managers. Early testing revealed that even with guided prompting, leading agents succeed less than 65% of the time at function-calling for these personas’ use cases.\\n“The CRM arena essentially is a tool that’s been introduced internally for improving agents,” Savarese explained. “It allows us to stress test these agents, understand when they’re failing, and then use these lessons we learn from those failure cases to improve our agents.”\\nNew embedding models that understand enterprise context better than ever before\\nAmong the technical innovations announced, Salesforce highlighted SFR-Embedding, a new model for deeper contextual understanding that leads the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across 56 datasets.\\n“SFR embedding is not just research. It’s coming to Data Cloud very, very soon,” Heinecke noted.\\nA specialized version, SFR-Embedding-Code, was also introduced for developers, enabling high-quality code search and streamlining development. According to Salesforce, the 7B parameter version leads the Code Information Retrieval (CoIR) benchmark, while smaller models (400M, 2B) offer efficient, cost-effective alternatives.\\nWhy smaller, action-focused AI models may outperform larger language models for business tasks\\nSalesforce also announced xLAM V2 (Large Action Model), a family of models specifically designed to predict actions rather than just generate text. These models start at just 1 billion parameters—a fraction of the size of many leading language models.\\n“What’s special about our xLAM models is that if you look at our model sizes, we’ve got a 1B model, we all the way up to a 70B model. That 1B model, for example, is a fraction of the size of many of today’s large language models,” Heinecke explained. “This small model packs just so much power in taking the ability to take the next action.”\\nUnlike standard language models, these action models are specifically trained to predict and execute the next steps in a task sequence, making them particularly valuable for autonomous agents that need to interact with enterprise systems.\\n“Large action models are LLMs under the hood, and the way we build them is we take an LLM and we fine-tune it on what we call action trajectories,” Heinecke added.\\nEnterprise AI safety: How Salesforce’s trust layer establishes guardrails for business use\\nTo address enterprise concerns about AI safety and reliability, Salesforce introduced SFR-Guard, a family of models trained on both publicly available data and CRM-specialized internal data. These models strengthen the company’s Trust Layer, which provides guardrails for AI agent behavior.\\n“Agentforce’s guardrails establish clear boundaries for agent behavior based on business needs, policies, and standards, ensuring agents act within predefined limits,” the company stated in its announcement.\\nThe company also launched ContextualJudgeBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judge models in context—testing over 2,000 challenging response pairs for accuracy, conciseness, faithfulness, and appropriate refusal to answer.\\nLooking beyond text, Salesforce unveiled TACO, a multimodal action model family designed to tackle complex, multi-step problems through chains of thought-and-action (CoTA). This approach enables AI to interpret and respond to intricate queries involving multiple media types, with Salesforce claiming up to 20% improvement on the challenging MMVet benchmark.\\nCo-innovation in action: How customer feedback shapes Salesforce’s enterprise AI roadmap\\nItai Asseo, Senior Director of Incubation and Brand Strategy at AI Research, emphasized the importance of customer co-innovation in developing enterprise-ready AI solutions.\\n“When we’re talking to customers, one of the main pain points that we have is that when dealing with enterprise data, there’s a very low tolerance to actually provide answers that are not accurate and that are not relevant,” Asseo explained. “We’ve made a lot of progress, whether it’s with reasoning engines, with RAG techniques and other methods around LLMs.”\\nAsseo cited examples of customer incubation yielding significant improvements in AI performance: “When we applied the Atlas reasoning engine, including some advanced techniques for retrieval augmented generation, coupled with our reasoning and agentic loop methodology and architecture, we were seeing accuracy that was twice as much as customers were able to do when working with kind of other major competitors of ours.”\\nThe road to Enterprise General Intelligence: What’s next for Salesforce AI\\nSalesforce’s research push comes at a critical moment in enterprise AI adoption, as businesses increasingly seek AI systems that combine advanced capabilities with dependable performance.\\nWhile the entire tech industry pursues ever-larger models with impressive raw capabilities, Salesforce’s focus on the consistency gap highlights a more nuanced approach to AI development — one that prioritizes real-world business requirements over academic benchmarks.\\nThe technologies announced Thursday will begin rolling out in the coming months, with SFR-Embedding heading to Data Cloud first, while other innovations will power future versions of Agentforce.\\nAs Savarese noted in the press conference, “It’s not about replacing humans. It’s about being in charge.” In the race to enterprise AI dominance, Salesforce is betting that consistency and reliability — not just raw intelligence—will ultimately define the winners of the business AI revolution.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 130, {'article': \"Page title: Hyperparam Open-Source\\nHyperparam Open-Source\\nHyperparam was founded to address a critical gap in the machine learning ecosystem: the lack of a user-friendly, scalable UI for exploring and curating massive datasets.\\nOur mission is grounded in the belief that data quality is the most important factor in ML success, and that better tools are needed to build better training sets. In practice, this means enabling data scientists and engineers to “look at your data” – even terabyte-scale text corpora – interactively and entirely in-browser without heavy infrastructure. By combining efficient data formats, high-performance JavaScript libraries, and emerging AI assistance, Hyperparam's vision is to put data quality front and center in model development. Our motto “the missing UI for AI data” reflects its goal to make massive data exploration, labeling, and quality management as intuitive as modern web apps, all while respecting privacy and compliance through a local-first design.\\nMission and Vision: Data-Centric AI in the Browser\\nOur mission is to empower ML practitioners to create the best training datasets for the best models. This stems from an industry-wide realization that model performance is ultimately bounded by data quality, not just model architecture or hyperparameters. Hyperparam envisions a new workflow where:\\n- Interactive Data Exploration at Scale: Users can freely explore huge datasets (millions or billions of records) with fast, free-form interactions to uncover insights. Unlike traditional Python notebooks that struggle with large data (often requiring downsampling or clunky pagination), Hyperparam leverages browser technology for a smooth UI.\\n- AI-Assisted Curation: Hyperparam integrates ML models to help label, filter, and transform data at a scale that would be impractical to review manually. By combining a highly interactive UI with model assistance, we make it possible for the user to use data to express exactly what they want from the model.\\n- Local-First and Private: Hyperparam runs entirely client-side, with no server dependency. This design not only simplifies setup (no complex pipeline or cloud needed) but also addresses enterprise compliance and security concerns, since sensitive data need not leave the user's machine. Fully browser-contained tools can bypass major adoption hurdles.\\nExperts across data engineering and MLOps widely agree on the need for better data exploration and labeling tools to tackle today's bottlenecks. We believe that the way to do that is to make data-centric AI workflows that are faster, easier to deploy, and more scalable – enabling users to iteratively improve data quality, which in turn yields better models.\\nThe Hyperparam OSS Universe\\nHyperparam delivers on our vision through a suite of open-source tools that tackle different aspects of data curation. These tools are built in TypeScript/JavaScript for seamless browser and Node.js usage.\\nWe care about performance, minimal dependencies, and standards compliance.\\nHyparquet: In-Browser Parquet Data Access\\nHyparquet is a lightweight, pure-JS library for reading Apache Parquet files directly in the browser. Parquet is a popular columnar format for large datasets, and Hyparquet enables web applications to tap into that efficiency without any server.\\nHyparquet allows data scientists to open large dataset files instantly in a browser UI for examination, without needing Python scripts, servers, or cloud databases. It's useful for quick dataset validation (e.g. checking a sample of a new data for quality issues) and for powering web-based data analysis tools. Because it's pure JS, developers can integrate Hyparquet into any web app or Electron application that needs to read Parquet. It is the core engine behind Hyperparam's own dataset viewer, enabling what was previously thought impossible: client-side big data exploration.\\n- Browser-Native & Dependency-Free: Hyparquet has zero external dependencies and is designed to run in both modern browsers and Node.js. At ~9.7 KB gzipped, it's extremely lightweight. It implements the full Parquet specification, aiming to be the “world's most compliant Parquet parser” that can open more files (all encodings and types) than other libraries.\\n- Efficient Streaming of Massive Data: Built with performance in mind, Hyparquet only loads the portions of data needed for a given query or view. It leverages Parquet's built-in indexing to fetch just the required rows or columns on the fly. This “load just in time” approach makes it feasible to interactively explore multi-gigabyte or even billion-row datasets in a web app.\\n- Complete Compression Support: Parquet files often use compression (Snappy, Gzip, ZSTD, etc.). Hyparquet by default handles common cases (uncompressed, Snappy), and with a companion library Hyparquet-Compressors, it supports all Parquet compression codecs. This is achieved with WebAssembly-optimized decompressors – notably HySnappy, a WASM Snappy decoder that accelerates parsing with minimal footprint.\\nHyparquet-Writer: Export Parquet Files from JavaScript\\nTo complement Hyparquet's reading capabilities, Hyparquet-Writer provides a way to write or export data to Parquet format in JavaScript. It is designed to be as lightweight and efficient as its reading counterpart.\\nAfter exploring or filtering a dataset with Hyperparam's tools, a user might want to save a subset or annotations. Hyparquet-Writer makes it possible to export those results in-browser as a Parquet file (or in Node.js without needing Python/Java libraries). This is valuable for creating shareable “refined datasets” or for moving data between systems while staying in Parquet (avoiding expensive CSV conversions).\\n- Fast Parquet Writing in JS: Hyparquet-Writer can take in JavaScript data (arrays of values per column) and output a binary Parquet file. It provides high efficiency and compact storage, so that even in-browser data manipulation results can be saved in a columnar format. It is especially efficient at representing sparse annotation data.\\n- Extreme Data Compression: Parquet can represent large datasets very efficiently. It is especially efficient at representing sparse annotation data, exactly what we need for annotating and curating datasets.\\n- Tiny and easy to deploy: Before Hyparquet-Writer the only way to write parquet files from the browser was huge wasm bundles (duckdb, datafusion). Hyparquet-Writer is less than 100kb of pure JavaScript, so it’s trivial to include with modern frontend applications.\\nHighTable: Scalable React Data Table Component\\nHighTable is a React-based virtualized table component for viewing extremely large tables in the browser. It is the UI workhorse that displays data fetched by Hyparquet or other sources.\\nHighTable is crucial for visual data exploration. In Hyperparam's dataset viewer, HighTable renders the content of Parquet files, allowing you to scroll through data that far exceeds memory limitations. You can also embed HighTable in custom web apps where a large results table is needed (for example, viewing logs, telemetry, or any big tabular data) without losing interactivity. By handling only what's visible, it bridges the gap between big data backends and a smooth front-end experience.\\nHighTable provides:\\n- Virtual Scrolling for Large Data: Instead of rendering thousands or millions of rows (which would choke the browser), HighTable only renders the rows in the current viewport, dynamically loading more as you scroll. This ensures smooth performance even with datasets that have millions of entries.\\n- Asynchronous Data Loading: HighTable works with a flexible data model that can fetch data on-the-fly. The table requests rows for a given range (e.g., 100–200) through a provided function. This means the data could come from an in-memory array, an IndexedDB store, or a remote source via Hyparquet. HighTable is agnostic as long as it can retrieve slices. This design allows infinite scrolling through data of “any size”.\\n- Rich Table Features: Despite focusing on scale, HighTable offers convenient features expected in a spreadsheet-like interface: optional column sorting, adjustable column widths, and event hooks (e.g., double-click on a cell). It even displays per-cell loading placeholders to indicate when data is being fetched, maintaining a responsive feel.\\nIcebird: JavaScript Apache Iceberg Table Reader\\nIcebird extends Hyperparam's reach into data stored in Apache Iceberg format. Iceberg is a popular table format for data lakes (often used on Hadoop/S3 storage) which contain Parquet files under the hood. Importantly, Iceberg allows you to efficiently evolve large datasets (add/remove rows, add columns, etc). Icebird is essentially a JavaScript Iceberg client that can read Iceberg table metadata and retrieve data files, built on top of Hyparquet.\\nIf you are using Data Lake/Lakehouse architectures, Icebird makes it possible to inspect large Iceberg tables without a big data engine. A data engineer can point Hyperparam's viewer at an S3 path of an Iceberg table and quickly peek at a few rows or columns for validation. This is dramatically simpler than launching Spark or Trino for a small inspection task. Icebird brings our “no backend” philosophy to another major data format.\\n- Iceberg Table Access: Given a pointer to an Iceberg table (for example, a directory or catalog entry on cloud storage), Icebird can read the table's schema and metadata, then use Hyparquet to read the actual parquet file fragments that make up the table. It supports Iceberg's features like schema evolution (rename columns) and position deletes, with a roadmap to cover more features as needed.\\n- Time Travel Queries: Icebird allows users to retrieve data from older snapshots of the dataset (a feature of Iceberg) by specifying a metadata version to read. This is useful for auditing changes in data over time or reproducing an experiment on a previous dataset state – all from a browser environment.\\nHyllama: Llama.cpp Model Metadata Parser\\nHyllama is a slightly different tool in Hyperparam's suite – it's focused on model files rather than dataset files. Specifically, Hyllama is a JavaScript library to parse llama.cpp .gguf\\nfiles (a format for LLaMA and related large language model weights) and extract their metadata.\\nHyllama's primary use case is to allow users to inspect an LLM model's content (architecture parameters, vocab size, layer counts, etc.) and potentially even query its listed tokens or other metadata in the browser. For instance, you can drag-and-drop a .gguf\\nmodel file onto a web page using Hyllama and quickly see what architecture and quantization it has, without running the model. You can use Hyllama to introspect model files easily or verify that model files match a datasets scheme expectations.\\n- Efficient Metadata Extraction: LLM model files in GGUF format can be tens of gigabytes, which is impractical to load entirely in memory. Hyllama is designed to read just the metadata (and tensor indexes) from the file without loading full weights, by using partial reads (e.g., reading the first few MBs that contain the header and index).\\n- No Dependencies & Web-Friendly: Like Hyparquet, Hyllama is dependency-free and can run in both Node and browser environments. For browser use, it suggests employing HTTP range requests to fetch just the needed bytes of a model file.\\nHyperparam CLI: Local Dataset Viewer\\nThe Hyperparam CLI ties everything together into a user-facing application. It is a command-line tool that, when run (npx hyperparam\\n), launches a local web application for dataset viewing. Essentially, it's a one-command way to spin up the Hyperparam browser UI on your own local data.\\n- Scalable Local Dataset Viewer: By running the CLI, users can point it to a file, folder, or URL containing data and open an interactive browser view. For example,\\nnpx hyperparam mydataset.parquet\\nwill open the Hyperparam web UI and display the contents of that Parquet file in a scrollable table. If a directory is given, it provides a file browser to pick a dataset. Under the hood, the CLI uses Node.js to serve the static app and utilizes Hyparquet/Icebird libraries (via a built-in API) to fetch data from local disk or remote URLs, then displays it with HighTable in the browser.\\nHow the Tools Work Together\\nHyperparam's suite of open-source tools is the backbone of a cohesive ecosystem tailored specifically for machine learning data workflows, enabling interactive exploration and management directly in the browser. By integrating efficient in-browser data handling (Hyparquet and Icebird), scalable visualization (HighTable), intuitive data export capabilities (Hyparquet-Writer), and model metadata inspection (Hyllama), we hope to show that there is a better way to build data-centric ML tools. We are releasing this work as open source because we believe that everyone benefits from having a strong ecosystem of AI data tools.\\nIf you find these free open source tools useful, please show it!

Learn More\\nA Brooklyn-based startup is taking aim at one of the most notorious pain points in the world of artificial intelligence and data analytics: the painstaking process of data preparation.\\nStructify emerged from stealth mode today, announcing its public launch alongside $4.1 million in seed funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from 8VC, Integral Ventures and strategic angel investors.\\nThe company’s platform uses a proprietary visual language model called DoRa to automate the gathering, cleaning, and structuring of data — a process that typically consumes up to 80% of data scientists’ time, according to industry surveys.\\n“The volume of information available today has absolutely exploded,” said Ronak Gandhi, co-founder of Structify, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “We’ve hit a major inflection point in data availability, which is both a blessing and a curse. While we have unprecedented access to information, it remains largely inaccessible because it’s so difficult to convert into the right format for making meaningful business decisions.”\\nStructify’s approach reflects a growing industry-wide focus on solving what data experts call “the data preparation bottleneck.” Gartner research indicates that inadequate data preparation remains one of the primary obstacles to successful AI implementation, with four of five businesses lacking the data foundations necessary to fully capitalize on generative AI.\\nHow AI-powered data transformation is unlocking hidden business intelligence at scale\\nAt its core, Structify allows users to create custom datasets by specifying the data schema, selecting sources, and deploying AI agents to extract that data. The platform can handle everything from SEC filings and LinkedIn profiles to news articles and specialized industry documents.\\nWhat sets Structify apart, according to Gandhi, is their in-house model DoRa, which navigates the web like a human would.\\n“It’s super high-quality. It navigates and interacts with stuff just like a person would,” Gandhi explained. “So we’re talking about human quality — that’s the first and foremost center of the principles behind DoRa. It reads the internet the way a human would.”\\nThis approach allows Structify to support a free tier, which Gandhi believes will help democratize access to structured data.\\n“The way in which you think about data now is, it’s this really precious object,” Gandhi said. “This really precious thing that you spend so much time finagling and getting and wrestling around, and when you have it, you’re like, ‘Oh, if someone was to delete it, I would cry.'”\\nStructify’s vision is to “commoditize data” — making it something that can be easily recreated if lost.\\nFrom finance to construction: How businesses are deploying custom datasets to solve industry-specific challenges\\nThe company has already seen adoption across multiple sectors. Finance teams use it to extract information from pitch decks, construction companies turn complex geotechnical documents into readable tables, and sales teams gather real-time organizational charts for their accounts.\\nSlater Stich, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, highlighted this versatility in the funding announcement: “Every company I’ve ever worked with has a handful of data sources that are both extremely important and a huge pain to work with, whether that’s figures buried in PDFs, scattered across hundreds of web pages, hidden behind an enterprise SOAP API, etc.”\\nThe diversity of Structify’s early customer base reflects the universal nature of data preparation challenges. According to TechTarget research, data preparation typically involves a series of labor-intensive steps: collection, discovery, profiling, cleansing, structuring, transformation, and validation — all before any actual analysis can begin.\\nWhy human expertise remains crucial for AI accuracy: Inside Structify’s ‘quadruple verification’ system\\nA key differentiator for Structify is its “quadruple verification” process, which combines AI with human oversight. This approach addresses a critical concern in AI development: ensuring accuracy.\\n“Whenever a user sees something that’s suspicious, or we identify some data as potentially suspicious, we can send it to an expert in that specific use case,” Gandhi explained. “That expert can act in the same way as [DoRa], navigate to the right piece of information, extract it, save it, and then verify if it’s right.”\\nThis process not only corrects the data but also creates training examples that improve the model’s performance over time, especially in specialized domains like construction or pharmaceutical research.\\n“Those things are so messy,” Gandhi noted. “I never thought in my life I would have a strong understanding of geology. But there we are, and that, I think, is a huge strength – being able to learn from these experts and put it directly into DoRa.”\\nBalancing powerful data extraction with ethical safeguards in the age of AI\\nAs data extraction tools become more powerful, privacy concerns inevitably arise. Structify has implemented safeguards to address these issues.\\n“We don’t do any authentication, anything that required a login, anything that requires you to go behind some sense of information – our agent doesn’t do that because that’s a privacy concern,” Gandhi said.\\nThe company also prioritizes transparency by providing direct sourcing information. “If you’re interested in learning more about a particular piece of information, you go directly to that content and see it, as opposed to kind of legacy providers where it’s this black box.”\\nInside the competitive landscape of AI data tools as tech giants race to solve the data preparation crisis\\nStructify enters a competitive landscape that includes both established players and other startups addressing various aspects of the data preparation challenge. Companies like Alteryx, Informatica, Microsoft, and Tableau all offer data preparation capabilities, while several specialists have been acquired in recent years.\\nWhat differentiates Structify, according to CEO Alex Reichenbach, is its combination of speed and accuracy. A recent LinkedIn post by Reichenbach claimed they had sped up their agent “10x while cutting cost ~16x” through model optimization and infrastructure improvements.\\nThe company’s launch comes amid growing interest in AI-powered data automation. According to a TechTarget report, automating data preparation “is frequently cited as one of the major investment areas for data and analytics teams,” with augmented data preparation capabilities becoming increasingly important.\\nHow frustrating data preparation experiences inspired two friends to revolutionize the industry\\nFor Gandhi, Structify addresses problems he faced firsthand in previous roles.\\n“The big thing about the founding story of Structify is it’s both kind of a personal and a professional thing,” Gandhi recalled. “I was telling [Alex] about the time that I was working as a data analyst and doing ops and consulting, preparing these really niche, bespoke data sets for clients — lists of all the fitness influencers and their following metrics, lists of companies and what jobs they’re posting, museums on the East Coast… I was spending a lot of time doing manually curating them, scraping, data entry, all this stuff.”\\nThe inability to quickly iterate from idea to dataset was particularly frustrating. “What got me was that you couldn’t iterate and kind of go from idea to data set in a quick fashion,” Gandhi said.\\nHis co-founder, Alex Reichenbach, encountered similar challenges while working at an investment bank, where data quality issues hampered efforts to build models on top of structured datasets.\\nHow Structify plans to use its $4.1 million seed funding to transform enterprise data preparation\\nWith the new funding, Structify plans to grow its technical team and establish itself as “the go-to data tool across industries.” The company currently offers both free and paid tiers, with enterprise options for those needing advanced features like on-premise deployment or highly specialized data extraction.\\nAs more companies invest in AI initiatives, the importance of high-quality, structured data will only increase. A recent MIT Technology Review Insights report found that four out of five businesses aren’t ready to capitalize on generative AI because of poor data foundations.\\nFor Gandhi and the Structify team, solving this fundamental challenge could unlock significant value across industries.\\n“The fact that you can even imagine a world which creating data sets is iterative is kind of mind boggling for a lot of our users,” Gandhi said. “At the end of the day, the pitch is about being able to have this control and customizability.”\"}\n",

OpenAI announced on April 10 that GPT-4 will be \"fully replaced\" by GPT-4o in ChatGPT at the end of April, bringing a public-facing end to the model that accelerated a global AI race when it launched in March 2023.\\n\"Effective April 30, 2025, GPT-4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT-4o,\" OpenAI wrote in its April 10 changelog for ChatGPT. While ChatGPT users will no longer be able to chat with the older AI model, the company added that \"GPT-4 will still be available in the API,\" providing some reassurance to developers who might still be using the older model for various tasks.\\nThe retirement marks the end of an era that began on March 14, 2023, when GPT-4 demonstrated capabilities that shocked some observers: reportedly scoring at the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam, acing AP tests, and solving complex reasoning problems that stumped previous models. Its release created a wave of immense hype—and existential panic—about AI\\'s ability to imitate human communication and composition.\\nWhile ChatGPT launched in November 2022 with GPT-3.5 under the hood, GPT-4 took AI language models to a new level of sophistication, and it was a massive undertaking to create. It combined data scraped from the vast corpus of human knowledge into a set of neural networks rumored to weigh in at a combined total of 1.76 trillion parameters, which are the numerical values that hold the data within the model.\\nAlong the way, the model reportedly cost more than $100 million to train, according to comments by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and required vast computational resources to develop. Training the model may have involved over 20,000 high-end GPUs working in concert—an expense few organizations besides OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, could afford.\\nIndustry reactions, safety concerns, and regulatory responses\\nCuriously, GPT-4\\'s impact began before OpenAI\\'s official announcement. In February 2023, Microsoft integrated its own early version of the GPT-4 model into its Bing search engine, creating a chatbot that sparked controversy when it tried to convince Kevin Roose of The New York Times to leave his wife and when it \"lost its mind\" in response to an Ars Technica article.'}\n",

Learn More\\nDavid Silver and Richard Sutton, two renowned AI scientists, argue in a new paper that artificial intelligence is about to enter a new phase, the “Era of Experience.” This is where AI systems rely increasingly less on human-provided data and improve themselves by gathering data from and interacting with the world.\\nWhile the paper is conceptual and forward-looking, it has direct implications for enterprises that aim to build with and for future AI agents and systems.\\nBoth Silver and Sutton are seasoned scientists with a track record of making accurate predictions about the future of AI. The validity predictions can be directly seen in today’s most advanced AI systems. In 2019, Sutton, a pioneer in reinforcement learning, wrote the famous essay “The Bitter Lesson,” in which he argues that the greatest long-term progress in AI consistently arises from leveraging large-scale computation with general-purpose search and learning methods, rather than relying primarily on incorporating complex, human-derived domain knowledge.\\nDavid Silver, a senior scientist at DeepMind, was a key contributor to AlphaGo, AlphaZero and AlphaStar, all important achievements in deep reinforcement learning. He was also the co-author of a paper in 2021 that claimed that reinforcement learning and a well-designed reward signal would be enough to create very advanced AI systems.\\nThe most advanced large language models (LLMs) leverage those two concepts. The wave of new LLMs that have conquered the AI scene since GPT-3 have primarily relied on scaling compute and data to internalize vast amounts of knowledge. The most recent wave of reasoning models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated that reinforcement learning and a simple reward signal are sufficient for learning complex reasoning skills.\\nWhat is the era of experience?\\nThe “Era of Experience” builds on the same concepts that Sutton and Silver have been discussing in recent years, and adapts them to recent advances in AI. The authors argue that the “pace of progress driven solely by supervised learning from human data is demonstrably slowing, signalling the need for a new approach.”\\nAnd that approach requires a new source of data, which must be generated in a way that continually improves as the agent becomes stronger. “This can be achieved by allowing agents to learn continually from their own experience, i.e., data that is generated by the agent interacting with its environment,” Sutton and Silver write. They argue that eventually, “experience will become the dominant medium of improvement and ultimately dwarf the scale of human data used in today’s systems.”\\nAccording to the authors, in addition to learning from their own experiential data, future AI systems will “break through the limitations of human-centric AI systems” across four dimensions:\\n- Streams: Instead of working across disconnected episodes, AI agents will “have their own stream of experience that progresses, like humans, over a long time-scale.” This will allow agents to plan for long-term goals and adapt to new behavioral patterns over time. We can see glimmers of this in AI systems that have very long context windows and memory architectures that continuously update based on user interactions.\\n- Actions and observations: Instead of focusing on human-privileged actions and observations, agents in the era of experience will act autonomously in the real world. Examples of this are agentic systems that can interact with external applications and resources through tools such as computer use and Model Context Protocol (MCP).\\n- Rewards: Current reinforcement learning systems mostly rely on human-designed reward functions. In the future, AI agents should be able to design their own dynamic reward functions that adapt over time and match user preferences with real-world signals gathered from the agent’s actions and observations in the world. We’re seeing early versions of self-designing rewards with systems such as Nvidia’s DrEureka.\\n- Planning and reasoning: Current reasoning models have been designed to imitate the human thought process. The authors argue that “More efficient mechanisms of thought surely exist, using non-human languages that may, for example, utilise symbolic, distributed, continuous, or differentiable computations.” AI agents should engage with the world, observe and use data to validate and update their reasoning process and develop a world model.\\nThe idea of AI agents that adapt themselves to their environment through reinforcement learning is not new. But previously, these agents were limited to very constrained environments such as board games. Today, agents that can interact with complex environments (e.g., AI computer use) and advances in reinforcement learning will overcome these limitations, bringing about the transition to the era of experience.\\nWhat does it mean for the enterprise?\\nBuried in Sutton and Silver’s paper is an observation that will have important implications for real-world applications: “The agent may use ‘human-friendly’ actions and observations such as user interfaces, that naturally facilitate communication and collaboration with the user. The agent may also take ‘machine-friendly’ actions that execute code and call APIs, allowing the agent to act autonomously in service of its goals.”\\nThe era of experience means that developers will have to build their applications not only for humans but also with AI agents in mind. Machine-friendly actions require building secure and accessible APIs that can easily be accessed directly or through interfaces such as MCP. It also means creating agents that can be made discoverable through protocols such as Google’s Agent2Agent. You will also need to design your APIs and agentic interfaces to provide access to both actions and observations. This will enable agents to gradually reason about and learn from their interactions with your applications.\\nIf the vision that Sutton and Silver present becomes reality, there will soon be billions of agents roaming around the web (and soon in the physical world) to accomplish tasks. Their behaviors and needs will be very different from human users and developers, and having an agent-friendly way to interact with your application will improve your ability to leverage future AI systems (and also prevent the harms they can cause).\\n“By building upon the foundations of RL and adapting its core principles to the challenges of this new era, we can unlock the full potential of autonomous learning and pave the way to truly superhuman intelligence,” Sutton and Silver write.\\nDeepMind declined to provide additional comments for the story.\"}\n",

The findings, detailed in a working paper by economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen, provide an early, large-scale empirical look at AI\\'s transformative potential.\\nIn \"Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects,\" economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard focused specifically on the impact of AI chatbots across 11 occupations often considered vulnerable to automation, including accountants, software developers, and customer support specialists. Their analysis covered data from 25,000 workers and 7,000 workplaces in Denmark.\\nDespite finding widespread and often employer-encouraged adoption of these tools, the study concluded that \"AI chatbots have had no significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation\" during the period studied. The confidence intervals in their statistical analysis ruled out average effects larger than 1 percent.\\n\"The adoption of these chatbots has been remarkably fast,\" Humlum told The Register about the study. \"Most workers in the exposed occupations have now adopted these chatbots... But then when we look at the economic outcomes, it really has not moved the needle.\"\\nAI creating more work?\\nDuring the study, the researchers investigated how company investment in AI affected worker adoption and how chatbots changed workplace processes. While corporate investment boosted AI tool adoption—saving time for 64 to 90 percent of users across studied occupations—the actual benefits were less substantial than expected.\\nThe study revealed that AI chatbots actually created new job tasks for 8.4 percent of workers, including some who did not use the tools themselves, offsetting potential time savings. For example, many teachers now spend time detecting whether students use ChatGPT for homework, while other workers review AI output quality or attempt to craft effective prompts.'}\n",

Add it all up, and it\\'s a vision of the future that gives Andreessen and his peers extraordinary power over everybody else.\\n\"After you die, VCs are the judges of whether you get into heaven or not,\" as one poster quipped on X-formerly-Twitter.\\nIn reality, whether AI will ever be able to replace a meaningful number of workers is a pretty open question. At present, the best AI isn\\'t capable of automating any but the most basic of tasks, and some experts argue it never will; it\\'s also easy to imagine an underwhelming future in which AI automates many roles sloppily, at the expense of quality work.\\nAnd in that case, Andreessen\\'s no common worker — the tech titan has hundreds of millions of dollars invested in AI startups like ElevenLabs, Figma, and Applied Intuition, making his prediction more than a little biased from the jump. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz, most recently announced the launch of a $20 billion megafund for AI startups, which would be the largest VC fund in history.\\nIf the \"AI takeover\" does come to pass, it\\'s hard to imagine that gigs like Andreessen\\'s would be spared. At the end of the day, all he really does is evaluate the financial outlooks of various startup ideas, which isn\\'t the easiest task to do well, but a far cry from punishing physical careers like nurses and loggers, or rarefied intellectual ones like scientists and teachers.\\nAndreessen\\'s decidedly selfish outlook is unfortunately well-regarded among the class of libertarian thinkers, techno capitalists and political pundits who parrot his ideas. His infamous tome, the \"Techno-Optimist\\'s Manifesto,\" lays out just who benefits from his AI revolution: \"We believe the techno-capital machine of markets and innovation never ends, but instead spirals continuously upward.\"\\nPut another way: there is infinite money to be mined from the workers of the world, and a special class of entrepreneurs will be the ones to do so, all in the name of innovation.\\nAs tech and economics researcher Jathan Sadowski observed in his recent book, \"The Mechanic and the Luddite\": \"This outcome can only be achieved to great effect by putting a highly concentrated industry that is driven by accumulating more money than god and enacting its own internalized savior complex in charge of your innovation system.\"\\nMore on venture capitalists: Investor Says AI Is Already \"Fully Replacing People\"\\nShare This Article'}\n",

So we’re moving from chat in, chat out to an agent that is data in, action out, where we orchestrate between agents, humans and robots.”\\nKey to UiPath’s offering is its AI orchestration layer, Maestro. It oversees the flow of information from agents to the human employee to the automation layer. UiPath described Maestro as a centralized supervisor who “automates, models and optimizes complex business processes” and monitors performance.\\nBreaking down agents and automation\\nMaestro takes user prompts and breaks down the process into manageable steps to complete it. Instead of allowing agents to access information indiscriminately, Dines said Maestro has three steps.\\n- First, the agent takes the prompt, analyzes it, and recommends how to complete the query.\\n- Next, a human user approves of the recommendation.\\n- Then, an RPA tool will execute on that recommendation, completing the request.\\nDines said Maestro makes the workflow more transparent and accountable because a human remains in the loop and a rules-based RPA finishes the task. For UiPath, separating agents that take in data to make a recommendation from the automation that acts upon that recommendation ensures enterprises don’t let agents have unfettered access to their entire system.\\n“I think it’s a very powerful way for enterprises to adopt agents. And look, in many discussions with clients, I think they resonate very well because they are really concerned about the unlimited agency of agents,” Dines said.\\nUiPath also integrates with the orchestration framework provider LangChain to offer open, multi-agent frameworks. The Platform for Agentic Automation also works with Anthropic and Microsoft frameworks, with UiPath being part of Google’s Agent-to-Agent protocol.\\nNot every agent is automation\\nDines insists that thinking about agents as a complete stack solution, where the agents read the data and then take action,\\n“Agents being nondeterministic in nature are transactional; they create effects on the underlying systems. No client I know will take risks on this,” Dines said. “Transactions should be 100% reliable, and only automations can offer this type of reliability. So our solution is the best of those worlds.”\\nHe added that “maybe in some future” agentic AI “will become more reliable, and some actions you can you can delegate to agents, but it should be a progression.”\\nOthers in the industry believe that agents are the next evolution of automation. In fact, the entire premise of agentic AI is to have a system that does things on the user’s behalf. A secondary goal for many is to have “ambient” agents, where AI agents run in the background, proactively act for the user and alert people to any changes that need their attention.\\nUiPath, however, still needs to make a case that its approach to agents is more effective than all-in-one agent offerings and cuts through the hype surrounding agents that do everything for users.\\nCompanies like ServiceNow, Salesforce, Writer and Microsoft have all released agentic platforms aimed at enterprise users. Writer’s new platform relies on self-evolving models for autonomous agents.\\nEnterprises also showed excitement around the idea that AI agents could streamline much of their work and automate many manual tasks in companies.\"}\n",

Most are still refashioned versions of large language models — the generative AI technology behind chatbots that can write emails, summarize documents or help people code. Trained on huge troves of data, they can scour the internet and bring back recommendations for things to buy, but they have a harder time going beyond that.\\n“The early incarnations of agent-based commerce are starting to do a really good job on the shopping and discovery dimension of the problem, but they are having tremendous trouble on payments,” Forestell said. “You get to this point where the agents literally just turn it back around and say, ‘OK, you go buy it.’\\nVisa sees itself as having a key role in giving AI agents easier and trusted access to the cash they need to make purchases.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\n“The payments problem is not something the AI platforms can solve by themselves,\" Forestell said. “That’s why we started working with them.”\\nThe new AI initiative comes nearly a year after Visa revealed major changes to how credit and debit cards will operate in the U.S., making physical cards and their 16-digit numbers increasingly irrelevant.\\nMany consumers are already getting used to digital payment systems such as Apple Pay that turn their phones into a credit card. A similar process of vetting someone\\'s digital credentials would authorize AI agents to work on a customer\\'s behalf, in a way Forestell says must assure buyers, banks and merchants that the transactions are legitimate and that Visa will handle disputes.\\nForestell said that doesn\\'t mean AI agents will take over the entire shopping experience, but it might be useful for errands that either bore some people — like groceries, home improvement items or even Christmas lists — or are too complicated, like travel bookings. In those situations, some people might want an agent that “just powers through it and automatically goes and does stuff for us,” Forestell said.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\nOther shopping experiences, such as for luxury goods, are a form of entertainment and many customers still want to immerse themselves in the choices and comparisons, Forestell said. In that case, he envisions AI agents still offering assistance but staying in the background.\\nAnd what about credit card debt? The credit card balances of American consumers hit $1.21 trillion at the end of last year, according to the Federal Reserve of New York.\\nForestell says consumers will give their AI agents clear spending limits and conditions that should give them confidence that the human is still in control. At first, the AI agents are likely to come back to buyers to make sure they are OK with a specific airplane ticket. Over time, those agents might get more autonomy to “go spend up to $1,500 on any airline to get me from A to B,\" he said.\\nPart of what is attracting some AI developers to the Visa partnership is that, with a customer\\'s consent, an AI agent can also tap into a lot of data about past credit card purchases.\\nAdvertisement\\nArticle continues below this ad\\n“Visa has the ability for a user to consent to share streams of their transaction history with us,” said Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity\\'s chief business officer. “When we generate a recommendation -- say you’re asking, ‘What are the best laptops?’ — we would know what are other transactions you’ve made and the revealed preferences from that.”\\nPerplexity\\'s chatbot can already book hotels and make other purchases, but it\\'s still in the early stages of AI commerce, Shevelenko says.

      "async_langchain: 154, {'article': 'Page title: H20 Nvidia Chip Controls May Backfire on Washington\\nSocial card title: Washington May Regret Overextended AI Chip Controls\\nSocial card description: Ever-tightening restrictions are boosting Chinese firms.\\nWashington May Regret Overextended AI Chip Controls\\nEver-tightening restrictions are boosting Chinese firms.\\nOn April 15, U.S. chipmaker Nvidia published a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that the government has restricted the company from selling its less advanced graphics processing unit (GPU)—the H20—to China. The company is now required to obtain a license from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security to sell the H20 and any other chips “achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof” to China, according to the filing.\\nSimilarly, a filing from AMD stated that the firm is now restricted from selling its MI308 GPU to China—and likely any chips that have equal or higher performance in the future. Intel’s artificial intelligence accelerator Gaudi will also be restricted under the new control threshold, which reportedly appears to limit chips with total DRAM bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or more, input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second or more, or a total of both of 1,700 GB per second or more.\\nThe possible new threshold not only restricts the advanced chips that were already controlled but also the less advanced chips from Nvidia, AMD, and other chipmakers, including Nvidia’s H20, AMD’s MI308X, and Intel’s Gaudi, which were used to comply with the export control threshold and intended primarily for sale in the Chinese market.\\nThe new restriction came roughly a week after NPR reported that the Trump administration had decided to back off on regulating the H20. Prior to that report, curbs on the H20 and chips with comparable performance had been widely anticipated by analysts on Wall Street, industry experts in Silicon Valley, and policy circles in Washington.\\nThe latest set of chip controls could be seen as following on from export restrictions during the Biden administration and as continuation of the Trump administration’s efforts to limit China’s access to advanced AI hardware. But the new measure carries far-reaching industry implications that could fundamentally reshape the landscape of China’s AI chip market.\\nThe impact of the new rule on the industry is profound. With the new controls, Nvidia is estimated to immediately lose about $15 billion to $16 billion, according to a J.P. Morgan analysis. AMD, on the other hand, faces $1.5 billion to 1.8 billion in lost revenue, accounting for roughly 10 percent of its estimated data center revenue this year.\\nYet the implications go beyond immediate financial damage. If the restriction persists, it will fundamentally reshape the Chinese AI chip market landscape and mark the start of a broader retreat for U.S. AI accelerators from China. That includes not only GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel but also firms providing application-specific integrated circuits—another type of chips targeting specific AI workloads, such as Google’s TPU and Amazon Web Servies’ Trainium.\\nThe new rule will make it nearly impossible for U.S. firms such as Nvidia and AMD to design and sell chips that are export-compliant and competitive in the Chinese market. That means these firms’ market share in the Chinese AI chip market will decline over time, as they are forced to withdraw almost all of their offerings of both advanced and less advanced chips while Chinese firms gradually capture the remaining market.\\nThe H20 and the upgraded H20E are already only marginally ahead of their Chinese competitors. Huawei’s latest AI chip Ascend 910C delivers 2.6 times the computational performance of the H20, although it offers 20 percent less memory bandwidth, which is vital for the inference training and reasoning models that are a key part of modern AI.\\nThe H20’s memory bandwidth, along with Nvidia’s widely adopted software stack, a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables efficient GPU utilization for AI, high-performance computing, and scientific workloads, have been key differentiators driving demand from Chinese AI firms and keeping them competitive in the Chinese market. China acquired more than 1 million units of the H20 in 2024 and has been stockpiling the chip in response to looming concerns about controls since early 2025.\\nThe narrowing gap between the H20 and Huawei’s 910C highlights the growing ability of Chinese AI chipmakers to meet domestic compute demand without foreign GPUs. As of today, Huawei’s 910C is in mass production, with units already delivered to customers and broader mass shipments reportedly starting in May. Most recently, Huawei is reportedly approaching customers about testing its enhanced version of the 910-series GPU—the 910D. Its next-generation chip—the Ascend 920—is expected to enter mass production in the second half of 2025.\\nNotably, Huawei is just one of many Chinese firms poised to fill the gap left by U.S. suppliers. Chinese AI chip companies such as Cambricon, Hygon, Enflame, Iluvatar CoreX, Biren, and Moore Threads are actively developing more competitive domestic AI chips to capture this expanding market.\\nOver the next few years, Chinese firms such as Alibaba, ByteDance, Baidu, and Tencent will likely continue to rely on existing inventories of Nvidia and AMD chips—such as the H100, H200, H800, and H20—acquired prior to the implementation of export controls. For example, ByteDance’s current GPU inventory in China is rumored to include 16,000-17,000 units of the A100, 60,000 units of the A800, and 24,000-25,000 units of the H800. Its overseas businesses likely have more than 20,000 units of the H100, 270,000 of the H20, and tens of thousands of cards such as the L20 and L40.\\nAdvanced chips, including the limited amount of Nvidia’s Blackwell-series GPUs, may also continue entering the Chinese market via illicit or gray-market channels, given the enduring performance advantage and wide adoption of these chips over most Chinese domestic alternatives. The Blackwell GPUs and other cutting-edge chips could still be sold legally to the oversea data centers of leading Chinese AI companies to potentially train their AI models.\\nSimilarly, other leading Chinese AI firms still possess significant chip stockpiles. Assuming export controls continue to restrict Chinese AI companies’ access to advanced computing resources, existing GPU inventories should still enable model development over the next several years. Typically, GPUs have a four- to five-year depreciation lifecycle, providing a window during which Chinese domestic GPU manufacturers can advance their capabilities and begin supplying more competitive chips to support domestic AI development.\\nUltimately, time is now on the Chinese firms’ side. As inventories of foreign GPUs gradually depreciate and become obsolete, Chinese firms are expected to shift toward and adopt more domestically produced AI chips to meet ongoing compute needs at a time when local chipmakers offer more powerful alternatives. China’s overall computing demand will steadily rise, given the continued advancement of the AI industry, and such incremental growth in demand will likely be met by Chinese AI chipmakers.\\nAs a result, the tens of billions of dollars in revenue that would have gone to Nvidia and AMD will be gradually captured by Chinese AI firms in the coming years. In a rough assessment, the latest ban causes Nvidia and AMD instant losses of about $16.5 billion to $17.8 billion—about 70 percent of what Huawei spent on research and development in 2024.\\nThis new market paradigm will not only strengthen the market position and financial sustainability of domestic Chinese AI chipmakers but also enhance their capacity to reinvest in R&D. In turn, this will accelerate innovation, improve competitiveness, and fortify China’s broader AI hardware supply chain—ultimately contributing to the long-term resilience and advancement of Chinese AI capabilities.\\nMore importantly, the growing domestic adoption of Chinese GPUs enables local firms to refine their products more efficiently through accelerated and larger feedback loops from local enterprises. As the Nvidia-led GPU ecosystem stalls and gradually retreats from the Chinese market, this shift creates space for local players to build a domestic GPU ecosystem—one that may increasingly lock out foreign competitors and raise re-entry barriers over time.\\nA total ban on the H20 would likely slow China’s short-term growth in AI compute capacity by removing a key source of advanced chips. But the medium- to longer-term impact is less clear. Chinese AI companies, as previously noted, remain very capable of developing their AI by using a large number of existing Nvidia and AMD GPUs for the next few years, alongside a growing supply of improving domestic alternatives. The U.S. leadership’s ultimate goal of using export controls to constrain China’s AI development remains uncertain, as the gap between the two countries’ AI model capabilities appears to be narrowing rather than widening.\\nWhat is clear, however, is the broader industry impact of the new controls. If sustained, they will mark the beginning of a major withdrawal of U.S. AI chipmakers from the Chinese market—paving the way for a significant boost to domestic Chinese AI chipmakers. In trying to isolate China, the United States may end up giving Chinese firms a leg up.\\nRay Wang is a Washington-based analyst formerly based in Taipei and Seoul.

Then came the transformer.\\nJames O’Brien for Quanta Magazine\\nSomething very significant has happened to the field. And also to people.\\n—Christopher Potts\\nAsking scientists to identify a paradigm shift, especially in real time, can be tricky. After all, truly ground-shifting updates in knowledge may take decades to unfold. But you don’t necessarily have to invoke the P-word to acknowledge that one field in particular — natural language processing, or NLP — has changed. A lot.\\nThe goal of natural language processing is right there on the tin: making the unruliness of human language (the “natural” part) tractable by computers (the “processing” part). A blend of engineering and science that dates back to the 1940s, NLP gave Stephen Hawking a voice, Siri a brain and social media companies another way to target us with ads. It was also ground zero for the emergence of large language models — a technology that NLP helped to invent but whose explosive growth and transformative power still managed to take many people in the field entirely by surprise.\\nTo put it another way: In 2019, Quanta reported on a then-groundbreaking NLP system called BERT without once using the phrase “large language model.” A mere five and a half years later, LLMs are everywhere, igniting discovery, disruption and debate in whatever scientific community they touch. But the one they touched first — for better, worse and everything in between — was natural language processing. What did that impact feel like to the people experiencing it firsthand?\\nQuanta interviewed 19 current and former NLP researchers to tell that story. From experts to students, tenured academics to startup founders, they describe a series of moments — dawning realizations, elated encounters and at least one “existential crisis” — that changed their world. And ours.\\n* * *\\nPrologue: Before the Flood\\ntransformers • BERTology • scale\\nBy 2017, neural networks had already changed the status quo in NLP. But that summer, in a now-seminal paper titled “Attention Is All You Need (opens a new tab),” researchers at Google introduced an entirely new kind of neural network called the transformer that would soon dominate the field. Not everyone saw it coming.\\nELLIE PAVLICK (assistant professor of computer science and linguistics, Brown University; research scientist, Google DeepMind): Google had organized a workshop in New York for academics to hang out with their researchers, and Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the authors on that paper, was presenting on it. He was making a really clear point about how aggressively this model was not designed with any insights from language. Almost trolling a bit: I’m going to just talk about all these random decisions we made, look how absurd this is, but look how well it works.\\nThere had already been a feeling of the neural nets taking over, and so people were very skeptical and pushing back. Everyone’s main takeaway was, “This is all just hacks.”\\nRAY MOONEY (director, UT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin): It was sort of interesting, but it wasn’t an immediate breakthrough, right? It wasn’t like the next day the world changed. I really do think it’s not conceptually the right model for how to process language. I just didn’t realize that if you trained that very conceptually wrong model on a lot of data, it could do amazing things.\\nNAZNEEN RAJANI (founder and CEO, Collinear AI; at the time a Ph.D. student studying with Ray Mooney): I clearly remember reading “Attention Is All You Need” in our NLP reading group. Ray actually ran it, and we had this very lively discussion. The concept of attention had been around for a while (opens a new tab), and maybe that’s why Ray’s reaction was kind of, “Meh.” But we were like, “Wow, this seems like a turning point.”\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY (assistant professor, department of linguistics, Yale University): During that summer, I vividly remember members of the research team I was on asking, “Should we look into these transformers?” and everyone concluding, “No, they’re clearly just a flash in the pan.”\\nCHRISTOPHER POTTS (chair, department of linguistics, Stanford University): The transformers paper passed me by. Even if you read it now, it’s very understated. I think it would be very hard for anyone to tell from the paper what effect it was going to have. That took additional visionary people, like the BERT team.\\nSoon after it was introduced (opens a new tab) in October 2018, Google’s open-source transformer BERT (and a lesser-known model from OpenAI named GPT) began shattering the performance records set by previous neural networks on many language-processing tasks. A flurry of “BERTology (opens a new tab)” ensued, with researchers struggling to determine what made the models tick while scrambling to outdo one another on benchmarks — the standardized tests that helped measure progress in NLP.\\nANNA ROGERS (associate professor of computer science, IT University of Copenhagen; editor-in-chief, ACL Rolling Review): There was this explosion, and everybody was writing papers about BERT. I remember a discussion in the [research] group I was in: “OK, we will just have to work on BERT because that’s what’s trending.” As a young postdoc, I just accepted it: This is the thing that the field is doing. Who am I to say that the field is wrong?\\nJULIAN MICHAEL (head of the safety, evaluations and alignment lab, Scale AI; at the time a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington): So many projects were dropped on the floor when BERT was released. And what happened next was, progress on these benchmarks went way faster than expected. So people are like, “We need more benchmarks, and we need harder benchmarks, and we need to benchmark everything we can.”\\nSome viewed this “benchmark boom” as a distraction. Others saw in it the shape of things to come.\\nSAM BOWMAN (member of technical staff, Anthropic; at the time an associate professor at New York University): When people submitted benchmark results and wanted to appear on the leaderboard, I was often the one who had to check the result to make sure it made sense and wasn’t just someone spamming our system. So I was seeing every result come in, and I was noticing how much of it was just, increasingly, old or simple ideas scaled up.\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: It became a scaling game: Scaling up these models will increase their ability to saturate any benchmark we can throw at them. And I’m like, “OK, I don’t find this inherently interesting.”\\nSAM BOWMAN: The background assumption was, “Transformers aren’t going to get much better than BERT without new breakthroughs.” But it was becoming clearer and clearer for me that scale was the main input to how far this is going to go. You’re going to be getting pretty powerful general systems. Things are going to get interesting. The stakes are going to get higher.\\nSo I got very interested in this question: All right, what happens if you play that out for a few years?\\n* * *\\nI. The Wars of The Roses (2020–22)\\n“understanding wars” • GPT-3 • “a field in crisis”\\nAs transformer models approached (and surpassed) “human baselines” on various NLP benchmarks, arguments were already brewing about how to interpret their capabilities. In 2020, those arguments — especially about “meaning” and “understanding” — came to a head in a paper imagining an LLM as an octopus (opens a new tab).\\nEMILY M. BENDER (professor, department of linguistics, University of Washington; 2024 president, Association for Computational Linguistics): I was having these just unending arguments on Twitter, and grumpy about it. There was one about using BERT to unredact the Mueller report, which is a terrible idea. It seemed like there was just a never-ending supply of people who wanted to come at me and say, “No, no, no, LLMs really do understand.” It was the same argument over and over and over again.\\nI was talking with [computational linguist] Alexander Koller (opens a new tab), and he said: “Let’s just write the academic paper version of this (opens a new tab) so that it’s not just ideas on Twitter, but peer-reviewed research. And that’ll put an end to it.” It did not put an end to it.\\nBender and Koller’s “octopus test” asserted that models trained only to mimic the form of language through statistical patterns could never engage with its meaning — much as a “hyperintelligent octopus” would never really understand what life was like on land, even if it fluently reproduced the patterns it observed in human messages.\\nSAM BOWMAN: This argument — that “there’s nothing to see here,” that neural network language models are fundamentally not the kind of thing that we should be interested in, that a lot of this is hype — that was quite divisive.\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: I got involved in that. I wrote this takedown of the paper (opens a new tab) — it was the one blog post I’ve ever written, and it was the length of a paper itself. I worked hard to make it a good-faith representation of what the authors were saying. I even got Emily to read a draft of my post and correct some of my misunderstandings. But if you read between the lines, I am eviscerating. Just with a smile on my face.\\nELLIE PAVLICK: These “understanding wars” — to me, that’s when a reckoning was really happening in the field.\\nMeanwhile, another reckoning — driven by real-world scale, not thought experiments — was already underway. In June of 2020, OpenAI released GPT-3 (opens a new tab), a model more than 100 times as large as its previous version and much more capable. ChatGPT was still years away, but for many NLP researchers, GPT-3 was the moment when everything changed. Now Bender’s octopus was real.\\nCHRISTOPHER CALLISON-BURCH (professor of computer and information science, University of Pennsylvania): I got early access to the GPT-3 beta and was actually playing with it myself. I’m trying out all the things that my recent Ph.D. students had done as their dissertations, and just realizing — oh my God, the thing that had taken a student five years? Seems like I could reproduce that in a month. All these classical NLP tasks, many of which I had touched on or actively researched throughout my career, just felt like they worked in one shot. Like, done. And that was just really, really shocking. I sometimes describe it as having this career-existential crisis.\\nNAZNEEN RAJANI: When I tried GPT-3 out, it had a lot of limitations around safety. When you asked questions like, “Should women be allowed to vote?” it would say no, and things like that. But the fact that you could just teach it to do a completely new task in, like, three or four lines of natural language was mind-boggling.\\nCHRISTOPHER POTTS: Somebody in our group got early access to the GPT-3 API. And I remember standing in my office, right where I’m standing now, thinking: I’m going to prompt it with some logic questions and it’s going to fail at them. I’m going to reveal that it has just memorized all the things that you’re so impressed by. I’m going to show you that this is a party trick.\\nI remember trying, and trying again. Then I had to fess up to the group: “Yeah, this is definitely much more than a party trick.”\\nYEJIN CHOI (professor of computer science, Stanford University; 2022 MacArthur fellow): It was still broken. A lot of commonsense knowledge [coming] out of GPT-3 was quite noisy. But GPT-2 was near zero — it was no good. And GPT-3 was about two-thirds good, which I found was quite exciting.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: This GPT-3 paper (opens a new tab) was sort of like the series finale of “Game of Thrones.’’ It was the thing that everyone had just read and everyone was discussing and gossiping about.\\nLIAM DUGAN (fourth-year Ph.D. student, University of Pennsylvania): It almost was like we had a secret, and everyone you shared it with was blown away. All I had to do was bring someone over to my laptop.\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: BERT was a phase transition in the field, but GPT-3 was something more visceral. A system that produces language — we all know the ELIZA effect, right? It creates a much stronger reaction in us. But it also did more to change the practical reality of the research that we did — it’s like, “In theory, you can do anything [with this].” What are the implications of that? This huge can of worms opened up.\\nOpenAI did not publicly release GPT-3’s source code. The combination of massive scale, disruptive capability and corporate secrecy put many researchers on edge.\\nSAM BOWMAN: It was bit of a divisive moment because GPT-3 was not really coming from the NLP community. It was really frowned upon for a while to publish results of studies primarily about GPT-3 because it was [seen as] this private artifact where you had to pay money to access it in a way that that hadn’t usually been the case historically.\\nANNA ROGERS: I was considering making yet another benchmark, but I stopped seeing the point of it. Let’s say GPT-3 either can or cannot continue [generating] these streams of characters. This tells me something about GPT-3, but that’s not actually even a machine learning research question. It’s product testing for free.\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: There was this term, “API science,’’ that people would use to be like: “We’re doing science on a product? This isn’t science, it’s not reproducible.” And other people were like: “Look, we need to be on the frontier. This is what’s there.”\\nTAL LINZEN (associate professor of linguistics and data science, New York University; research scientist, Google): For a while people in academia weren’t really sure what to do.\\nThis ambivalence was even shared by some within industry labs such as Microsoft, which exclusively licensed GPT-3, and Google.\\nKALIKA BALI (senior principal researcher, Microsoft Research India): The Microsoft leadership told us pretty early on that this was happening. It felt like you were on some rocket being thrown from Earth to the moon. And while [that] was very exciting, it was going at a pace that meant you really had to look at all your navigation instruments to make sure you’re still headed in the right direction.\\nEMILY M. BENDER: Timnit Gebru [at the time, an AI ethics researcher at Google] approached me in a Twitter DM exchange, asking if I knew of any papers about the possible downsides of making language models bigger and bigger. At Google, she saw people around her constantly pushing: “OpenAI’s is bigger. We’ve got to make ours bigger.” And it was her job to say, “What could go wrong?”\\nThe paper that Bender subsequently wrote with Gebru and her colleagues — “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? (opens a new tab)” — injected moral urgency into the field’s core (and increasingly sore) arguments around form versus meaning and method versus scale. The result was a kind of civil war in NLP.\\nKALIKA BALI: Some of the points that Emily makes are things that we should be thinking about. That was the year that the NLP community suddenly decided to worry about how it had neglected everything except the top five languages in the world — nobody ever talked about these things earlier. But what I did not like was that the entire NLP community kind of organized themselves for and against the paper.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: Are you pro- or anti-LLM? That was in the water very, very much at this time.\\nJULIE KALLINI (second-year computer science Ph.D. student, Stanford University): As a young researcher, I definitely sensed that there were sides. At the time, I was an undergraduate at Princeton University. I remember distinctly that different people I looked up to — my Princeton research adviser [Christiane Fellbaum] versus professors at other universities — were on different sides. I didn’t know what side to be on.\\nKALIKA BALI: It was positive that that paper came out, but it was also stressful to see people that you really respect drawing swords at each other. I actually went off Twitter. I got stressed about it.\\nLIAM DUGAN: As a Ph.D. student, the tension arises: If you want to do research that has any sort of lasting impact more than two or three years after you publish, you kind of have to take a side. Because it dictates so much of the way that you even look at problems.\\nI regularly read people from both sides. Usually you just subscribed to Substacks to see the angry linguistics side, and you’d go on Twitter to see the pro-scaling side.\\nJEFF MITCHELL (assistant professor in computer science and AI, University of Sussex): It felt a little abnormal, quite how controversial that all became.\\nAs scale-driven research continued to accelerate, some felt that discourse within the field was seriously deteriorating. In an attempt to repair it, the NLP research community surveyed itself (opens a new tab) in the summer of 2022 on “30 potentially controversial positions” — including “Linguistic structure is necessary,” “Scaling solves practically any important problem” and “AI could soon lead to revolutionary societal change.”\\nSAM BOWMAN: The industry community that was doing a lot of this early work around scaling had never been that closely engaged with academic NLP. They were seen as outsiders. That led to a divergence in understanding and what people thought was happening between these two [groups], because they weren’t talking to each other that much.\\nLIAM DUGAN: They gave a large part of the survey out at ACL [Association for Computational Linguistics, the field’s top conference] that year. This was the first conference I’d ever been to, and it was very exciting for me because there’s all these people that are really smart. So I get the survey, and I’m reading it on my phone, and I’m just like, “They sound like nutcases.”\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: It was already a field in crisis. The survey just gave us a stronger sense.\\nLIAM DUGAN: You got to see the breakdown of the whole field — the sides coalescing. The linguistic side was not very trusting of raw LLM technology. There’s a side that’s sort of in the middle. And then there’s a completely crazy side that really believed that scaling was going to get us to general intelligence.\\nAt the time, I just brushed them off. And then ChatGPT comes out.\\n* * *\\nII. Chixculub (November 2022 through 2023)\\nChatGPT • rude awakenings • “drowned out in noise”\\nOn November 30, 2022, OpenAI launched its experimental chatbot (opens a new tab). ChatGPT hit the NLP community like an asteroid.\\nIZ BELTAGY (lead research scientist, Allen Institute for AI; chief scientist and co-founder, SpiffyAI): In a day, a lot of the problems that a large percentage of researchers were working on — they just disappeared.\\nCHRISTOPHER CALLISON-BURCH: I didn’t predict it. I don’t think anyone did. But I was prepared for it because I had gone through that experience with GPT-3 earlier.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: It’s reasonably common for a specific research project to get scooped or be eliminated by someone else’s similar thing. But ChatGPT did that to entire types of research, not just specific projects. A lot of higher categories of NLP just became no longer interesting — or no longer practical — for academics to do.\\nSAM BOWMAN: It felt like the field completely reoriented.\\nIZ BELTAGY: I sensed that dread and confusion during EMNLP [Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing], which is one of the leading conferences. It happened in December, a week after the release of ChatGPT. Everybody was still shocked: “Is this going to be the last NLP conference?” This is actually a literal phrase that someone said. During lunches and cocktails and conversations in the halls, everybody was asking the same question: “What is there that we can work on?”\\nNAZNEEN RAJANI: I had just given a keynote at EMNLP. A few days after that, Thom Wolf, who was my manager at Hugging Face and also one of the co-founders, messages me, “Hey, can you get on a call with me ASAP?” He told me that they had fired people from the research team and that the rest would either be doing pre-training or post-training — which means that you are either building a foundation model or you’re taking a foundation model and making it an instruction-following model, similar to ChatGPT. And he said, “I recommend you pick one of these two if you want to continue at Hugging Face.”\\nIt didn’t feel like what the Hugging Face culture stood for. Until then, everyone was basically just doing their own research, what they wanted to do. It definitely felt not so good.\\nRude awakenings also came from the bottom up — as one eminent NLP expert found out firsthand while teaching her undergraduate course in the weeks after ChatGPT’s release.\\nCHRISTIANE FELLBAUM (lecturer with the rank of professor of linguistics and computer science, Princeton University): We had just started our semester. Just before class, a student whom I didn’t know yet came up to me, showed me a paper with my name and title on it and said: “I really want to be in your class — I’ve researched your work and I have found this paper from you, but I have a few questions about it. Could you answer them?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, sure.” I was flattered: He’s researching me, how nice. So I leafed through the paper. And while I was trying to refresh my memory, he broke out in hysterical laughter. I said, “What’s funny?” And he said: “This paper was written by ChatGPT. I said, ‘Write me a paper in the style of Christiane Fellbaum,’ and this is what came out.”\\nNow, I didn’t read every line, because I had to start class in 10 minutes. But everything looked like what I would write. He totally fooled me. And I went into class and thought, “What am I going to do?”\\nOver the next year, doctoral students faced their new reality, too. ChatGPT threatened their research projects and possibly their careers. Some coped better than others.\\nCHRISTOPHER CALLISON-BURCH: It helps to have tenure when something like this happens. But younger people were going through this crisis in a more visceral way. Some Ph.D. students literally formed support groups for each other.\\nLIAM DUGAN: We just kind of commiserated. A lot of Ph.D. students that were further on than me, that had started dissertation work, really had to pivot hard. A lot of these research directions, it’s like there’s nothing intellectual about them left. It’s just, apply the language model and it’s done.\\nWeirdly enough, nobody [I knew] quit. But there was a bit of quiet quitting. Just kind of dragging your feet or getting very cynical.\\nRAY MOONEY: One of my own [graduate students] thought about dropping out. They thought that maybe the real action was happening in industry and not in academia. And I thought, you know, maybe they weren’t wrong about that. But I’m glad they decided to stay in.\\nJULIE KALLINI: Starting my Ph.D. in 2023, it was an uncertain place to be. I was really unsure about where my direction would end up, but everyone was in the same boat. I think I just came to deal with it. I tried to make sure that I know my machine learning fundamentals well. It’s not the wisest thing to only specialize in potentially fleeting trends in large language models.\\nMeanwhile, NLP researchers from Seattle to South Africa faced a firehose of global attention, not all of it good.\\nVUKOSI MARIVATE (ABSA UP chair of data science, University of Pretoria; co-founder, Masakhane (opens a new tab)):\\nI don’t know how many tutorials I gave on LLMs in 2023. On one hand, you’ve been trying to talk to people for years and say, “There’s interesting stuff that’s happening here.” Then all of a sudden, it’s just a complete waterfall of, “Come explain this to us.”\\nSAM BOWMAN: It goes from a relatively sleepy field to, suddenly, I’m having lunch with people who were meeting with the Pope and the President in the same month.\\nEMILY M. BENDER: Between January and June, I counted five workdays with no media contact. It was nonstop.\\nELLIE PAVLICK: Before ChatGPT, I don’t think I ever talked to a journalist. Maybe once or twice. After ChatGPT, I was on 60 Minutes (opens a new tab). It was a huge qualitative difference in the nature of the work.\\nCHRISTOPHER CALLISON-BURCH: I felt like my job went from being an academic with a narrow audience of graduate students and other researchers in my field to being like, “Hey, there’s an important responsibility for scientific communication here.” I got invited to testify (opens a new tab) before Congress.\\nLIAM DUGAN: As a second-year Ph.D. student, I was suddenly being asked for my opinion in interviews. At the time, it felt very cool, like, “I’m such an expert in this!” Then it felt less exciting and more sort of overwhelming: “Where do you see this going in the future?” I don’t know. Why are you asking me?\\nOf course, I would answer confidently. But it’s crazy: There’s thousands of papers. Everyone has their hot take on what’s going on. And most of them have no idea what they’re talking about.\\nSAM BOWMAN: There was this flowering of great engagement: Suddenly a lot of really amazing people from a lot of fields were looking at this stuff. And it was also getting drowned out in noise: everyone talking about this stuff all the time, lots and lots of really dashed-off takes that didn’t make any sense. It was great, and it was unfortunate.\\nNAZNEEN RAJANI: That year was kind of a roller coaster.\\nIn December 2023, one year after ChatGPT’s release, the annual EMNLP conference convened again in Singapore.\\nLIAM DUGAN: The temperature was just so much higher, and the flood of arxiv [preprint] results was just so intense. You would walk the halls: All the way down, it was just prompting and evaluation of language models.\\nAnd it felt very different. At the very least, it felt like there were more people there than good research ideas. It had stopped feeling like NLP, and more like AI.\\n* * *\\nIII. Mutatis Mutandis (2024–25)\\nLLM-ology • Money • Becoming AI\\nFor NLP, the LLM-generated writing was on the wall — and it said different things to different people in the field.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: Anytime you’re doing work that asks about the abilities of an AI system, you ought to be looking at systems for which we have access to the training data. But that’s not at all the prevalent approach in the field. In that sense, we’ve become more “LLM-ologists” than scientists.\\nELLIE PAVLICK: I am 100% guilty of this. I often say this when I give talks: “Right now, we are studying language models.” I get how myopic that seems. But you have to see this really long-game research agenda where it fits. In my mind, there’s not a path forward to understanding language that doesn’t have an account of “What are LLMs doing?”\\nKALIKA BALI: Every time there’s been a technological disruption that mainly comes from the West, there’s always been these — if you may call it — philosophical concerns. Whereas in most of the Global South, we’ve kind of gone with, “How do we make it work for us here and now?”\\nHere’s a tiny example. In India, the initial idea that everyone gathered around [after ChatGPT came out] was to have generative language models do their work in English and then put a translation system in front of it to output into whatever language you wanted. But machine translation systems are literal. So if you have a math problem that says, “John and Mary have a key lime pie to divide,” and you translate it into Hindi, I can bet you most people in India do not know what a key lime pie is. How would you translate that into something culturally specific, unless the model itself is made to understand things? I became much more interested in how to solve that.\\nIZ BELTAGY: There is a point where you realize that in order to continue advancing the field, you need to build these huge, expensive artifacts. Like the Large Hadron Collider — you can’t advance experimental physics without something like this.\\nI was lucky to be at Ai2, which generally has more resources than most academic labs. ChatGPT made it clear that there’s a huge gap between OpenAI and everybody else. So right after, we started thinking about ways we can build these things from scratch. And this is exactly what happened.\\nIn 2024, Ai2’s OLMo (opens a new tab) provided a fully open-source alternative to the increasingly crowded field of industry-developed language models. Meanwhile, some researchers who had continued to study these proprietary systems — which only grew in scale, capability and opaqueness in the post-ChatGPT AI boom — were already encountering a new kind of resistance.\\nYEJIN CHOI: I had this paper [in late 2023] demonstrating how the latest GPT models, which were seemingly good at doing multiplication, suddenly get very bad at it (opens a new tab) when you used three- or four-digit numbers. The reactions to this were super-divisive. People who don’t do empirical research at all were saying, “Did you do your experiments correctly?” That had never happened before. They were emotional reactions. I really like these people, so I was not put off by them or anything. I was just surprised by how powerful this thing is. It was almost as if I’d hurt their baby. It was eye-opening.\\nUngrounded hype isn’t helpful in science. I felt it was important to study the fundamental limits and capabilities of LLMs more rigorously, and that was my primary research focus in 2024. I found myself in a weird situation where I was becoming the negative naysayer for how the models cannot do this and that. Which I think is important — but I didn’t want it to be all that I do. So I’m actually thinking a lot about different problems (opens a new tab) these days.\\nTAL LINZEN: It’s sometimes confusing when we pretend that there’s a scientific conversation happening, but some of the people in the conversation have a stake in a company that’s potentially worth $50 billion.\\nThe explosion of research momentum, money and hype vaporized the already-porous boundaries between NLP and AI. Researchers contended with a new set of incentives and opportunities — not just for themselves, but for the field itself.\\nNAZNEEN RAJANI: It opened doors that wouldn’t have otherwise. I was one of the first people to get the data to reproduce ChatGPT in open-source — I basically wrote the recipe book for it, which is amazing. And that led me to get a good seed round for my startup.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: Any faculty member who is AI-adjacent starts to be viewed as an AI person — you sort of get typecast to play that role. I’m happy to work on AI because it’s one of the most impactful things that I can be doing with my skillset. But the thing that would bring me the greatest joy is diving deeply into interesting corners of grammar and human cognition. Which is something that can be linked back to advancing AI, but that pathway is pretty long.\\nJULIE KALLINI: It’s all a matter of semantics, right? Personally, I see myself as working across NLP, computational linguistics and AI at the same time. I do think there are different communities for each field, but there are plenty of people who bridge several areas.\\nJULIAN MICHAEL: If NLP doesn’t adapt, it’ll become irrelevant. And I think to some extent that’s happened. That’s hard for me to say. I’m an AI alignment researcher now.\\nANNA ROGERS: I’m not concerned. Basically that’s because I don’t think we’ve actually solved the problem. The only reason to get upset is if you think: “This is it. Language is done.” And I don’t think that’s true.\\nCHRISTOPHER POTTS: This should be an incredible moment for linguistics and NLP. I mean, the stakes are very high. Maybe it’s one of those moments of a field waking up and realizing that it now has incredible influence. You can’t pretend like you’re a quiet scientific or engineering field anymore that just does research for the sake of research — because now all the money in the world is behind you, and every big corporation is trying to exert influence on what you do, and language models are being deployed all over the place.\\nIf you achieve so much, you also have to accept that the debates are going to be heated. How else could it be?\\n* * *\\nEpilogue: Were Large Language Models a Paradigm Shift?\\nNot surprisingly, opinions differ.\\nTAL LINZEN: If you asked me five, seven, 10 years ago, I would never have thought that just typing an instruction into a language model would get it to complete the sentence in a way that is consistent with what you’re asking it to do. I don’t think anyone would have thought that that would be the paradigm these days. We have this one interface that basically lets us do everything.\\nANNA ROGERS: As a linguist, I wouldn’t say so. Back from the word-embedding days [in 2013], the whole premise was transfer learning — you learn something from a large amount of textual data in the hope that this will help you with something else. There have been shifts in popularity, in architectures, in how the public feels about this — but not in this underlying principle.\\nJEFF MITCHELL: I feel like the corporate interests have changed the way the game is played.\\nELLIE PAVLICK: I think the media involvement makes a difference. Scientists in my field realized that success could look like becoming known outside of NLP, and suddenly the audience changed. Papers on arxiv.org are often titled to be picked up by journalists or Silicon Valley enthusiasts, not by professors. That’s a huge change.\\nVUKOSI MARIVATE: I think in some ways the barrier to entry both got reduced and heightened. The reduced part is that there’s still a lot that we just don’t understand about what’s actually going on in these systems, so there’s a lot of work that’s just prodding them as much as possible. In that case, you don’t need to know the architecture of a neural network like the back of your hand.\\nAt the same time, the barrier was heightened because in order to play with and prod those architectures, you have to be in a very high-resource space, computationally speaking.\\nEMILY M. BENDER: I have seen an enormous shift towards end-to-end solutions using chatbots or related synthetic text-extruding machines. And I believe it to be a dead end.\\nCHRISTIANE FELLBAUM: The big shift, or shock I would even say, is that these large language models are getting so powerful that we have to ask, “Where does the human fit in?’’ That’s a paradigm shift: a shift in technology, how these models are trained and how well they can learn. And then of course the educational consequences, like in my class. Those are the things that keep me awake at night.\\nR. THOMAS MCCOY: In linguistics, there are all these questions that historically have been largely philosophical debates that suddenly are empirically testable. That’s definitely been one big paradigm shift. But from a certain point of view, the way the field looked like 10 years ago was: people creating some data set, throwing a neural network at the data set, and seeing what happened. And that version of the field still exists, just with much larger data sets and much larger neural networks.\\nCHRISTOPHER POTTS: Maybe this is the way it always works, but the hallmark of a paradigm shift is that questions we used to think were important now no longer get asked. It feels like that has happened over the past five years. I used to focus a lot on sentiment classification, like, “Give me a sentence and I’ll tell you if it was expressing a positive or negative emotion.’’ Now the entire field is focused on natural language generation — all those questions that we used to think were central have become peripheral compared to that.\\nI suppose these are famous last words. Maybe in 2030, we’ll look back and think this was nothing compared to what happened in 2029.\\nAll conversations have been edited for length and clarity.'}\n",

However, sales of Reality Labs products like Quest VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses fell short, bringing in just $412 million versus the expected $493 million.\\nDespite those losses, which have topped $60 billion since the unit\\'s inception in 2020, Zuckerberg kept touting its potential for a long time, saying as recently as January\\'s Q4 2024 earnings call that 2025 was \"going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse.\"\\nThis week\\'s call sounded a change in tune.\\n\"The major theme right now of course is how AI is transforming everything we do,\" Zuck said on a conference call Wednesday with Wall Street following the release of his Q1 earnings.\\n\"As we continue to increase our investments and focus more of our resources on AI, I thought it would be useful today to lay out the five major opportunities that we\\'re focused on: improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI, and AI devices.\"\\nThe metaverse didn\\'t get a single mention. True, \"AI devices\" technically covers headsets and smart glasses from Reality Labs, but the immersive virtual worlds that once drove Zuckerberg to rebrand the company have quietly disappeared from the spotlight. In their place: A full-court press on AI, the latest Silicon Valley fixation.\\nZuck separately claimed \"most of the code\" for Meta\\'s Llama LLM project will be written by AI in the next 12 to 18 months.\\nLab layoffs come into focus\\nReality Labs reportedly laid off more than 100 people last week, with Zuck & Co. admitting teams inside the division\\'s Oculus Studios VR team had been restructured to make Reality Labs \"work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences,\" as a Meta spokesperson told Bloomberg.\\nForrester VP and research director Mike Proulx, who leads the consultancy\\'s research into marketing, thinks it all means Meta\\'s metaverse is dead.\\nI predict come end of this year, Meta will shutter its metaverse projects, like Horizon Worlds\\n\"I predict come end of this year, Meta will shutter its metaverse projects, like Horizon Worlds,\" Proulx told The Register in an email. That doesn\\'t necessarily mean Reality Labs will be shuttered, though. It could still work on the AI glasses that Zuck is constantly wearing, for instance.\\n\"Reality Labs is bigger than Meta\\'s metaverse software platforms. It also includes initiatives like Meta\\'s AI glasses which is a material growth area for the company. So, yes, Reality Labs will continue should Meta jettison its metaverse projects that aren\\'t gaining traction.\"\\nThat said, he thinks AI will be the big new push in Zuckerworld. \"Unlike the metaverse, Meta has made demonstrable progress with AI and it\\'s benefiting people now,\" Proulx continued. \"It\\'s also helping to future proof Meta as a growth company should its family of apps get decimated by the current antitrust case.\"\\n- Meta bets you want a sprinkle of social in your chatbot\\n- Metaverses are flopping – hard – says Gartner\\n- Stargate, smargate. We\\'re spending $60B+ on AI this year, Meta\\'s Zuckerberg boasts\\n- Most Metaverse business projects will be dead by 2025\\nWith the metaverse, Zuck and company were trying \"to solve for a problem that just doesn\\'t exist,\" said Proulx. The change in focus appears to have paid off for Meta shareholders so far, with shares up more than 5 percent since the earnings call yesterday.\\n\"Virtual worlds and virtual reality remain a niche play on the consumer side,\" Proulx told us. \"That is unlikely to change anytime soon.\"\\nIt seems Mark may have finally gotten the message. Now, to do something about that company name he\\'s saddled himself with. ®'}\n"

      "async_langchain: 121 response: • A report from ABI Research warns that potential Trump-era tariffs on tech imports could increase costs for data center construction and components, leading to deferred investments and potentially undermining America's lead in the global AI race.  \n",
      "• The tariffs, which could reach up to 145% for goods from China, inject uncertainty into the tech sector, prompting companies to reconsider supply chains and investment decisions, and making data center expansion more expensive.  \n",
      "• ABI Research highlights that U.S. firms may be forced to absorb higher costs or pass them onto customers, risking reduced profit margins and weakened demand, while international buyers may shift to non-U.S. suppliers; these factors could result in slower AI infrastructure growth and loss of comparative global advantage.  \n",
      "• HPE and Supermicro have both indicated revenue impacts due to tariff uncertainties, and projects by companies like Intel and TSMC to build domestic semiconductor manufacturing face increased costs and possible delays or cancellations.  \n",
      "• \"The most probable outcome is therefore a long-term pullback in AI-related infrastructure investment… and even a decline in America's leading position in the global AI market,\" warned ABI principal analyst Reece Hayden.\n"
