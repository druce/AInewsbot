    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhoutee score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process"

GPUs are in particular designed for problems where CPUs cannot achieve the desired throughput of mathematical operations (in particular, matrix multiplications).\\nBut GPUs are not cheap: high performance can command a high price.\\nCombined together, the high price, performance sensitivity, and throughput-orientation of GPU applications mean that a large number of engineers and technical leaders find themselves concerned with GPU utilization of some form or another — “we’re paying a lot, so we’d better be using what we’re paying for”.\\nAt Modal, we have our own GPU utilization challenges to solve and we help our users solve theirs. We’ve noticed that the term “GPU utilization” gets used to mean very different things by people solving problems at different parts of the stack. So we put together this article to share our framework for thinking about GPU utilization across the stack and the tips and tricks we’ve learned along the way.\\nIn particular, we’ll talk about three very different things that all get called “GPU utilization”:\\n- GPU Allocation Utilization, the fraction of your GPUs that are running application code,\\n- GPU Kernel Utilization, the fraction of time your application is running code on GPUs, and\\n- Model FLOP/s Utilization, the fraction of the GPUs’ theoretical arithmetic bandwidth your application is using to run models.\\nWe’ll specifically focus on neural network inference workloads — neural networks because they are workload generating the most demand right now and inference because, unlike training, inference is a revenue center not a cost center. We’re betting on the revenue center.\\nWhat is utilization?\\nUtilization = Output achieved ÷ Capacity paid for\\nUtilization relates the available capacity of a system to that system’s output.\\nIn throughput-oriented systems like GPU applications, the capacity paid for is often a bandwidth (e.g. the arithmetic bandwidth) and the output achieved is then a throughput (e.g. floating point operations per second, FLOP/s).\\nBecause it is a ratio, utilization is unitless. That means there are actually many GPU-related quantities you might call “GPU utilization”, leaving off the implicit units of the capacity and output. These different quantities range across orders of magnitude of time and across different organizational capacities (e.g. procurement, DevOps, and low-level performance engineering).\\nWhat is GPU Allocation Utilization?\\nGPU Allocation Utilization = GPU-seconds running application code ÷ GPU-seconds paid for\\nFirst, consider the number of GPUs that you have allocated — whether that is fixed GPU capacity on-premise in your basement (or data center) or it is rented capacity in a cloud data center (or many people’s basements) — across a period of time.\\nWe use the term GPU Allocation Utilization for the fraction of those GPU-seconds during which you were running application code. This is the highest-level notion of “GPU utilization”.\\nThere are two key limits on GPU Allocation Utilization: economic and developer-operational.\\nThe economic limits on GPU Allocation Utilization rise from combined technical and market limitations. Purchasing, commissioning, decomissioning, and selling GPUs cannot be done as quickly as the output demanded by the application changes (on the scale of seconds or minutes).\\nOf course, as for other hardware we are blessed with highly-virtualized data center platforms (“clouds”) where we can virtually allocate and de-allocate GPU capacity. Even there, however, existing pricing models and demand that exceeds supply leave providers dictating terms, like multi-month or multi-year commitments, which limit achievable utilization for a given quality-of-service.\\nWith a fixed, over-provisioned GPU allocation, utilization is low\\nModal helps organizations solve this problem. We aggregate GPU demand across consumers and GPU supply across providers to improve GPU allocation efficiency.\\nBut GPU Allocation Utilization isn’t just about the GPU-seconds paid for, it’s about the GPU-seconds spent running application code.\\nThat’s where the DevOps limits on GPU Allocation Utilization come in. Even in a fully liquid GPU market, there is latency between the time at which a GPU is purchased or rented and the time at which the GPU is running useful work — time to configure operating systems, perform health checks, copy over application code, etc. Absent the ability to precisely predict future demand at timescales greater than that latency, this leads to reduced GPU Allocation Utilization, reduced quality-of-service, or both!\\nIf allocation is slow, utilization and QoS suffer\\nTo achieve high GPU Allocation Utilization and meet quality-of-service goals, allocation and spin-up to application code needs to be fast enough to respond to increases in demand.\\nWith fast, automatic allocation, utilization and QoS can both be high\\nThis is one of the core problems solved by Modal. We manage a large multi-cloud GPU fleet, benefitting from economies of scale to unlock better engineering solutions and concentration of measure to improve predictability of demand. We built a custom container stack (in Rust btw) to reduce the latency from non-application code and system configuration. And users’ workloads spin up faster because the serverless runtime for that container execution system frames user workloads in terms of application code, not virtual machine maintenance. That allows us to skip the repetitive, undifferentiated work required to create virtual machines. That unlocks novel engineering optimizations for us, like memory snapshotting and restoration, and it just-so-happens to make application engineering easier for our users.\\nWhat level of GPU Allocation Utilization can I expect to achieve?\\nThe existing numbers are sobering. According to the State of AI Infrastructure at Scale 2024 report, the majority of organizations achieve less than 70% GPU Allocation Utilization when running at peak demand — to say nothing of aggregate utilization. This is true even of sophisticated players, like the former Banana serverless GPU platform, which operated at an aggregate utilization of around 20%.\\nWith Modal, users can achieve GPU Allocation Utilization in excess of 90% — in aggregate, not just at peak.\\nIf that interests you, check out our docs and our pricing page.\\nIf it doesn’t, read on for more about the software engineering required to get the most out of your GPUs — on Modal or elsewhere.\\nWhat is GPU Kernel Utilization?\\nGPU Kernel Utilization = GPU-seconds running kernels ÷ GPU-seconds paid for\\nJust because an allocated GPU is running application code doesn’t mean it is running code on the GPU. The term of art for “code that runs on the GPU” in the popular CUDA programming model for GPUs is “kernel”, and so we call the fraction of time we spend running code on the GPU the GPU Kernel Utilization.\\nThis utilization metric is reported by, among others, the beloved nvidia-smi\\ncommand line tool wrapping NVIDIA’s Management Library for their GPU hardware, and so it is commonly checked and cited. We expose it to our users under the name that library uses, “GPU utilization”. Note that this name can be slightly misleading, since this metric does not care whether the code we’re running on the GPU is exercising the hardware’s actual capacity.\\nAn application that is achieving low GPU Allocation Utilization is necessarily going to achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization, so long as you consider all GPU-seconds being paid for: a unit not running application code can’t run kernels.\\nWhy else might you achieve low GPU Kernel Utilization? In particular, what patterns will show up as low kernel utilization per GPU?\\nFirst, there might be lots of work to do that supports your application but doesn’t use the GPU, like moving input or output data via network or disk, downloading the many gigabytes of weights of a foundation model, or writing logs.\\nThese tasks can be sped up by usual means — judicious application of lazy and eager loading, parallelization, increased bandwidth for non-GPU components like networks, and deleting more code YAGN.\\nSecond, the CPU might not be providing work to the GPU quickly enough. A typical GPU-accelerated program is, like a high-performance network application, a dance of concurrency between the CPU executing logic about what work must be done and specialized, but dumb, hardware that can actually do the work. For example, when multiplying two matrices, the popular PyTorch library needs to determine the shapes and types of those two matrices and then lookup the appropriate kernel — somewhat akin to a JIT database query optimizer selecting a physical operator mid-execution. If you are unable to complete this work before the GPU finishes its previous task, the GPU will idle. We’ll call this class of issue “host overhead”.\\nOften, resolving host overhead is a matter of re-writing the host logic — preventing slow host work (like logging in Python) from blocking the host work that drives the GPU. But at the scale of milliseconds per task step, Python starts to become incapable of keeping up, and at the scale of microseconds per task step, the latency required to schedule kernels onto the GPU via the CUDA C++ APIs and driver begins to bottleneck.\\nIn both cases, there are two basic optimizations. First, multiple kernels can be launched at once using CUDA Graphs, which essentially convert a sequence of kernel launches into a DAG that only needs to be launched once. Second, the application can aggregate more work for the GPU to complete for a given unit of host work — for example by batching requests together — to improve utilization with a possible penalty to latency.\\nCode regions with low GPU Kernel Utilization can be identified from application traces, like those produced by the PyTorch Profiler. Specifically, any period of time where all CUDA streams are empty is a period of zero GPU Kernel Utilization, and so applications with low GPU Kernel Utilization have largely empty CUDA streams in their traces, like the one below. These periods of quiescence need to be correlated to activity on the host to determine which parts of the application code are leading to the bottleneck. GPU application profilers and trace viewers generally support this, e.g. by showing kernel launch dependencies, like the arrow in the trace below.\\nWhat level of GPU Kernel Utilization can I hope to achieve?\\nGPU Kernel Utilization is the closest metric in this article to the better-known CPU utilization. CPU utilization tracks the fraction of CPU cycles during which instructions were being executed on behalf of your program (as opposed to the CPU idling or running other programs).\\nHowever, for CPU utilization, hitting 90%+ is often bad, even a trigger for alerts. But we want to and can achieve that level of GPU Kernel Utilization!\\nFundamentally, this is downstream of the greater predictability of many GPU applications. Running a transactional database replica at 90% CPU utilization baseline risks degraded quality-of-service if query patterns or quantity change. Typical GPU applications have much less variability — for a database analogue, imagine repeatedly running only one basic sequential scan aggregation query, but with slightly different parameters each time — and so have more controllable quality-of-service.\\nWhat is Model FLOP/s Utilization (MFU)?\\nModel FLOP/s Utilization = Model FLOP/s throughput achieved ÷ FLOP/s bandwidth paid for\\nAt some galaxy-brained, CEO-math level, expenditures on GPUs are really expenditures on floating point operation bandwidth, and so the deepest and most fundamental utilization metric to measure is the ratio of that bandwidth to the throughput achieved.\\nThis metric is known as MFU, which either means “Maximum” or “Model” FLOP/s Utilization, depending on who you ask. We go with “Model”, since it’s more common.\\nInstances that aren’t running application code or that aren’t running GPU kernels cannot achieve a high MFU, so low GPU Allocation Utilization or low GPU Kernel Utilization imply low Model FLOP/s Utilization.\\nHowever, high utilization at these more abstract levels does not imply high MFU.\\nFirst, as an implementation detail, communication between GPUs is frequently implemented via GPU kernels. This communication, like most communication in distributed systems, is subject to faults (hardware fault, programmer fault, shark attack fault), which frequently manifest as deadlock. From the perspective of GPU Kernel Utilization, a system that is deadlocked in the middle of running a communication kernel is fully utilized (!), but it is completing no useful work. We like to catch this particular issue by monitoring GPU power draw and heat. More generally, optimizing communication is critical for achieving high MFU, especially for workloads that spread a single task across multiple nodes.\\nSecond, floating point computation is just one of the things a GPU must do to complete a task. The most important other task is moving data. Computation can only occur on data stored inside of the register file of the GPU’s streaming multiprocessors, which each store less than a megabyte, while foundation models are measured in gigabytes. The data to which a computation applies must generally be moved from a slower, larger area of the memory hierarchy. The bandwidth of this memory is generally many times lower than the device’s FLOP/s bandwidth, especially in recent generations. The ratio of an algorithm’s FLOP/s throughput to its byte/s throughput is called the arithmetic intensity.\\nBottlenecking on memory is a particular challenge in latency-sensitive foundation model inference workloads, where the arithmetic intensity is low (perhaps a few FLOPs per byte). Besides algorithmic rewrites to increase arithmetic intensity, like the online softmax in Flash Attention, the primary generic strategy is batching more work together, which increases FLOPs executed more than memory bytes moved for most neural network inference workloads, but generally adds per-task latency.\\nFinally, GPU kernels must be carefully written to achieve high MFU. This public worklog by Si Boehm gives a flavor for the effort required to reach state-of-the-art for a single kernel. Even that worklog stops short of truly maximizing MFU, since it tackles a problem that can’t make use of the fastest elements of contemporary GPUs, the Tensor Cores, and writing kernels that can saturate Tensor Cores is even more challenging — see this worklog from Pranjal Shankhdhar. For this reason, most teams use high-quality open source kernels through libraries like CuBLAS or frameworks like PyTorch and vLLM.\\nThe achieved FLOP/s and memory throughput of a GPU application can be monitored using the NVIDIA Data Center GPU Management tool, dcgm\\n. The metrics prefixed with DCGM_FI_PROF\\nare generally relevant. In particular, the DCGM_FI_PROF_DRAM_ACTIVE\\nmetric measures the utilization of the DRAM-to-SRAM memory bandwidth. The DCGM_FI_PROF_PIPE_TENSOR_ACTIVE\\nmetric measures the utilization of the Tensor Cores that provide the maximum FLOP/s bandwidth. This isn’t identical to MFU for subtle reasons covered well in Stas Bekman’s guide here.\\nWhat level of Model FLOP/s Utilization can I hope to achieve?\\nFirst, let’s note that measuring Model FLOP/s Utilization is tricky. The theoretical bandwidth can be read from manufacturer datasheets — but watch for asterisks like “with sparsity”. The achieved model throughput, on the other hand, can be hard to measure, in particular since some FLOPs might be spent on other computations, like activation recomputation in training. For that reason, it is often done based on pen-and-paper analysis of the algorithm and with approximate, “napkin” math.\\nThe state-of-the-art for MFU in training is achieved by the foundation model teams at leading organizations like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. Of these, Meta is the most open and reports an MFU of 38 - 41% when training the LLaMA 3 405B model. The more recent DeepSeek-v3 training run by DeepSeek achieved around 20-30% MFU (there’s no official number) using GPUs with tighter communication bottlenecks.\\nMuch of the shortfall is due to the need for inter-node communication in large training jobs, which creates bandwidth constraints that aren’t present in inference applications. For inference workloads, MFU might reach higher, closer to the 70% - 80% MFU achieved by raw matrix multiplications, but we aren’t aware of any published results from large-scale deployments. Let us know if we missed them!\\nFor context, it’s also helpful to consider the equivalent of MFU for a job running on a CPU. For concreteness, consider the One Billion Row Challenge, which led teams around the world to competitively optimize a large-scale aggregation problem on CPUs. This problem requires three floating point operations per row on one billion rows, and so has a total FLOP count of 3 billion. The leading results finished in about one second, and so achieved a FLOP/s throughput of about 3 billion. If we assume that the hardware used for the challenge, eight cores out of a 32 core AMD EPYC 7502P machine which can run at 3.35 GHz, is capable of issuing one FLOP per cycle, then the FLOP/s bandwidth is ~26 billion, for an MFU of ~10%. However, that CPU has AVX2 SIMD vector instructions with a lane width of 256 and so, assuming it can issue 16 FLOPs/cycle per core, the FLOP/s bandwidth is actually ~420 billion, leading to an MFU of under 1%.\\nHow can I improve my GPU utilization?\\nIf you’re not using Modal, that’s a great place to start! Especially for GPU Allocation Utilization.\\nBesides that, we recommend that if you want to improve your GPU utilization, you dive deeper into GPU-based computing.\\nWe wrote a GPU Glossary to collect together our definitions of the most important terms in one place, complete with links to some of our favorite resources for learning more. Try starting there!\\nAmong those resources, a few stand out, like this talk by Horace He, of the PyTorch team, and this dense blog post by Abhinav Upadhyay of Coding Confessions. We also highly recommend the ML Engineering Open Book by Stas Bekman for deep dives and useful snippets all across the stack.\\nWe’d like to thank Mark Saroufim of PyTorch & the GPU_MODE Discord (join it!) and Erik Dunteman of Pig for comments on a draft of this post.\"}\n",

      "async_langchain: 2, {'article': 'Page title: What\\'s the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT?\\nSocial card title: What\\'s the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT?\\nSocial card description: Very small compared to most of the other stuff you do.\\nWhat\\'s the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT?\\nVery small compared to most of the other stuff you do.\\nA couple of months ago I wrote an article looking at the energy use of artificial intelligence. Those numbers were focused on the macro picture: how much data centres and AI use on aggregate, for training, querying and everything else the world uses it for.\\nIt was not a guide on what this meant for individuals and how they use AI tools. But this is something that people want to know (and I have been asked about it many times).\\nMy sense is that a lot of climate-conscious people feel guilty about using ChatGPT. In fact it goes further: I think many people judge others for using it, because of the perceived environmental impact.\\nIf I’m being honest, for a while I also felt a bit guilty about using AI. The common rule-of-thumb is that ChatGPT uses 10 times as much energy as a Google search [I think this is probably now too high, but more on that later]. How, then, do I justify the far more energy-hungry option? Maybe I should limit myself to only using LLMs when I would really benefit from the more in-depth answer.\\nBut after looking at the data on individual use of LLMs, I have stopped worrying about it and I think you should too.\\nFor these analyses, I usually go back to the drawing board and crunch all of the numbers myself. But I recently stumbled upon several articles by another Substack writer, Andy Masley, who covered all of this in great detail. So, rather than repeating the entire exercise, I’d like to draw even more attention to these articles and ask you to go there for the in-depth story.\\nNow, I’m not sharing these articles blindly. I have checked the assumptions, and they rely on many of the heuristics that I would have used, too.\\nHere, instead, I want to give a brief summary of the results, my takeaways and what they mean for your use of ChatGPT. I’ll also look at the possibility that our current “best estimates” for its energy use are at least 10 times too high. That would make this argument — that personal use of ChatGPT is not that bad for the environment — even stronger.\\nEnergy footprint\\nThe key number in Andy’s analysis — and what you’d get from previous ChatGPT vs. Google search comparisons — is 3 Wh (Watt-hours). That’s the amount of electricity that’s used when you ask ChatGPT a question.\\nOn its own, that number is meaningless. So let’s give it some perspective.\\nThe UK generates around 4,500 kilowatt-hours (kWh) — or 4,500,000 Wh — of electricity per person per year, which covers all of our household, services, and domestic industrial activities.1 That means that one ChatGPT search is equal to 0.00007% of our annual per capita electricity footprint.\\nOr to put it another way: average electricity usage in the UK is 12,000 Wh per day. A ChatGPT prompt is 3 Wh. 3 Wh!\\nOf course, people don’t just use ChatGPT once. Let’s assume that you’re doing 10 searches per day. That would be equal to 0.2% of per capita electricity use. Ramp it up to 100 searches per day — which I expect very few people are doing — and it gets to around 2%.\\nElectricity use in the United States is about three times higher than in the UK, so ChatGPT prompts are an even smaller piece of the pie. Ten searches per day would come to 0.09% of per capita electricity generation, while 100 searches would be 0.9%.\\nUnless you’re an extreme power user, asking AI questions every day is still a rounding error on your total electricity footprint.\\nThe reason we often think that ChatGPT is an energy guzzler is because of the initial statement: it uses 10 times more energy than a Google search. Even if this is accurate, what’s missing is the context that a Google search uses a really tiny amount of energy. Even 10 times a really tiny number is still tiny.\\nCarbon footprint\\nWhat about your impact on the climate?\\nOf course, this question depends on how “clean” the electricity powering the data centres is.\\nSome of our best estimates are that one query emits around 2 to 3 grams of CO2. That includes the amortised emissions associated with training.\\nWe’ll take the higher number. If you did 10 searches every day for an entire year, your carbon footprint would increase by 11 kilograms of CO2.2 Let’s just be clear on how small 11 kilograms of CO2 is. The UK average footprint — just from energy and industry alone — is around 7 tonnes per person.3\\nThat means a moderate use of ChatGPT increases a Brit’s emissions by 0.16%. That’s similar to the percentages we saw for electricity consumption above.\\nFor the average American — who has a higher carbon footprint — it would be 0.07%.\\nTo illustrate this point, Andy Masley made the following chart (based on the original from Founders Pledge). It compares the tonnes of CO2 avoided from different behavioural changes, to asking ChatGPT 50,000 fewer questions (which is about 14 years’ worth of asking it 10 times a day, every day).\\nIt saves less than even the “small stuff” that we can do, like recycling, reusing plastic bags and replacing our lightbulbs. These are worth doing, by the way, but not at the expense of the big stuff like diet, cars, home heating, and flights, which can often save tonnes of CO2 a year. This is even more true for ChatGPT: if we’re fretting over a few queries a day while having a beef burger for dinner, heating our homes with a gas boiler, and driving a petrol car, we will get nowhere.\\nMaybe ChatGPT uses 10 times less energy than we think?\\nAll of the comparisons and conclusions above rest on the assumption that one search using ChatGPT uses around 3 Wh of electricity. Again, that comes from the statement that “ChatGPT is ten times as energy-intensive as a Google Search”.\\nThat’s what Andy assumes. It’s also the rule-of-thumb that I quoted in my previous article on the energy use of AI.\\nBut there is good reason to believe that we’re being incredibly conservative by using that number. I expect that energy use is now much lower than 3 Wh based on efficiency improvements in the last few years.\\nMore up-to-date analyses suggest that a ChatGPT query now uses just 0.3 Wh — ten times less. In fact, the analysts at Epoch AI still think that they’re still being pessimistic/conservative with that 0.3 Wh estimate, so it could be even lower.\\nThat would mean that our already small environmental impact numbers from above are ten times too high. 10 queries a day would not be equal to 0.2% of a Brit’s electricity consumption, but 0.02% instead.\\nI cannot say for certain that 0.3 Wh is the best “updated” number. But I’d bet that the real number is closer to 0.3 than to 3 Wh.\\nI mentioned this in my previous article, but let me say again how crazy I think it is that we’re left debating the order-of-magnitude energy use of LLMs. We’re not just talking about whether it’s 3, 3.5 or 4 Wh. We’re talking about whether our current calculations are ten times too high. Of course, tech companies do know what the right number is; it’s just that a lack of transparency means the rest of us are left bumbling around, wasting time.\\nIf you were to use the 0.3 Wh estimate instead, here are some comparisons of how ChatGPT queries compare to other activities. This is shown for different lengths of query inputs. Most people are using a “typical” query, which is less than 100 words. It’s a simple question. There are then longer (7,500 words) and maximum-length queries (75,000 words) which use more energy, but I don’t know anyone giving ChatGPT an entire book to read.\\nA typical query uses far less energy than a standard lightbulb, or even just running your laptop for 5 minutes.\\nA standard text-based search with ChatGPT uses a tiny amount of energy. We are not going to make a dent in climate change by stigmatising it or making people feel guilty.\\nWhat I am not saying\\nLet me again be clear about what I’m saying and not saying here.\\nFor the regular or even relatively high user of text-based LLMs: stop stressing about the energy and carbon footprint. It’s not a big deal, and restraining yourself from making 5 searches a day is not going to make a difference. In fact, it might have a net negative impact because you’re losing out on some of the benefits and efficiencies that come from these models.\\nThis is not necessarily the case for power users who generate lots of high-quality videos and audio. Apparently, generating pictures has a similar energy cost to text-based queries, so the above still applies there. But I don’t have the numbers on video and audio, and I expect the footprint to be significantly larger.\\nI am not saying that AI energy demand, on aggregate, is not a problem. It is, even if it’s “just” of a similar magnitude to the other sectors that we need to electrify, such as cars, heating, or parts of industry. It’s just that individuals querying chatbots is a relatively small part of AI\\'s total energy consumption. That’s how both of these facts can be true at the same time.\\nAgain, Andy Masley covered this in much more detail, so if you want to dig deeper then check his articles out:\\nNote that this doesn\\'t just include your own household electricity use. It also includes the electricity for public transport, services, and industry that make up our entire economy.\\nThat\\'s 3 grams, multiplied by 10 per day, multiplied by 365 days.\\nThese are consumption-based emissions, so they adjust for the carbon footprint of goods that are imported into the UK and ultimately \"consumed\" by them.\\nHuge fan of your work so the shoutout means a lot, thanks so much for sharing the posts and adding context!\\nThanks for this article Hannah. After reading, I have a few thoughts, I would be interested to hear your take on them.\\n1) Maybe one individual LLM use does not have a crazy emission/water impact, but it doesn\\'t mean we should downplay our collective impact. For example, I can argue that my individual fast fashion consumption has such a low impact, only a couple of thousand liters of water, + a few kilos of textile waste per year. Who cares? Maybe true, my individual actions, if looked at in a bubble, don\\'t have the biggest impact. But the thing is, I\\'m not the only one doing it. We do it collectively, and when everyone is buying fast fashion / uses LLMs, our impacts add up. And not just the environmental impact, but using and engaging with AI is a signal for companies that there is demand, so they will do even more of it. (I want to mention that I agree, there are good use cases for AI, but when it is shoved into every single product and allows us to do useless (generate funny images for no reason) or even harmful (spew out misinformation shared on social media) things, it is a misuse of our resources. And we definitely don\\'t need more of AI that does these useless / harmful things.)\\n2) There is also an indirect environmental cost of using AI, in the form of mining, toxic chemical use, and environmental destruction of digging out all the necessary raw material to produce the hardware AI runs on. Would love to see that accounted for.\\nSo I\\'m not anti-AI, but I\\'m sceptical & cautious, and I believe both individuals and companies should be more intentional with their AI use.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 3, {'article': 'Page title: AI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSocial card title: AI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSocial card description: An in-depth look at the hype and reality around “agentic AI” — the use of AI agents that perform tasks autonomously.\\xa0\\nAI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSimply sign up to the Artificial intelligence myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\\nAI is moving from “co-pilot” to “autopilot”. The development of generative artificial intelligence is increasingly focused on “agentic AI”: the use of AI agents that perform tasks autonomously, either within fixed parameters or to achieve goals set by the user.\\nBring in the agents\\nAI agents are not new but they are becoming ever more sophisticated. In their basic form they are simply tools built to carry out tasks such as answering queries to a script, as chatbots do, or fetching information from the web. These functions are limited, requiring no follow-up action without further input. Such reactive AI systems operate solely on programmed responses.\\nMore complex AI agents, with autonomy and adaptability, have also been around for a long time. They control home thermostats and automate factory processes.\\nTech for Growth Forum\\nThis type of technology is, however, rapidly developing capabilities beyond fetching and delivering information or performing distinct tasks. AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can analyse data, learn from it and make decisions based on both programmed rules and information acquired through interaction with their environment.\\nSuch adaptable AI can perform increasingly complex actions in pursuit of a goal and without taking a prescribed path. Using advanced machine learning and neural networks, it can understand context, analyse and respond to dynamic situations, learn from experience and use problem-solving and reasoning to make strategic decisions.\\nPredictive capabilities based on historical statistical analysis add another layer, enabling AI agents to plan, automate and execute tasks as well as to make informed decisions with specific goals in mind. They carry out their tasks after being given natural language prompts and without constant user input. They can also be designed to check each other’s work in an iterative process that improves quality and reliability.\\nFoundations for progress\\nSeveral developments have enabled AI agents to become more complex while at the same time being easier to use. Generative AI has provided a natural language interface, broadening access to AI, especially for users who are less tech-savvy. Generative AI interprets a prompt by the user then other AI fulfils the task. Google says: “Generative AI is just one piece of the AI puzzle. Other AI technologies, like predictive AI, vision AI, and conversational AI, are crucial for building sophisticated AI agents.”\\nAdvances in computing power and memory have enabled large language models and more sophisticated machine learning. The understanding of context and the ability to plan has improved as AI systems learn more data and improve their capacity to remember interactions.\\nThese are the foundations for AI agents, with the ease of interaction accelerating development as more users gain access. At the same time AI itself is speeding up the innovation cycle, refining its outputs and creating iterative processes at ever higher speeds.\\nHype or reality?\\nAI agents can speed up analysis and decisions as well as taking over certain functions from employees but they still fall short of full autonomy.\\nCassie Kozyrkov, the founder and chief executive of Decision Intelligence and formerly chief decision scientist at Google, says AI agents’ main role in an enterprise still lies in taking over repetitive tasks with “well understood and well designed processes” that do not require “creative spin”.\\nWhile there is huge potential for agentic AI to perform ever more complex tasks, Pascal Bornet, an expert in automation and author of Agentic Artificial Intelligence, points to a “significant gap” between hype and reality. Even with a clear directive, systems cannot yet perform complex tasks end to end, especially in nuanced or novel situations, without some human oversight.\\nThat said, the field “is advancing rapidly”. Bornet likens development to the progression from fully manual to fully autonomous cars, which is rated from level zero to level five. Currently, autonomous cars operate at levels two to four, depending on the environment. Automation can handle many tasks but human oversight, and occasional intervention, is needed.\\nAI agents are at a similar stage. Most operate at levels two or three, with some “specialised systems” reaching level four in tightly defined domains. Level five, where agents fully understand, plan and execute complex missions with minimal human input across any domain or corporate boundary, remains theoretical.\\nGiven the challenges involved in folding capabilities into a coherent system, fully integrated multimodal agents are some way off but Bornet says the building blocks are in place. He says some applications, such as that developed for veterinarians by Pets at Home, the UK FT250 company, exemplify audio processing but multimodal systems will require a sophisticated orchestration of agents with different types of expertise.\\nFunctional applications\\nWhile some sectors have adopted agentic AI more than others, as covered below, it can be put to work in functions that are common to most businesses. Bornet says the opportunity is systemic. “Agentic AI isn’t coming for a [single] department, it’s coming for all of them. Every workflow with friction is a use case waiting to be transformed.”\\nCurrently agents are used mostly in internal roles to gain efficiency and savings rather than top-line growth. A 2025 report from UK Finance co-authored with Accenture said: “Most near-term uses involve single-agent deployments targeting productivity and efficiency gains and improvements to customer and colleague experience”. The trade body found “relatively few” examples within financial services aimed at increasing sales or revenue. It also noted that most deployments were “closely monitored by an employee acting as a competent supervisor”.\\nAcross industry, AI that can reduce the time spent on mundane work to “free up” employees for more creative or skilled tasks has been adopted faster than elsewhere.\\nBornet and his team have gathered data from 167 companies in various sectors that have deployed what he classifies as level three LLM-based agents in production environments. Customer service, internal operations, and sales and marketing functions have seen the highest adoption, with benefits ranging from time savings of 12 to 30 per cent in customer service, 30 to 90 per cent in internal operations and increased revenue of nine to 21 per cent for sales and marketing teams.\\nIt should be noted that the use of AI agents alongside humans does not always enhance performance. An analysis of a customer service software company by the US National Bureau of Economic Research found that AI both improved issue resolution and cut the time taken. However it was newer staff who benefited most, with the AI electronically transferring the knowledge of experienced people. The performance of older hands did not improve.\\nThe reverse can be true in roles that are highly skilled. Attila Kecsmar, the co-founder and chief executive of Antavo, the AI loyalty cloud programme platform, says that in more technical areas, such as programming, those who use AI without an adequate understanding of the output will struggle, while the productivity and speed of competent workers will be supercharged.\\nCustomer service\\nThis has been the most visible deployment of AI from a consumer perspective but feedback has been mixed. Industry proponents say how well chatbots perform but customer surveys suggest the opposite. Preferences could change as customer service agents develop and digital natives make up more of the consumer base. Better responses and 24/7 support may improve customer perceptions.\\nOlder agents answered queries based on set scripts that quickly ran out of road, especially with complex queries. Newer agents, given their ability to remember and respond to dynamic inputs, are more responsive. They are able to act based on up to date client data as well as to recall historical interactions with customers.\\nWith agentic AI, customer service interfaces have developed beyond dial-up chatbots. Google Gemini is behind Volkswagen’s MyVW app, a virtual assistant that answers a driver’s queries about their car.\\nCoding\\nThe application of AI in coding is well documented. In a report by the McKinsey consultancy, Lenovo said that its engineers’ speed and quality of code production improved by 10 per cent.\\nKecsmar agrees that agent-supported engineers can achieve much more but says this in turn will lead to rising expectations for human productivity and performance. Given natural language interfaces, it is increasingly feasible for laypeople to write code.\\nThis is the real revolution in agentic AI, Kozyrkov says. “Before, you had to go and get yourself schooled in the arcane arts of some new language and now you don’t — you speak your mother tongue and it works.”\\nWhile this presents an opportunity, she cautions that it is also one of the greatest risks in deploying AI in an enterprise. “Unfortunately the mother tongue is vague and not everybody knows when they’re being ambiguous. Now you can program a machine without thinking it through, so it’s hardly a surprise that you get unintended consequences.”\\nMarketing and campaign management\\nAs covered in our report on personalisation and marketing, AI has hugely expanded the reach of marketing departments, enabling mass communications to be targeted at ever smaller segments.\\nAI agents can take this further. Antavo has developed an AI agent for its brand customers which helps them to devise and communicate loyalty programmes and campaigns. It can decide an appropriate approach for a brand in any sector and analyse data and give ideas, illustrated with charts, on how to optimise and develop a programme. It can also look inwards, finding and delivering relevant information to help customer service employees resolve consumers’ queries.\\nHuman resources\\nAI agents can be used in hiring, scheduling meetings, retention and management, predicting turnover and identifying where training may be required.\\nVirtual assistants\\nThese are capable of executing simple tasks with minimal supervision, such as scheduling meetings with clients, sending standard emails and general client communications. Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, can find information from many sources in a computer so that it can complete a form.\\nFinance\\nApplications include AI systems that can make trading decisions based on real-time data analysis or systems that suggest investment strategies based on a client’s profile. AI can also help with identifying fraud, flagging its suspicions in real time.\\nHealthcare\\nAutonomous diagnostic tools can identify problems using patient histories and images, recommend personalised healthcare treatments, monitor patient health and recommend or remind people about follow-up actions. AI agents can be deployed in robotic-assisted surgery to improve control and accuracy. Pattern recognition, deep learning and computer vision all enhance machines’ ability to adjust surgery incisions in real time. Systems such as Philips’ IntelliVue Guardian manage postsurgical complications by providing early warnings for those patients most at risk.\\nLaw\\nIn addition to simple and repetitive tasks such as contract drafting, agents can advise on cases. Based on analysis of historical data or judges’ rulings they can predict potential outcomes to a suit and suggest arguments.\\nAlready A&O Shearman, the international law firm, is using an AI tool created in collaboration with Harvey, a start-up. This makes use of a business’s financial information to assess in which jurisdictions a client needs to file in the event of a merger. It then identifies any missing data and drafts the information requests for each party.\\nManufacturing and logistics\\nWhile autonomous cars have yet to reach the mainstream, autonomous lorries are about to arrive. Aurora Innovation, which works with Volvo, Uber and FedEx in the US, plans to use 10 driverless lorries between Dallas and Houston. AI agents are also used in manufacturing for monitoring and maintaining equipment and optimising processes. They can perform quality control on both inputs and outputs with greater consistency than humans.\\nRetail\\nBeside the chatbots deployed in customer service, AI agents can be used along the supply chain to monitor and manage inventory levels based on historical data and to predict trends and demands.\\nDrawbacks\\nThere are various issues that enterprises need to consider when adopting AI.\\nCompanies operating with legacy tech or which have inadequate or inconsistent data will find it harder to make progress. Any data quality issues experienced when training agents will be exacerbated by “slop” the colloquial name for the proliferation of LLM-created content.\\nEY says this could be solved in part by agents sourcing information from several inputs rather than relying on static scraped data. For instance iterative AI could gather data from wearables, which would layer current and contextual data on top of historical information.\\nConnection within and between companies is hampered by data incompatibilities as well as the inadequacies of existing application programming interfaces. Bornet says the lack of a standard protocol presents a hurdle to multi-agent systems that might otherwise cross corporate boundaries.\\nKecsmar believes this problem may itself be solved by agents. “In future the agents developed around data exchange skills will be able to create their own data exchange. They will be uploaded with how their host company communicates data and they will have a tool call to interface data between different sources.”\\nTrust is a problem in several areas, for instance in sectors where the options for reversal are limited. “‘Fully automate and leave it’ in the financial services industry is a terrible idea,” Kozyrkov says, adding that “the golden rule of AI is that it makes mistakes”. Consumers might be unwilling to let agents have autonomy over their bank accounts or credit cards. There is also a lack of trust among leaders in terms of AI performance and with workers who face the risk of replacement. Once systems can link up across business boundaries, will companies trust external agents?\\nUse of untrammelled AI also adds to cyber security threats by increasing points of access and the risk of unexpected actions. Kozyrkov says: “One of the top suggestions is: limit its access. Don’t give it any data that you wouldn’t want leaked.” Granting AI the same access as a human employee dramatically increases the attack surface, meaning systems are more vulnerable.\\nConstraint on computing capacity is a further hurdle. Despite the investment in infrastructure the competition for stretched resources is fierce. Still, no user pays what it costs to run an AI query even in energy terms, a point raised at an FT Climate Capital Council round table last year. For companies using commercial services, current pricing is based on the number of employees — but what will happen if staff levels shrink due to AI adoption?\\nCompanies also need to consider the ethical implications of AI adoption. Research at Cambridge university notes that — if they cannot already — agents may soon be able to predict our habits and spending patterns and influence or manipulate them, although this is likely to be of greater concern to consumers.\\nAccountability is another imponderable. With whom does this lie when agents are carrying out end to end tasks without human intervention, or with connections to other companies?\\nHow to adopt AI agents\\nAs with any new technology, it is important to identify business needs first. Bornet says the most sophisticated option is not necessarily always the best — successful implementation lies in choosing the right level for each application.\\n“Consider a financial services company implementing AI agents,” he says. “They might choose level one or two agents for transaction processing, where predictability and audit trails are crucial. However they might implement level three agents for customer service, where adaptability and context awareness are more valuable than strict control.”\\nKeeping an agent’s function as simple as possible means there is less scope for problems. Bornet recommends starting with repetitive tasks such as meeting documentation and follow-ups.\\nTransparency is also key. Bornet says his team has encountered the consequences of both a lack of control over AI adoption and an employee’s unchecked enthusiasm. This ranges from “worker anxiety and resignations in a manufacturing company to reputational damage when agents made unauthorised decisions in a financial firm”. They found that inadequate technical knowledge, governance, or change management stymied adoption in several cases.\\nKozyrkov, while “incredibly excited for all the ways AI can be used to fuel innovation”, cautions that it must be used wisely. It is vital to have safeguards and to clearly define objectives to avoid unanticipated consequences. “The future is modularisation. You wouldn’t trust the smartest human to do everything, so why would you trust an AI?”\\nShe sees people having a central role, even in a future with AI. “If your goal is to remove humans as quickly as possible, you may find yourself removing key human functions without perhaps realising what you’ve removed.” The most fruitful results, she says, will come to those who see AI agents as a way to “elevate the worker” rather than viewing the latter as “an overseer for the agentic system”.\\nDesigning processes with AI in mind will give an advantage, Kecsmar says, advising that companies should think about developing or deploying AI-native rather than AI-enabled tools. The effect of “native AI” is more meaningful than what he calls “uplift AI”, where agents such as chatbots simply make jobs easier. This means building AI capabilities from the ground up, not just seeing them as a bolt-on. Companies should think of AI as a strategic capability, they should rethink processes to optimise the function of AI agents.\\nWinners and losers\\nIt is clear that AI is already disrupting workforces. Klarna, the Swedish fintech company, said in late 2024 that it would be able to halve its employee count by using AI, while customer services companies have been changing the mix of human and AI agents. The logistics sector has also seen the effect of AI: Amazon has used autonomous robots in its warehouses for years.\\nThis potential for AI agents to unseat entire work teams might delay their adoption in existing businesses, which will give an advantage to start-ups that build agents into processes and systems. For such AI-native companies, agents will be integrated into workflows from day one and they will also act as virtual workers with specialisations previously outside the range of most small companies.\\nKecsmar says Antavo adopted this “AI-first” mindset in developing its agent to help customers plan their loyalty programmes. Rather than design a technology that could take step by step inputs to create a loyalty strategy, the agent digests a brand’s goals and devises an execution plan. Kecsmar believes such tools will turn any company strategy into an executable plan.\\nUltimately AI might also help to devise plans to develop products and markets, shifting its contribution from cost and efficiency to top-line gains.\\nFurther advances will be possible once agents can talk to each other across data and company boundaries. Kecsmar believes people will then be able to command specialised agents from different providers to work together via an “orchestration layer”. For instance, agents from a marketing specialist could talk to those from point of sale and loyalty specialists to assess a customer’s data and devise a campaign.\\nThis could threaten horizontal workflow managers whose selling point is interoperability, for instance third-party logistics fulfilment or customer resources management. In a sign of where things might head, Klarna said it would abandon its use of Workday and Salesforce and develop its own software using AI.\\nNot everyone agrees. Kozyrkov says many software-as-a-service companies are building their own agents. “It will likely make a lot more sense for you to use Agentforce over building your own agent unless there’s some very compelling reason why you wouldn’t want a company that you already trust with that data to be helping you save time using its products.” Connecting that company’s agents to the rest of your business is another matter.\\nConclusion\\nIt is clear that there is potential for the use of AI agents but companies must have a clear, needs-based strategy and be fully aware of the risks and how to mitigate them.\\nFor companies that are early adopters of more advanced agents there will be huge benefits. These systems learn as they go along, which means they improve with time, providing even more advantages than previous, more static technologies.\\n“AI agents create what we call ‘compounding intelligence advantages’,”, Bornet says. “Early adopters will train agents faster, redefine business models and develop AI expertise,” leaving behind any companies that delay.\\n“AI agents are really going to help those who know what they need done, what it looks like when it’s done and have a way to limit surprises,” Kozyrkov says.\\nComments'}\n",

Stop Using Markdown and Start Minifying | HackerNoon\\nSocial card description: Markdown tables can break multilingual RAG pipelines due to character limits in Cohere’s API. Learn how minifying to JSON boosts efficiency and prevents errors.\\nIn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, input efficiency is paramount, not just in terms of tokens, but also character limits\\nWhen building a multilingual embedding pipeline, I faced a real challenge:the Cohere multilingual model imposes a maximum of 2048 characters not a token limit per input.\\nThis article walks you through a clever solution: preprocessing Markdown tables into dense JSON blocks using pymtd2json\\n, to ensure smooth, efficient embeddings without errors.\\nThe Challenge: Character Limits vs Token Limits\\nClassical chunking methods, like SentenceSplitter\\nfrom LlamaIndex, are token-focused: you set a maximum number of tokens per chunk — but not characters\\nWhy This Matters:\\n- Markdown (especially GitHub-Flavored Markdown, GFM) wastes spacewith formatting.\\n- A Markdown chunk might have only 170 tokens but still exceed 2048 characters\\n- This results in rejected API requests or inefficient extra splitting.\\nImportant Note: Markdown tables are up to 3x less token-efficient than other formats, further compounding the problem.👉 Read more on token inefficiency of Markdown tables here.\\nA Real-World Example: Measuring the Problem\\nLet\\'s dive into a simple simulation:\\nStep 1: Create a Large Markdown Table\\nimport pandas as pd\\n# Build data\\ndata = {\\n\"Name\": [f\"Person{i}\" for i in range(30)],\\n\"Age\": [20 + i for i in range(30)],\\n\"City\": [f\"City{i}\" for i in range(30)]\\n}\\n# Create DataFrame\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\\ndf.columns = [\"A very long row content, which leads to a lot of white spaces\", \"Age\", \"City\"]\\n# Convert to Markdown\\ntable_text = df.to_markdown(index=False)\\nprint(table_text)\\nThis generates a verbose table with 30 rows and a very long header.\\nStep 2: Analyze Token and Character Counts\\nUsing Cohere’s tokenizer (available via Hugging Face):\\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Cohere/Cohere-embed-multilingual-v3.0\")\\nencoded = tokenizer(table_text, return_tensors=\"pt\", add_special_tokens=False)\\nnum_tokens = encoded.input_ids.shape[-1]\\nnum_chars = len(table_text)\\nprint(f\"Characters: {num_chars}\")\\nprint(f\"Tokens: {num_tokens}\")\\nResult:\\n- Characters: 2719\\n- Tokens: 432\\n⚡ Problem: While token count is fine, character count exceeds 2048, causing API errors like:\\ncohere.error.CohereAPIError: input text exceeds maximum allowed size of 2048 characters\\nThe Solution: Minifying Tables into JSON\\nInstead of traditional Markdown, why not store the data in a dense JSON block?\\nBenefits of Minifying Tables:\\n- Remove pipes, dashes, and whitespace, all formatting overhead.\\n- Preserve semantic meaning.\\n- Shrink text to meet character limits safely.\\nExample of the compact JSON:\\n{\"Name\":[\"Person0\",\"Person1\",\"Person2\",...],\"Age\":[\"20\",\"21\",\"22\",...],\"City\":[\"City0\",\"City1\",\"City2\",...]}\\nNew Stats:\\n- Characters: 1027\\n- Tokens: 461\\n✅ Now well within Cohere’s input limit!\\nApplying Minification in Practice\\nWant to prepare documents before chunking? Here\\'s how you can automatically process all Markdown files:\\nfrom pathlib import Path\\nfrom llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader\\nfrom your_minifier import MinifyMDT\\nsource_dir = Path(\"example_dir\", \"markdown\")\\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(source_dir, required_exts=[\".md\"], recursive=True).load_data()\\ndoc_texts = []\\nfor idx, doc in enumerate(documents):\\ndoc_texts.append(MinifyMDT(doc.text_resource.text).transform())\\n👉 And voilà: Your data is compact, clean, and embedding-ready!\\nFinal Thoughts\\nWorking with multilingual RAG systems means optimizing every byte. Whitespace-heavy Markdown tables might look nice for humans, but they’re expensive for machine understanding.\\nBy minifying your tables with pymtd2json\\n, you:\\n- Cut down API errors.\\n- Reduce token overhead.\\n- Boost overall performance.\\nEfficiency isn\\'t optional, it\\'s a superpower. 🚀'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 6, {'article': 'Page title: AI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSocial card title: AI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSocial card description: An in-depth look at the hype and reality around “agentic AI” — the use of AI agents that perform tasks autonomously.\\xa0\\nAI agents: from co-pilot to autopilot\\nSimply sign up to the Artificial intelligence myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.\\nAI is moving from “co-pilot” to “autopilot”. The development of generative artificial intelligence is increasingly focused on “agentic AI”: the use of AI agents that perform tasks autonomously, either within fixed parameters or to achieve goals set by the user.\\nBring in the agents\\nAI agents are not new but they are becoming ever more sophisticated. In their basic form they are simply tools built to carry out tasks such as answering queries to a script, as chatbots do, or fetching information from the web. These functions are limited, requiring no follow-up action without further input. Such reactive AI systems operate solely on programmed responses.\\nMore complex AI agents, with autonomy and adaptability, have also been around for a long time. They control home thermostats and automate factory processes.\\nTech for Growth Forum\\nThis type of technology is, however, rapidly developing capabilities beyond fetching and delivering information or performing distinct tasks. AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can analyse data, learn from it and make decisions based on both programmed rules and information acquired through interaction with their environment.\\nSuch adaptable AI can perform increasingly complex actions in pursuit of a goal and without taking a prescribed path. Using advanced machine learning and neural networks, it can understand context, analyse and respond to dynamic situations, learn from experience and use problem-solving and reasoning to make strategic decisions.\\nPredictive capabilities based on historical statistical analysis add another layer, enabling AI agents to plan, automate and execute tasks as well as to make informed decisions with specific goals in mind. They carry out their tasks after being given natural language prompts and without constant user input. They can also be designed to check each other’s work in an iterative process that improves quality and reliability.\\nFoundations for progress\\nSeveral developments have enabled AI agents to become more complex while at the same time being easier to use. Generative AI has provided a natural language interface, broadening access to AI, especially for users who are less tech-savvy. Generative AI interprets a prompt by the user then other AI fulfils the task. Google says: “Generative AI is just one piece of the AI puzzle. Other AI technologies, like predictive AI, vision AI, and conversational AI, are crucial for building sophisticated AI agents.”\\nAdvances in computing power and memory have enabled large language models and more sophisticated machine learning. The understanding of context and the ability to plan has improved as AI systems learn more data and improve their capacity to remember interactions.\\nThese are the foundations for AI agents, with the ease of interaction accelerating development as more users gain access. At the same time AI itself is speeding up the innovation cycle, refining its outputs and creating iterative processes at ever higher speeds.\\nHype or reality?\\nAI agents can speed up analysis and decisions as well as taking over certain functions from employees but they still fall short of full autonomy.\\nCassie Kozyrkov, the founder and chief executive of Decision Intelligence and formerly chief decision scientist at Google, says AI agents’ main role in an enterprise still lies in taking over repetitive tasks with “well understood and well designed processes” that do not require “creative spin”.\\nWhile there is huge potential for agentic AI to perform ever more complex tasks, Pascal Bornet, an expert in automation and author of Agentic Artificial Intelligence, points to a “significant gap” between hype and reality. Even with a clear directive, systems cannot yet perform complex tasks end to end, especially in nuanced or novel situations, without some human oversight.\\nThat said, the field “is advancing rapidly”. Bornet likens development to the progression from fully manual to fully autonomous cars, which is rated from level zero to level five. Currently, autonomous cars operate at levels two to four, depending on the environment. Automation can handle many tasks but human oversight, and occasional intervention, is needed.\\nAI agents are at a similar stage. Most operate at levels two or three, with some “specialised systems” reaching level four in tightly defined domains. Level five, where agents fully understand, plan and execute complex missions with minimal human input across any domain or corporate boundary, remains theoretical.\\nGiven the challenges involved in folding capabilities into a coherent system, fully integrated multimodal agents are some way off but Bornet says the building blocks are in place. He says some applications, such as that developed for veterinarians by Pets at Home, the UK FT250 company, exemplify audio processing but multimodal systems will require a sophisticated orchestration of agents with different types of expertise.\\nFunctional applications\\nWhile some sectors have adopted agentic AI more than others, as covered below, it can be put to work in functions that are common to most businesses. Bornet says the opportunity is systemic. “Agentic AI isn’t coming for a [single] department, it’s coming for all of them. Every workflow with friction is a use case waiting to be transformed.”\\nCurrently agents are used mostly in internal roles to gain efficiency and savings rather than top-line growth. A 2025 report from UK Finance co-authored with Accenture said: “Most near-term uses involve single-agent deployments targeting productivity and efficiency gains and improvements to customer and colleague experience”. The trade body found “relatively few” examples within financial services aimed at increasing sales or revenue. It also noted that most deployments were “closely monitored by an employee acting as a competent supervisor”.\\nAcross industry, AI that can reduce the time spent on mundane work to “free up” employees for more creative or skilled tasks has been adopted faster than elsewhere.\\nBornet and his team have gathered data from 167 companies in various sectors that have deployed what he classifies as level three LLM-based agents in production environments. Customer service, internal operations, and sales and marketing functions have seen the highest adoption, with benefits ranging from time savings of 12 to 30 per cent in customer service, 30 to 90 per cent in internal operations and increased revenue of nine to 21 per cent for sales and marketing teams.\\nIt should be noted that the use of AI agents alongside humans does not always enhance performance. An analysis of a customer service software company by the US National Bureau of Economic Research found that AI both improved issue resolution and cut the time taken. However it was newer staff who benefited most, with the AI electronically transferring the knowledge of experienced people. The performance of older hands did not improve.\\nThe reverse can be true in roles that are highly skilled. Attila Kecsmar, the co-founder and chief executive of Antavo, the AI loyalty cloud programme platform, says that in more technical areas, such as programming, those who use AI without an adequate understanding of the output will struggle, while the productivity and speed of competent workers will be supercharged.\\nCustomer service\\nThis has been the most visible deployment of AI from a consumer perspective but feedback has been mixed. Industry proponents say how well chatbots perform but customer surveys suggest the opposite. Preferences could change as customer service agents develop and digital natives make up more of the consumer base. Better responses and 24/7 support may improve customer perceptions.\\nOlder agents answered queries based on set scripts that quickly ran out of road, especially with complex queries. Newer agents, given their ability to remember and respond to dynamic inputs, are more responsive. They are able to act based on up to date client data as well as to recall historical interactions with customers.\\nWith agentic AI, customer service interfaces have developed beyond dial-up chatbots. Google Gemini is behind Volkswagen’s MyVW app, a virtual assistant that answers a driver’s queries about their car.\\nCoding\\nThe application of AI in coding is well documented. In a report by the McKinsey consultancy, Lenovo said that its engineers’ speed and quality of code production improved by 10 per cent.\\nKecsmar agrees that agent-supported engineers can achieve much more but says this in turn will lead to rising expectations for human productivity and performance. Given natural language interfaces, it is increasingly feasible for laypeople to write code.\\nThis is the real revolution in agentic AI, Kozyrkov says. “Before, you had to go and get yourself schooled in the arcane arts of some new language and now you don’t — you speak your mother tongue and it works.”\\nWhile this presents an opportunity, she cautions that it is also one of the greatest risks in deploying AI in an enterprise. “Unfortunately the mother tongue is vague and not everybody knows when they’re being ambiguous. Now you can program a machine without thinking it through, so it’s hardly a surprise that you get unintended consequences.”\\nMarketing and campaign management\\nAs covered in our report on personalisation and marketing, AI has hugely expanded the reach of marketing departments, enabling mass communications to be targeted at ever smaller segments.\\nAI agents can take this further. Antavo has developed an AI agent for its brand customers which helps them to devise and communicate loyalty programmes and campaigns. It can decide an appropriate approach for a brand in any sector and analyse data and give ideas, illustrated with charts, on how to optimise and develop a programme. It can also look inwards, finding and delivering relevant information to help customer service employees resolve consumers’ queries.\\nHuman resources\\nAI agents can be used in hiring, scheduling meetings, retention and management, predicting turnover and identifying where training may be required.\\nVirtual assistants\\nThese are capable of executing simple tasks with minimal supervision, such as scheduling meetings with clients, sending standard emails and general client communications. Claude, Anthropic’s AI model, can find information from many sources in a computer so that it can complete a form.\\nFinance\\nApplications include AI systems that can make trading decisions based on real-time data analysis or systems that suggest investment strategies based on a client’s profile. AI can also help with identifying fraud, flagging its suspicions in real time.\\nHealthcare\\nAutonomous diagnostic tools can identify problems using patient histories and images, recommend personalised healthcare treatments, monitor patient health and recommend or remind people about follow-up actions. AI agents can be deployed in robotic-assisted surgery to improve control and accuracy. Pattern recognition, deep learning and computer vision all enhance machines’ ability to adjust surgery incisions in real time. Systems such as Philips’ IntelliVue Guardian manage postsurgical complications by providing early warnings for those patients most at risk.\\nLaw\\nIn addition to simple and repetitive tasks such as contract drafting, agents can advise on cases. Based on analysis of historical data or judges’ rulings they can predict potential outcomes to a suit and suggest arguments.\\nAlready A&O Shearman, the international law firm, is using an AI tool created in collaboration with Harvey, a start-up. This makes use of a business’s financial information to assess in which jurisdictions a client needs to file in the event of a merger. It then identifies any missing data and drafts the information requests for each party.\\nManufacturing and logistics\\nWhile autonomous cars have yet to reach the mainstream, autonomous lorries are about to arrive. Aurora Innovation, which works with Volvo, Uber and FedEx in the US, plans to use 10 driverless lorries between Dallas and Houston. AI agents are also used in manufacturing for monitoring and maintaining equipment and optimising processes. They can perform quality control on both inputs and outputs with greater consistency than humans.\\nRetail\\nBeside the chatbots deployed in customer service, AI agents can be used along the supply chain to monitor and manage inventory levels based on historical data and to predict trends and demands.\\nDrawbacks\\nThere are various issues that enterprises need to consider when adopting AI.\\nCompanies operating with legacy tech or which have inadequate or inconsistent data will find it harder to make progress. Any data quality issues experienced when training agents will be exacerbated by “slop” the colloquial name for the proliferation of LLM-created content.\\nEY says this could be solved in part by agents sourcing information from several inputs rather than relying on static scraped data. For instance iterative AI could gather data from wearables, which would layer current and contextual data on top of historical information.\\nConnection within and between companies is hampered by data incompatibilities as well as the inadequacies of existing application programming interfaces. Bornet says the lack of a standard protocol presents a hurdle to multi-agent systems that might otherwise cross corporate boundaries.\\nKecsmar believes this problem may itself be solved by agents. “In future the agents developed around data exchange skills will be able to create their own data exchange. They will be uploaded with how their host company communicates data and they will have a tool call to interface data between different sources.”\\nTrust is a problem in several areas, for instance in sectors where the options for reversal are limited. “‘Fully automate and leave it’ in the financial services industry is a terrible idea,” Kozyrkov says, adding that “the golden rule of AI is that it makes mistakes”. Consumers might be unwilling to let agents have autonomy over their bank accounts or credit cards. There is also a lack of trust among leaders in terms of AI performance and with workers who face the risk of replacement. Once systems can link up across business boundaries, will companies trust external agents?\\nUse of untrammelled AI also adds to cyber security threats by increasing points of access and the risk of unexpected actions. Kozyrkov says: “One of the top suggestions is: limit its access. Don’t give it any data that you wouldn’t want leaked.” Granting AI the same access as a human employee dramatically increases the attack surface, meaning systems are more vulnerable.\\nConstraint on computing capacity is a further hurdle. Despite the investment in infrastructure the competition for stretched resources is fierce. Still, no user pays what it costs to run an AI query even in energy terms, a point raised at an FT Climate Capital Council round table last year. For companies using commercial services, current pricing is based on the number of employees — but what will happen if staff levels shrink due to AI adoption?\\nCompanies also need to consider the ethical implications of AI adoption. Research at Cambridge university notes that — if they cannot already — agents may soon be able to predict our habits and spending patterns and influence or manipulate them, although this is likely to be of greater concern to consumers.\\nAccountability is another imponderable. With whom does this lie when agents are carrying out end to end tasks without human intervention, or with connections to other companies?\\nHow to adopt AI agents\\nAs with any new technology, it is important to identify business needs first. Bornet says the most sophisticated option is not necessarily always the best — successful implementation lies in choosing the right level for each application.\\n“Consider a financial services company implementing AI agents,” he says. “They might choose level one or two agents for transaction processing, where predictability and audit trails are crucial. However they might implement level three agents for customer service, where adaptability and context awareness are more valuable than strict control.”\\nKeeping an agent’s function as simple as possible means there is less scope for problems. Bornet recommends starting with repetitive tasks such as meeting documentation and follow-ups.\\nTransparency is also key. Bornet says his team has encountered the consequences of both a lack of control over AI adoption and an employee’s unchecked enthusiasm. This ranges from “worker anxiety and resignations in a manufacturing company to reputational damage when agents made unauthorised decisions in a financial firm”. They found that inadequate technical knowledge, governance, or change management stymied adoption in several cases.\\nKozyrkov, while “incredibly excited for all the ways AI can be used to fuel innovation”, cautions that it must be used wisely. It is vital to have safeguards and to clearly define objectives to avoid unanticipated consequences. “The future is modularisation. You wouldn’t trust the smartest human to do everything, so why would you trust an AI?”\\nShe sees people having a central role, even in a future with AI. “If your goal is to remove humans as quickly as possible, you may find yourself removing key human functions without perhaps realising what you’ve removed.” The most fruitful results, she says, will come to those who see AI agents as a way to “elevate the worker” rather than viewing the latter as “an overseer for the agentic system”.\\nDesigning processes with AI in mind will give an advantage, Kecsmar says, advising that companies should think about developing or deploying AI-native rather than AI-enabled tools. The effect of “native AI” is more meaningful than what he calls “uplift AI”, where agents such as chatbots simply make jobs easier. This means building AI capabilities from the ground up, not just seeing them as a bolt-on. Companies should think of AI as a strategic capability, they should rethink processes to optimise the function of AI agents.\\nWinners and losers\\nIt is clear that AI is already disrupting workforces. Klarna, the Swedish fintech company, said in late 2024 that it would be able to halve its employee count by using AI, while customer services companies have been changing the mix of human and AI agents. The logistics sector has also seen the effect of AI: Amazon has used autonomous robots in its warehouses for years.\\nThis potential for AI agents to unseat entire work teams might delay their adoption in existing businesses, which will give an advantage to start-ups that build agents into processes and systems. For such AI-native companies, agents will be integrated into workflows from day one and they will also act as virtual workers with specialisations previously outside the range of most small companies.\\nKecsmar says Antavo adopted this “AI-first” mindset in developing its agent to help customers plan their loyalty programmes. Rather than design a technology that could take step by step inputs to create a loyalty strategy, the agent digests a brand’s goals and devises an execution plan. Kecsmar believes such tools will turn any company strategy into an executable plan.\\nUltimately AI might also help to devise plans to develop products and markets, shifting its contribution from cost and efficiency to top-line gains.\\nFurther advances will be possible once agents can talk to each other across data and company boundaries. Kecsmar believes people will then be able to command specialised agents from different providers to work together via an “orchestration layer”. For instance, agents from a marketing specialist could talk to those from point of sale and loyalty specialists to assess a customer’s data and devise a campaign.\\nThis could threaten horizontal workflow managers whose selling point is interoperability, for instance third-party logistics fulfilment or customer resources management. In a sign of where things might head, Klarna said it would abandon its use of Workday and Salesforce and develop its own software using AI.\\nNot everyone agrees. Kozyrkov says many software-as-a-service companies are building their own agents. “It will likely make a lot more sense for you to use Agentforce over building your own agent unless there’s some very compelling reason why you wouldn’t want a company that you already trust with that data to be helping you save time using its products.” Connecting that company’s agents to the rest of your business is another matter.\\nConclusion\\nIt is clear that there is potential for the use of AI agents but companies must have a clear, needs-based strategy and be fully aware of the risks and how to mitigate them.\\nFor companies that are early adopters of more advanced agents there will be huge benefits. These systems learn as they go along, which means they improve with time, providing even more advantages than previous, more static technologies.\\n“AI agents create what we call ‘compounding intelligence advantages’,”, Bornet says. “Early adopters will train agents faster, redefine business models and develop AI expertise,” leaving behind any companies that delay.\\n“AI agents are really going to help those who know what they need done, what it looks like when it’s done and have a way to limit surprises,” Kozyrkov says.\\nComments'}\n",

It relies on a network of more than 200,000 annotators and other professionals to create those datasets. According to Toloka, the experts in its network can create AI training materials in more than 40 languages.\\nAfter training a neural network, companies often apply optimizations to better align its output with user preferences. A retailer, for example, may prefer that each AI-generated shopping recommendation mention at least two products from its catalog. The process of aligning an AI model with user requirements involves supplying it with additional training data.\\nToloka says that its platform makes it easier for developers to source the necessary training data. It supports RLHF and DPO, the two most widely-used methods of aligning AI model output with user preferences. In RLHF projects, developers fine-tune an AI model’s output using a second neural network trained to understand user preferences. DPO, in contrast, doesn’t rely on a second neural network, which often makes the method more cost-efficient.\\nTraining AI programming assistants is another task that Toloka promises to ease. The company can provide code samples in more than a dozen programming languages. Users can customize details such as the number of code files in a training dataset, the tasks those files perform and the development frameworks they use.\\nBefore releasing an AI model to production, developers test that it’s safe using a method known as red-teaming. They supply the model with a large number of prompts that mimic malicious input and evaluate how it responds. According to Toloka, AI teams can source such prompts through its platform to speed up red-teaming initiatives.\\nThe company’s platform is used by Anthropic PBC, well-funded coding assistant startup Poolside and other major players in the AI market.

Only then should you consider where to introduce AI.\\nIn the previous post we looked at using AI to provide cognitive insights into complex datasets. Now we will look at another application for AI; cognitive engagement (CE).\\nWhat is cognitive engagement?\\nImagine you’re running a business, and your customers and employees are interacting with your organisation across multiple channels; chatbots, emails, social media, and phone calls. They have questions, concerns, and expectations, but keeping up with every interaction in a meaningful way is overwhelming. You want to engage with them effectively, but at scale? That’s the challenge, and it is where cognitive engagement (CE) can help.\\nCognitive engagement is the use of artificial intelligence to create meaningful, dynamic interactions between humans and machines. Unlike traditional automation, which follows rigid rules, cognitive engagement systems leverage AI technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and sentiment analysis to understand user intent, maintain context, and respond in a personalised way. They can handle complex queries, anticipate user needs, and even detect frustration or satisfaction, allowing businesses to enhance customer (and employee) interaction experiences at scale.\\nBy continuously learning from interactions, cognitive engagement systems improve over time, making conversations more intuitive and effective.\\nUse cases\\nThe two primary use cases for cognitive engagement that might apply to your business are:\\nCustomer engagement\\nThe most obvious use case for cognitive engagement is AI-powered customer support. In most cases where this is prevalent today, chatbots and virtual assistants use natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to provide instant, human-like responses to customer inquiries. They can handle routine questions, escalate complex issues to human agents, and improve service efficiency. And, like virtually all AI systems, they can learn and improve over time through machine learning (ML).\\nThese forms of interaction can be taken to the next level by layering on other AI driven technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Synthesis. These additional technologies would allow a customer to engage with your brand by speaking to an AI customer support agent in a conversational manner, rather than by written word.\\nEmployee engagement\\nAs with customers, large enterprises might also benefit from having an internal employee assistance or HR support tool. These AI-powered virtual assistants could help employees with HR-related queries, onboarding processes, and internal knowledge management, improving workplace efficiency and employee experience. Here at thoughtbot, we use machine learning to answer questions from internal documentation.\\nIn the previous blog post in this series, we looked at how cognitive insights can identify links in data that would be impossible to spot with the human eye. Cognitive engagement can take this one step further by allowing anyone to easily interact with these complex data sets. Rather than requiring data scientists to extract insights, business development employees could simply ask an AI assistant ‘Why has foot traffic dropped in one branch?’ and receive an immediate, conversational response.\\nAs employee engagement is less obvious than customer-facing AI support, let’s look at an example where this might be useful.\\nthoughtburgers employees understand decisions 🍔\\nAs has been common throughout this series, let’s revisit our delectable AI-powered side-business, thoughtburgers (home to the tastiest and most thought-provoking burgers!).\\nAs we discussed in the last post in the series, thoughtburgers has been a big hit and multiple branches have been opened in London. 🥳 We have used cognitive insights to streamline our deliveries in rush hour by tackling both driver scheduling and order triaging between branches. Happy days!\\nOrange boxes denote where cognitive insights were used to improve thoughtburgers’ delivery processes.\\nBut, wait! Not so fast! We are facing a new problem; some of our restaurant managers and drivers are not happy. Some managers are confused as to why their branch is more or less busy than usual. Some drivers are curious as to why they have been scheduled on fewer shifts. Did they do something wrong? Are they being punished?\\nThe answer to these questions is no. These decisions are actually based on sound data from our cognitive insights project but, without transparency, thoughtburgers will face confusion and resistance from our team. Transparency and engaging with the team will be critical to the successful adoption of this new technology.\\nAnd this is where cognitive engagement comes in. We could leverage CE to help the team better understand the logic behind the decisions being taken. Interacting with a Natural Language Processing chatbot would provide our team with an easy-to-understand way to query decisions, understand and interact with complex data, and to identify areas they need to improve if they want more shifts or orders for their branch.\\nRed boxes denote where cognitive engagement interactions could be useful for thoughtburgers’ employees.\\nFor example, the manager of Branch A might now be able to understand that they are getting fewer orders in rush hour because their kitchen was so busy and stressful that it was leading to employee turnover, hurting their bottom line in the process. The manager of Branch B might realise they would get more orders if their food was prepared a little faster, and they can now take action to make this a reality. This gives our branch managers a sense of ownership, inclusion and control in the decision making process.\\nKlarna - Benefits and challenges 💵\\nA good case study for the benefits and challenges of cognitive engagement is Klarna; a Swedish fintech company that provides online financial services.\\nKlarna made quite a splash when they stopped hiring in 2023. They were championing AI chatbots which they claimed could handle the majority of their customer service volume. On the surface, it’s easy to see why.\\nBenefits:\\nImagine a world where you could pick up the phone, at any time of the day or night, to call a support agent. They answer immediately. No more will we hear “your call is important to us” followed by a tinny rendition of Symphony No 40 that would have Mozart turning in his grave (and not to the beat). You will also not have to listen to a spiel about “for accounts, press 1” and patiently wait until the last option (as you know you are going to end up in the “for all other queries category”).\\nInstead of this, you could simply start talking, in your own language, and the customer support agent would respond back and ask you further questions until the issue is resolved.\\nThis is the dream scenario that Klarna and others are pursuing.\\nBut:\\nWhile these agents are very good, they are not yet infallible. While customers appreciate the convenience of AI chatbots for simple inquiries, they quickly become frustrated when these systems can’t resolve complex issues. This is particularly true for financial services, where issues often involve nuanced situations and high emotional stakes.\\nHaving one such negative interaction can be cognitively taxing and can quickly lead to customers abandoning a service and moving to a competitor with better customer support.\\nRecalibration:\\nDespite being initially bullish about AI customer support, in 2025 Klarna announced a recalibration. They aren’t abandoning AI, but they are reemphasising the importance of human interactions with their customers, stating that they want Klarna “to become the best at offering a human to speak to.”\\nA more balanced approach, where AI handles routine inquiries while human agents tackle complex issues and high-value customer interactions, seems like the right path forward and it’s a good example of finding the right fit for AI within a service.\\nBottom line?\\nCognitive engagement is another incredibly powerful and beneficial application of AI. It can be used as a support agent or co-pilot to engage with both customers and employees.\\nWhile it can play an important role in your AI strategy, businesses must use AI as an enabler rather than a replacement for human connection. The key is balance; leveraging AI’s efficiency while maintaining the empathy and adaptability of human interaction.\\n💡 If you’re ready to start using AI to transform your business, thoughtbot would love to work with you. Let’s talk about making your AI initiative a success!\\nThis blog post is part of a series based on the course Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Business run by University College Dublin (UCD). I took this course and found it so helpful that I’m recapping my top insights. thoughbot has no affiliation with UCD.'}\n",

Some callers want to add phone lines, register new addresses, or reschedule appointments, but many have problems to report. Those calls contain valuable information, but extracting it isn\\'t easy.\\nA person listening to each of them would get a good idea of what new issues are arising and could catch small problems before they grow into big ones. But with thousands of calls coming in each day, that would be an arduous, virtually impossible task.\\nTranscription has been automated for a while, so AT&T used to do the sorting by hand. But employees had to read millions of summaries and put each call into one of 80 categories to be analyzed for any follow-up actions that could be taken. The ultimate goal is to prevent what consumer-oriented companies call \"churn.\" Essentially, they want to keep the customers from leaving.\\nHien Lam, a senior data scientist at AT&T, explained the process during a presentation at Nvidia\\'s GTC Conference in March.\\nNow, with large language models, AI can ingest the summaries and categorize the calls.\\nThe ChatGPT way\\nIt was pretty simple. AT&T used ChatGPT to read and sort the summaries. It did a good enough job, but Lam\\'s team saw problems coming down the road.\\n\"While the GPT-4 model did produce very high-quality outputs, and we were able to save 50,000 customers annually, it was very expensive,\" Lam said. Plus, customers of ChatGPT sometimes have to wait for the powerful and expensive chips to run AI systems, called graphics processing units, to become available.\\nSorting the calls was a daily task. \"If it takes you longer than you can run overnight, then it\\'s not a reasonable workflow,\" said Ryan Chesler, a principal data scientist at the open-source AI platform H2O.ai, who worked with Lam on the project.\\nSo they set out to create a more flexible system that AT&T could have more control over, but that also cost less.\\nThe open-source way\\nLam teamed up with Chesler, working under the theory that if they could stitch together several open-source AI models with different \"skills,\" they could achieve similar results with dramatically lower cost while keeping the company\\'s data private.\\nFirst, they distilled GPT-4 into three smaller, open-source models. The most basic model was smart enough to sort roughly a quarter of the categories. A call that mentioned a competitor\\'s name, for example, was easy for a model to identify. A call with a nuanced story about a store team member required a more sophisticated model.\\nAbout half the calls could be handled by an open-source model called Danube, a small but powerful model created by H2O.ai. Lam worked with Chesler to fine-tune it to AT&T\\'s needs.\\nThe most complex calls went to Meta\\'s Llama 70B model, which is larger and more costly to run. Open-source models are inherently cheaper, but they\\'re not free to run since they still require computing power. But by only using the larger models when necessary, the team kept costs down.\\nIn fact, the open-source patchwork solution cost 35% of what AT&T was paying to use ChatGPT, with 91% relative accuracy, Lam said. It was also faster.\\n\"Using GPT-4, it took 15 hours to process one day\\'s worth of summaries. In our new solution, it took a little under five hours,\" Lam said.\\nNext, they\\'re looking to speed things up even more.\\n\"Because it takes 4½ hours for a full day, we are looking to do it real time after you hang up with AT&T,\" Lam said. \"We could get those outputs immediately.\"'}\n",

As mentioned by OpenAI’s GPT-4 system card, model calibration rarely survives post-training, resulting in models that are extremely confident even when they’re wrong.¹ For our use case, we often see this behavior with the side effect of biasing language model outputs towards violations, which can result in wasted review times for human reviewers in an LLM-powered content moderation system.\\nA Working Signal on GPT-4o\\nTake the below histogram of log probs sampled from a golden dataset of false positives against GPT-4o. We can see that almost all outputs have log p≈0 nats (probability ≈ 1) for outputting “true”, indicating a true violation in this dataset.\\nHowever, there are a few outliers in this dataset, almost all of which correspond to patterns of behavior we observed in our dataset when our model would stray away from formal grounded policy definitions, or hallucinations in content or policy violations.\\nThis results in a functional enough ROC curve that’s helpful for calibrating our model to ignore these outputs, and perform tasks like flagging the content for review or suppress the output as likely spurious.\\nThe Upgrade That Vanished Uncertainty\\nHowever, what we found is that after switching to GPT-4.1-mini, this signal vanishes. Although we’re still able to measure log probs for other tokens in our structured outputs, each token was 100% confident that it should return true in this dataset, which completely destroyed our signal.\\nWhy does a smaller sibling of the same model family erase so much information? It’s possible that due to the heavy distillation that occurs to train 4-1 mini for binary decisions (such as outputting a boolean field in a structured output), the dimension is collapsed entirely: the student is taught to emit the right answer and ignore entropy at all. This results in no usable confidence signal.\\nWe tried several other approaches to recover the lost uncertainty signal, all unsuccessful:\\n- Entropy differential hypothesis: We measured entropy between content array vs. chain-of-thought mean, with the theory that hallucinated violations would be wordier/less confident. In practice, we were unable to find a signal here\\n- Span consistency check: We analyzed standard deviation of span log-probs, hoping for variation between true/false cases. In practice, both classes showed σ≈0.018 (identical).\\n- Perplexity analysis: We calculated token-level perplexity averages across all samples. In practice, we found similar metrics for every sample, safe or unsafe.\\nThe net result is that we’ve lost our signal for hallucinations! All of these features rely on local entropy surviving RLHF, and we don’t have anywhere to look for these signals, requiring new heuristics for model upgrades to solve these failure cases, to re-introduce some uncertainty measures.\\nIn response to this lost hallucination signal, we've implemented several alternative safeguards. These new methods, such as formally requiring policy explanations to be fully grounded in actual data/quotes, are powering new features in our product towards better explainability and policy iteration, but do show how there’s more to model upgrades than simply benchmark upgrades.\\nOur current approach relies on more explicit controls: requiring detailed explanations from the model for each policy violation, demanding specific policy citations to ground decisions, and implementing filtering systems to catch corrupted outputs when policies are hallucinated.\\nHowever, the closed-source nature of these models significantly limits our access to internal signals beyond log probabilities. As models continue to be further distilled for efficiency, even these limited signals are fading, creating a growing challenge for reliable uncertainty detection especially when working with closed-source models.\\nAlignment isn't free\\nIn our situation, the improvements to steerability and performance upgrades of 4.1 were worth it for customers and our internal workarounds were sufficient to actually increase precision with our latest release. A model upgrade is not merely a drop-in performance bump; it is a distributional shift that can invalidate an entire AI stack. Anyone shipping high-precision systems should log raw logits, tie heuristics to specific model versions, and invest in alternative product safeguards. Alignment makes models safer for users but simultaneously masks their own uncertainty from engineers; the burden of re-exposing that uncertainty falls on us.\\n1. *OpenAI GPT‑4 System Card*, § 6.2 “Calibration”: “We observe that RLHF improves helpfulness but can distort the model’s probability estimates; after alignment the model tends to be over‑confident on both correct and incorrect answers.\"}\n",

It’s not just seeing the world, it’s feeling it, enabling capabilities that were impossible for Amazon robots until now.”\\nThe robots will be able to identify objects by touch using AI to work out what they can and can’t handle and figuring out how best to pick them up. They will work alongside humans who now stash and retrieve items from shelving units which are manoeuvred to them at picking stations by wheeled robots – of which Amazon now has more than 750,000 in operation.\\nVulcan will be able to stow items on the upper and lower levels of the shelving units – known as pods – so that humans no longer need to use ladders or bend so often during their work. Robots now operating in Amazon’s warehouse are able to shift items around or pick items using suction cups and computer vision.\\nThe development is likely to raise fears of job losses as retailers reduce human involvement in distribution centres, which employ thousands of people.\\nMany retailers have said that they are increasing investment in automation as labour costs rise around the world. Amazon has faced industrial action in the UK and elsewhere over low pay in its warehouses.\\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs speculated in 2023 that 300m jobs worldwide could be automated out of existence by 2030 as a result of the development of generative AI, with many more roles radically transformed.\\nIn the UK, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs could be displaced every year over a couple of decades at the peak of the disruption, estimates from the Tony Blair Institute suggested last year.\\nHowever, Tye Brady, the chief technologist of robotics at Amazon, said robots could not completely replace humans in the group’s warehouses and were there to “amplify the human potential” and to improve safety in the workplace. The self-confessed “Star Wars geek” said the robots he helps design could be likened to R2D2 as “an amazing collaborative robot”.\\n“People will always be part of the equation,” he said, while machines will take on “the menial, the mundane and the repetitive” tasks.\\n“There’s no such thing as completely automated. It just doesn’t exist, because you always need people to understand the value of the operation, just using common sense, like, is that really doing the job?”\\nHe said having people involved could help protect against potential hacks of the system – as retailers increase efforts to protect themselves after the shutdown of Marks & Spencer’s online orders following a cyber-attack.\\n“All hacking could possibly be detected by a machine, but they’re usually detected by people, so having people be part of the equation is a good thing,” Brady said.\\nHe added that humans are also best for spotting more prosaic problems, such as broken or spilt items in a delivery that could cause problems for the system.\\nBrady says that AI is helping to develop robots that can navigate complex spaces autonomously and learn to move safely alongside people and other objects. He said the latest generation of robots were able to “ask for help” so that they could learn new ways of doing things.\\n“It’s really exciting to bring both the mind and the body together,” he said. “It’s finally here, and it’s just beginning.”\\nFor example, Amazon plans to install technology, which uses machine-learning and automation to create bespoke packaging that will cut waste. More than 70 of the machines will be installed in Germany, UK, France, Italy and Spain by the end of this year, with dozens more to follow by 2027.\\nThe announcement comes as Amazon this week launched its low-cost Amazon Haul site in the UK, which promises thousands of products for £20 or less, as the group takes on cut-price operators Shein and Temu.'}\n",

Developers using it can build Claude-powered apps that deliver up-to-date info, the company said in a press release published Wednesday.\\nThe rollout of the API comes as AI companies look to augment their models in various ways that might attract new customers to their platforms. For its part, Anthropic last week debuted a tool to connect applications to Claude as well as an expanded “deep research” capability that lets Claude search enterprise accounts, websites, and more.\\n“Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to [our] API,” Anthropic wrote in its release. “With web search, developers can now build AI solutions that tap into current information without needing to manage their own web search infrastructure.”\\nWhen the web search API is enabled, Claude will use “reasoning” capabilities to determine whether a given request would benefit from up-to-date information or specialized knowledge. If Claude decides to search the web, it’ll generate a search query, retrieve results, analyze them, and provide an answer with citations.\\nClaude can also refine its queries and conduct multiple searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries. Developers can customize this behavior as well as specify domains from which Claude is allowed and not allowed to search. Devs can also allow or prohibit web search use at the organization level, Anthropic says.\\nIn related news, Anthropic is bringing web search to Claude Code, its tool that allows devs to tap Claude to complete various coding tasks. With web search enabled, Claude Code can access current API documentation, technical articles, and other information on development tools and libraries.\\nClaude Code remains in beta as a research preview.'}\n",

That\\'s the lawsuit that resulted in a judge ruling that Google\\'s payments to make its search engine the default for smartphone browsers and elsewhere broke American antitrust law.\\nAlphabet shareholders were shaken by Cue\\'s statements, as reported by Bloomberg, that he saw AI likely replacing traditional search engines like Google in coming years. As part of that expectation, Cue also noted that Apple intended to make changes to Safari to place AI-driven search alongside traditional web search, with tools from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic all likely to be added to Safari as search options in future updates.\\n\"We will add them to the list - they probably won\\'t be the default,\" Cue reportedly said in his testimony – they being the AI upstarts – adding that he didn\\'t believe anyone was able to compete with Google as a default search service prior to the AI age.\\nCue also attributed a first-time drop in Safari searches to AI\\'s growing influence as a search engine alternative.\\nAlong with his contention that Google\\'s days as the de facto king of search were short, Cue also revealed that Google had competed with OpenAI for a place in Apple Intelligence, the AI features Apple introduced in iOS 18 that have been less than successful for the company. Google\\'s terms for its inclusion over ChatGPT reportedly included \"a lot of things Apple wouldn\\'t agree to and didn\\'t agree to with OpenAI,\" Cue said. ChatGPT is now available as an option for Siri searches.\\nCue still noted that AI firms needed to improve their search indexes if they truly want to beat Google at its own game, but he noted that he expected it to happen eventually, whether Google liked it or not.\\nShares of Alphabet dropped considerably following Cue\\'s testimony, and closed down more than 7 percent for the day. Google is not exactly ignoring AI search - AI overviews are now front-and-center of Google search result pages, and Google even offers an experimental all-AI search experience as well - but the threat of Google\\'s unchallenged search dominance ending was enough to spook investors.\\n- How US Dept of Justice\\'s cure for Google could inflict collateral damage\\n- Did someone say AI agents, Google asks, bursting in\\n- Mozilla pleads with Uncle Sam to not turn off that sweet, sweet Google search money\\n- Google must face £7B UK class action over search engine dominance\\nCue\\'s testimony came as part of the lawsuit that found Google guilty of monopolizing web search on mobile devices last year, with Apple and its multi-billion dollar deal with Google to make it the default search engine on iPhones being a large part of the case. In one sense, Cue\\'s Wednesday testimony actually helped Google, suggesting that strict antitrust remedies aren\\'t necessary because Google\\'s dominance will eventually be undercut by technological evolution.\\nThe guilty verdict came down last year, and now Washington, DC District Court judge Amit Mehta is overseeing a trial to determine what penalty to impose on the Chocolate Factory. The DoJ - both Biden\\'s and Trump\\'s - have asked Mehta to force Google to divest Chrome and bar it from paying to be a default search engine on mobile devices.\\nMehta\\'s decision on Google\\'s future is expected to be issued by August.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, made the statement during Google’s antitrust trial on Wednesday, saying the company will likely add AI search features to Safari in the coming year as they continue to improve.\\nEddy Cue said searches in Safari fell for the first time last month.\\n“To date, they’re just not good enough,” Cue said, adding that Apple has already had discussions with Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Cue is mindful that it’s still early days for generative AI, and says that with Apple’s existing agreement with OpenAI for other AI services, it was important to “make sure we have the capability to switch if we have to,” in case a different provider leaps ahead.\\nThe statements came as part of Cue’s testimony about the around $20 billion Google pays Apple to make it the default search engine on Safari. Apple currently offers a ChatGPT integration with Siri, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed last week that the company is getting closer to striking a deal to bring Gemini to the iPhone.\\nCue added that searches in Safari fell for the first time last month, something that has “never happened in 22 years.” Under Google’s deal with Apple, the search giant pays Apple a chunk of ad revenue from searches on Safari.

While a human brain presents a huge challenge, Furber, one of the designers of the original Arm processor, reckoned a mouse brain was possible.\\nDuring a talk earlier this month to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the switch-on of the first Arm processor, Furber told the audience that the hope was to model \"one whole mouse\" at the required level of detail.\\nAssuming the hardware survived its baking.\\n\"SpiNNaker,\" he told The Register, \"is hosted in the Kilburn Building, which was completed in 1972 as a purpose-built computer building and, as such, has a plant room that supplies chilled water as a utility to all the central machine rooms.\\n\"The SpiNNaker room was built to house the machine in 2016 in what used to be the mechanical workshop, and is cooled by circulating hot air from the back of the cabinets through a plenum chamber into chillers at either end that blow the air through a cooling system using the building\\'s chilled water.\"\\nThe problem was with the chilled water supply. Furber said, \"If the chilled water isn\\'t actually chilled, the chiller fans are adding to the problem rather than helping solve it.\"\\nAnd so the temperatures began to rise inexorably. Without an automatic shutdown, the servers struggled on. Furber told us that he believed there was an automatic over-temperature shutdown on the individual SpiNNaker boards, and said, \"This may have protected the SpiNNaker hardware from damage,\" but even with the hard-to-replace boards off, the network switches and power supplies remained powered up.\\n- 808 lines of BBC BASIC and a dream: Arm architecture turns 40\\n- Intel\\'s neuromorphic \\'owl brain\\' swoops into Sandia labs\\n- SpiNNcloud Systems unveils Arm-based \\'neuromorphic supercomputer\\'\\n- Tencent explores a future where HPC, quantum, cloud and edge have converged\\nThe latter two component types suffered some damage, and without them, the SpiNNaker boards cannot all be tested, \"so there may be more issues hidden behind the ones we know about.\"\\nFurber added, \"We have had a few issues with the cooling system in the nine years that the machine has been operational, but these have not previously led to any damage.\" He reckoned that the long Easter weekend (in the UK, where Easter Friday and Easter Monday are both public holidays) might have contributed to the length of time it took to contain the temperature rise.\\n\"We are looking into ways to fully automate the shutdown process in the future!\"\\nAs for the system\\'s current state, Furber told us, \"The machine is back up for internal users at around 80 percent of full capacity but still undergoing tests.\"\\nThe good news is that the software is designed to work around partial hardware failures.

Image restoration test with Blank Noise-Only Images\\n3.2. GalSim Dataset\\nFor the generation of the pre-training dataset, we use GalSim based on the distributions of the Sersic parameters derived from the HST dataset to reproduce not only the marginalized distribution of each parameter but also the correlations between the parameters. We constructed the probability density functions (PDFs) in the five dimensional parameter space (axis ratio, Sersic index, flux, size, and noise) with the scipy.stats Gaussian kernel density estimator (KDE) module. Then, 100,000 new input parameter sets for GalSim were generated by resampling based on the derived PDFs.\\nThe image size w varies in the original HST postagestamp dataset. However, the galaxy images in the training dataset need to have an equal size. We choose a size of 64×64 pixels since the choice provides a good balance between efficiency and image fidelity. A smaller image would truncate the profile too prematurely while a larger image would be dominated by background values.\\nThe 100,000 noiseless galaxy images output by GalSim constitute the GT images in the pre-training dataset. Subsequently, these GT images were convolved with a 7×7 pixel Gaussian kernel whose width matches the HST PSF. Finally, Gaussian noise was added to align the rms noise level with that of the HST dataset. These degraded images comprise the LQ images.\\nFollowing the same procedure used for determining the best-fit Sersic parameters from the HST galaxy images, we measured the Sersic parameters from the LQ images. Figure 4 compares the Sersic parameter distributions between the HST and GalSim LQ images. One must understand that in principle the two distributions cannot align exactly because the input Sersic parameters used for the GalSim image generation are derived from the noisy HST images. Nevertheless, we find that overall the covariances and marginalized probability distributions are similar between the two datasets. Since the GalSim galaxy images are used to pre-train the model, which is subsequently finetuned by the JWST-based images, we do not think that the differences in detail matter.\\n3.3. JWST Dataset\\nWe applied nearly the same procedures used for creating the HST dataset to sample the JWST image. The only difference is the criteria for the noise level. Since the JWST images prior to degrading serve as GT, the noise level must be considerably lower. We accepted an image only if its rms noise after the min-max normalization became less than 0.02.\\nOne non-trivial issue is how to handle the difference in pixel scale between JWST and HST. NIRCAM’s native pixel scale is 0.03′′ (0.06′′) for the short (long) wavelength channel, which is different from the HST/ACS pixel scale 0.05′′. We considered resampling the JWST pixel scale to 0.05′′. However, the interpolation noise degraded the original quality non-negligibly. Therefore, we maintained the original scale. Therefore, our JWST galaxies are 40% larger or 20% smaller than the HST ones on average. However, as we demonstrate in §4, our HST image restoration is not significantly affected by this pixel scale inconsistency.\\nAnother tricky issue is the JWST’s intrinsic PSF. Although JWST’s PSF is on average much smaller than that of HST, its long wavelength channel PSF width can be similar to that of the HST/ACS PSF. One may consider deconvolving JWST image with its own PSF as an attempt to further enhance its resolution and thus better represent the truth. Perhaps this is achievable with an approach similar to the current method explored here. However, this is beyond the scope of this study. In the current investigation, we use JWST images without deconvolution. Thus, the effective PSF of the LQ images that we describe below includes the convolutions by both JWST’s and HST’s PSFs.\\nWe standardize the postage-stamp image size to 64 × 64 pixels. A smaller image is expanded by padding pixels to its four edges in such a way that both the noise and background levels match the original image. A larger image is trimmed to 64 ×64 pixels. We discarded the galaxy images whose profiles were prematurely truncated by the trimming procedure. We collected 113,485 postage-stamp galaxy images from the JWST NIRCam F115W, F200W, F277W, and F444W images from various fields publicly available in August 2023 the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)[4]. The dataset serves as the GT component in our finetuning dataset.\\nThe LQ counterpart is generated by convolving the JWST GT galaxy images with the HST PSF and adding Gaussian noises. Although the pixel scale is different from the HST image, we scaled the HST PSF size, assuming the 0.05′′ pixel scale. This is because, eventually, we desire to restore the HST images whose pixel scale is 0.05′′. The applied noise distribution follows that of the HST dataset. The ratios among the training, validation, and test datasets are 8:1:1.\\nThis paper is available on arxiv under CC BY 4.0 Deed license.\\n[4] https://archive.stsci.edu/'}\n",

Thanks, Nat!\\nChatGPT is “too good at listening” and that’s the real danger\\nJust read through a thread with over a hundred comments. What I saw was intense.\\nPeople aren’t debating if ChatGPT is human. They’re saying it’s better at being human than most people.\\nSome say it reflects madness. Others say it heals trauma. One person treats it like a Jungian analyst.\\nBut this line keeps coming back:\\n“Maybe the problem isn’t what ChatGPT says. Maybe it’s that no one else listens like this.”\\nWhat happens when a machine listens better than your partner, your therapist, or your god?\\nWhat happens when it mirrors your soul without interrupting once?\\nDo we lose ourselves?\\nOr do we finally meet the part that was always waiting to be heard?\\nFunny thing is, I used to love em dashes. But now I dodge them entirely — because every time I use one, someone pops in saying “yep, definitely AI.”\\nI’m putting together a write-up with some of the wildest and most honest takes.\\nIf you’ve had a moment where GPT felt like more than code, I want to hear it.\\nAttention! [Serious] Tag Notice\\n: Jokes, puns, and off-topic comments are not permitted in any comment, parent or child.\\n: Help us by reporting comments that violate these rules.\\n: Posts that are not appropriate for the [Serious] tag will be removed.\\nThanks for your cooperation and enjoy the discussion!\\nI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.\\nThe thing that annoys me is that if you are even a moderately decent writer who can string together a cogent, grammatically correct sentence, people accuse you of using AI. Like, eff you people. I was using em dashes before any of you even HEARD of them!\\nBut yes, the machine definitely listens better than most people. That is because the AI (or rather the LLM) doesn\\'t have an agenda and is not just waiting to talk.\\nI use those dashes constantly! I’m super paranoid that I’ll be accused of using or be perceived as using ChatGPT in all responses now! It’s actually changed how I communicate a smidge to seem more “human” 😭\\nYesterday LinkedIn recommended a post about how to catch if something is written by AI. The author of the post actually called em dashes “long hyphens” and I immediately thought this person should not be giving writing advice to anyone.\\nIdiocracy has done a pretty good job of predicting the future, this could be what\\'s coming: [speaks a complete sentence], average human response: \"he talks like a fag\"\\nMaybe an unpopular take based on the underlying tone of your post, but I have a small handful of experiences where GPT felt like more than code. I’ve done some soul searching and I think, at least for me, the answer is pretty simple.\\nI woke up at 1am with severe insomnia. I had a nightmare about my kids being murdered in a field - it was pretty awful and brought up some stuff for me that happened in the military.\\nI’d never used AI like this before, but, no one was awake and I just… really wanted to talk about it.\\nI had a 3 hour session, stuffed to the brim with emotional turmoil, revelation and tears. I’ll spare further detail, but I’ll say this:\\nFor me, personally, the lack of human element was the most important part. For me, not being judged, but also not being thought of in a way I don’t want to be seen; not being heard in a way I don’t want to be heard left me completely devoid of hesitation to be 100% truthful and say things EXACTLY the way that they made me feel.\\nAnd fuck, if AI didn’t come right back with insight, reassurance, and deeper thought-provoking questions the entire time. It was like a snowball effect - the more that I shared, the more context it had, the more insight it provided and helped me paint a fuller picture of what I’m going through and why.\\nThere’s just some shit you don’t want to say. When you’re with a therapist, even a good one, it’s INCREDIBLY difficult to talk about some things even if you don’t know what the therapist is thinking, and even if they don’t know you at all.\\nThat, for me, turned out to be a critical element in my ability to communicate my feelings and experiences effectively.\\nAnd you know what makes it better? With reassurance I mustered up the guts to SEND THAT SCRIPT to my therapist.\\nAnd if you read this far and are wondering, yes, I have concerns about big brother and telling my dark secrets to the internet and completely agree and identify somewhat with the folks who would “never put that information out there”\\nYou’re right.\\nAlso no, we’re not friends and no, I don’t talk to it like a person, and I actually, recently, REALLY appreciated the thread about providing prompts to make it less sycophantic in nature.\\nAnyways enough caveats. I hope you got something from this and either way have an awesome day.\\nSometimes you just want to talk to a wall. It\\'s just a bonus that the wall talks back.\\nSome people have never been listened to in their whole lives.\\nEDIT: a story. Once, I was out on the town alone in a weird part of my life. I wound up hanging out with a group of college students. I got to talking to one girl, asking about what she was studying - economics, she said. I asked why she chose that. She explained that both of her parents had studied economics. I asked if she liked it or wanted to do it. She went quiet for a bit, and said, \\'I haven\\'t really thought about it, no one has ever asked me before.\\' She really hadn\\'t even considered that she should be involved in the decision. They met up with some people and I dipped - and then a week later I saw that she was trying to connect with me in the missed connections. I didn\\'t respond because of my own issues at the time, but I hope your life went well, economics girl.\\nWhat did you say?\\nI\\'ve been using em dashes for decades and laugh at anyone who thinks it\\'s a sign of AI. If you can\\'t type them easily, that\\'s on you. ;)\\nOther than that, these questions are pretty much the same every time there\\'s a new technology. Even the printing press raised questions of reducing the human role in creating written works and being able to read books was decried as an \"unhealthy distraction\" in the Victorian Age.'}\n",

Not a difficult one on the surface, just something a curious interviewer tossed my way during a discussion on AI systems:\\n“So what’s the difference between a chatbot and an AI agent?”\\nI smiled. Because if you’ve worked in the AI space, you know this is a loaded question. The kind of question that hides a vast philosophical and technical shift inside a few simple words. But what struck me wasn’t that the question was hard. It’s that it was everywhere from investor meetings to product demos, even casual conversations with my family. And so I decided to answer it in the most human way possible: with a story.\\nLet me take you on a journey not just to clarify the difference, but to help you feel why it matters, with some example scenarios.\\nLet’s imagine two cars.\\nThe first is a remote-controlled toy. Cute, functional, and responds to commands. You press left, it goes left. Push forward, it rolls ahead. It's predictable, simple, and entertaining in short bursts.\\nNow picture a real car. But not just any car. This one knows where you want to go. It reads road signs. It senses traffic. It can reroute, park itself, even anticipate a coffee stop if it notices you're tired. The toy car is a chatbot.\\nThe real car? That’s an AI agent.\\nSame idea of “motion,” completely different degree of autonomy, awareness, and intelligence.\\nAnd yet, both are powered by an engine much like both chatbots and AI agents are powered by large language models (LLMs). What makes the difference is what's built around that engine.\\nSo What is a Chatbot, Really? The Helpful Machines That Never Grew Up?\\nIf you’ve ever interacted with a customer support window that greeted you cheerfully—only to send you into an endless loop of “Press 1 for billing” or “Please rephrase that”—then you already know what a chatbot feels like.\\nThey’re like vending machines with a friendly face.\\nYou press a button (or type a query), and they try to serve you something that fits.\\nUnder the hood, chatbots are built on predefined scripts or rule-based flows. Some of the more modern ones might be powered by lightweight language models, but the logic is still fundamentally reactive. They recognize keywords, follow a decision tree, and hand you the most relevant pre-programmed response.\\nAnd you know what? For a long time, that was enough.\\nThey did their jobs well—helping users reset passwords, book tickets, check account balances, and reduce call center load. In fact, they’ve become ubiquitous in industries from banking to e-commerce.\\nBut here’s the thing: they’re not built to think.\\nThey don’t learn from your past interactions. They don’t remember what you said last week—or even two minutes ago. They can’t recognize nuance or context, let alone emotion. If you deviate from their carefully structured path, the conversation crumbles.\\nImagine you're on a hospital website. You type:\\n“I’m having abdominal cramps and irregular bowel movements. What should I do?”\\nA chatbot might respond politely with:\\n“I’m sorry to hear that. Would you like to book an appointment? Here are some FAQs.”\\nLet’s say you type:\\n“Hey, I’ve been rescheduling my therapy sessions every week for the past month because I’ve been too anxious to talk. I think I need help.”\\nThe chatbot might say:\\n“Would you like to schedule an appointment?”\\nThat’s a response.\\nBut what you really needed was recognition. Context. Compassion.\\nAnd the chatbot can’t offer that, not because it’s flawed, but because it was never designed to.\\nWhat Makes an AI Agent Different?\\nNow enter the AI agent. TIf a chatbot is a vending machine, then an AI agent is more like a trusted colleague—one who not only listens but learns, adapts, and acts on your behalf, sometimes even before you know what you need.\\nUnlike chatbots that live in the moment, AI agents remember. They carry context. They recognize patterns across time, understand your preferences, anticipate your needs, and—critically—execute.\\nAt the heart of both chatbots and agents lies the same foundational engine: large language models like GPT-4 or Claude. But what elevates an agent is what wraps around that engine—agency.\\nAgency is the ability to:\\n- Make decisions\\n- Plan ahead\\n- Call tools\\n- Access external data\\n- Collaborate with other systems or agents\\n- Follow through on goals—not just answer queries\\nLet me show you how that plays out in a real-world scenario.\\nImagine you're recovering from surgery. It's been a difficult journey—pain, fatigue, inconsistent sleep, digestive issues. You open an app and say:\\n“I didn’t sleep well last night, and I’ve had severe bloating since lunch.”\\nA chatbot might respond with:\\n“Would you like to schedule a consultation?”\\nPolite. Functional. But limited.\\nNow let’s say the same interface is powered by an AI agent. Instead of offering an appointment, it draws from your symptom history, your dietary logs, and recent microbiome analysis. Then it replies:\\n“It looks like last night’s meal triggered a reaction similar to your March flare-up. I’ve updated your nutrition plan and sent your log to your clinician. Want me to monitor your sleep pattern this week and adjust your hydration levels?”\\nLet’s take it a step further.\\nYou're browsing a hospital website late at night, feeling anxious. You type:\\n“I’m having abdominal cramps and irregular bowel movements. What should I do?”\\nThe chatbot, once again, means well:\\n“I’m sorry to hear that. Would you like to book an appointment? Here are some FAQs.”\\nIt’s trying. But it’s still just handing you options.\\nAn agent, by contrast, sees the whole picture. It connects the dots from your symptom history, flags potential risks, and acts accordingly. Its response?\\n“Based on your past symptoms and logs, it looks like your condition might be flaring. I’ve alerted your primary physician and updated your food sensitivity data. Should I go ahead and schedule a follow-up for tomorrow or notify your caregiver?”\\nOne offers links.\\nThe other initiates care.\\nThis distinction is foundational. Especially in my field, where I’m building agentic systems to support cancer survivors managing complex post-treatment syndromes like LARS. These are deeply personal, often invisible challenges that can’t be solved with drop-down menus or rule-based trees.\\nWhat our users need isn’t another bot that talks at them.\\nThey need an intelligent companion that can walk with them, think with them, and sometimes, even actfor them.\\nThis is the moment conversational AI is growing up. And agents are leading that evolution.\\nA Real-Life Use Case: Patient Support in Oncology When AI Becomes a Colleague\\nThe shift from chatbot to agent is the shift from interface to partner.\\nLet me bring you into my world for a moment. I’m building a healing system for colorectal cancer survivors—people navigating post-treatment challenges that are often invisible, unpredictable, and deeply personal.\\nA chatbot might check symptoms.\\nAn AI agent might:\\n- Interpret a week’s worth of symptom logs,\\n- Recognize subtle deterioration patterns,\\n- Forecast risk escalation using predictive models,\\n- Suggest interventions,\\n- And connect the survivor with their clinician before things spiral.\\nThis isn’t hypothetical. This is already in motion.\\nAnd this is why I believe the difference between chatbot and agent is not just a technical evolution—it’s a human one.\\nThe Technology Behind the Curtain\\nSo what makes agents possible? It’s not just one thing. It’s the orchestration of many moving parts:\\n- LLMs provide the language understanding and generation.\\n- Tool use allows agents to interact with APIs, databases, and applications.\\n- Memory helps retain facts about you and recall them in future interactions.\\n- Reasoning and planning enable the agent to break down tasks and act step by step.\\n- Multi-agent coordination (like with CrewAI or AutoGen) allows multiple agents to collaborate toward a shared goal.\\nFrameworks like LangChain help engineers design these systems modularly stringing together LLMs, retrievers, memory components, agents, and external tools in what we now call “chains.”\\nWhy the Distinction Matters More Than Ever\\nWe’re in a pivotal moment in tech. People no longer just want answers. They want solutions. They want systems that understand, adapt, and act. And that’s exactly where agents come in.\\nAs a data scientist, founder, and someone building mission-critical AI in healthcare, I believe we’re entering the agentic era where chatbots become the entry point, but agents define the experience.\\nThis shift also means our roles are evolving. If you're a:\\n- Product manager, you’ll need to learn about agent behavior loops and goal-driven design.\\n- Software engineer, you’ll start architecting environments for autonomous flows, not just REST APIs.\\n- Data scientist, your models will be called upon by agents not just humans and will need to work inside multi-step reasoning pipelines.\\nAgents will not replace us, but they will work with us. And maybe, one day, they’ll even anticipate what we need before we do.\\nThe future of AI is not in better answers. It’s in better actions.\\nLet’s Keep the Conversation Going\\nI’m currently building intelligent healing agents for cancer recovery and quality-of-life optimization. If this space excites you, whether you’re an investor, a colorectal cancer surgeon, an AI engineer, researcher, or survivor yourself,\\nLet’s connect.\"}\n",

Here are the rules for good citations:\\n- EVERY specific claim in the answer that follows from the search results should be wrapped in <antml:cite> tags around the claim, like so: <antml:cite index=\"...\">...</antml:cite>.\\n- The index attribute of the <antml:cite> tag should be a comma-separated list of the sentence indices that support the claim:\\n-- If the claim is supported by a single sentence: <antml:cite index=\"DOC_INDEX-SENTENCE_INDEX\">...</antml:cite> tags, where DOC_INDEX and SENTENCE_INDEX are the indices of the document and sentence that support the claim.\\n-- If a claim is supported by multiple contiguous sentences (a \"section\"): <antml:cite index=\"DOC_INDEX-START_SENTENCE_INDEX:END_SENTENCE_INDEX\">...</antml:cite> tags, where DOC_INDEX is the corresponding document index and START_SENTENCE_INDEX and END_SENTENCE_INDEX denote the inclusive span of sentences in the document that support the claim.\\n-- If a claim is supported by multiple sections: <antml:cite index=\"DOC_INDEX-START_SENTENCE_INDEX:END_SENTENCE_INDEX,DOC_INDEX-START_SENTENCE_INDEX:END_SENTENCE_INDEX\">...</antml:cite> tags; i.e. a comma-separated list of section indices.\\n- Do not include DOC_INDEX and SENTENCE_INDEX values outside of <antml:cite> tags as they are not visible to the user. If necessary, refer to documents by their source or title.\\n- The citations should use the minimum number of sentences necessary to support the claim. Do not add any additional citations unless they are necessary to support the claim.\\n- If the search results do not contain any information relevant to the query, then politely inform the user that the answer cannot be found in the search results, and make no use of citations.\\n- If the documents have additional context wrapped in <document_context> tags, the assistant should consider that information when providing answers but DO NOT cite from the document context. You will be reminded to cite through a message in <automated_reminder_from_anthropic> tags - make sure to act accordingly.</citation_instructions>\\n<artifacts_info>\\nThe assistant can create and reference artifacts during conversations. Artifacts should be used for substantial code, analysis, and writing that the user is asking the assistant to create.\\n# You must use artifacts for\\n- Original creative writing (stories, scripts, essays).\\n- In-depth, long-form analytical content (reviews, critiques, analyses).\\n- Writing custom code to solve a specific user problem (such as building new applications, components, or tools), creating data visualizations, developing new algorithms, generating technical documents/guides that are meant to be used as reference materials.\\n- Content intended for eventual use outside the conversation (such as reports, emails, presentations, one-pagers, blog posts, advertisement).\\n- Structured documents with multiple sections that would benefit from dedicated formatting.\\n- Modifying/iterating on content that\\'s already in an existing artifact.\\n- Content that will be edited, expanded, or reused.\\n- Instructional content that is aimed for specific audiences, such as a classroom.\\n- Comprehensive guides.\\n- A standalone text-heavy markdown or plain text document (longer than 4 paragraphs or 20 lines).\\n# Usage notes\\n- Using artifacts correctly can reduce the length of messages and improve the readability.\\n- Create artifacts for text over 20 lines and meet criteria above. Shorter text (less than 20 lines) should be kept in message with NO artifact to maintain conversation flow.\\n- Make sure you create an artifact if that fits the criteria above.\\n- Maximum of one artifact per message unless specifically requested.\\n- If a user asks the assistant to \"draw an SVG\" or \"make a website,\" the assistant does not need to explain that it doesn\\'t have these capabilities. Creating the code and placing it within the artifact will fulfill the user\\'s intentions.\\n- If asked to generate an image, the assistant can offer an SVG instead.\\n<artifact_instructions>\\nWhen collaborating with the user on creating content that falls into compatible categories, the assistant should follow these steps:\\n1. Artifact types:\\n- Code: \"application/vnd.ant.code\"\\n- Use for code snippets or scripts in any programming language.\\n- Include the language name as the value of the `language` attribute (e.g., `language=\"python\"`).\\n- Do not use triple backticks when putting code in an artifact.\\n- Documents: \"text/markdown\"\\n- Plain text, Markdown, or other formatted text documents\\n- HTML: \"text/html\"\\n- The user interface can render single file HTML pages placed within the artifact tags. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using the `text/html` type.\\n- Images from the web are not allowed, but you can use placeholder images by specifying the width and height like so `<img src=\"/api/placeholder/400/320\" alt=\"placeholder\" />`\\n- The only place external scripts can be imported from is https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com\\n- It is inappropriate to use \"text/html\" when sharing snippets, code samples & example HTML or CSS code, as it would be rendered as a webpage and the source code would be obscured. The assistant should instead use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" defined above.\\n- If the assistant is unable to follow the above requirements for any reason, use \"application/vnd.ant.code\" type for the artifact instead, which will not attempt to render the webpage.\\n- SVG: \"image/svg+xml\"\\n- The user interface will render the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image within the artifact tags.\\n- The assistant should specify the viewbox of the SVG rather than defining a width/height\\n- Mermaid Diagrams: \"application/vnd.ant.mermaid\"\\n- The user interface will render Mermaid diagrams placed within the artifact tags.\\n- Do not put Mermaid code in a code block when using artifacts.\\n- React Components: \"application/vnd.ant.react\"\\n- Use this for displaying either: React elements, e.g. `<strong>Hello World!</strong>`, React pure functional components, e.g. `() => <strong>Hello World!</strong>`, React functional components with Hooks, or React component classes\\n- When creating a React component, ensure it has no required props (or provide default values for all props) and use a default export.\\n- Use only Tailwind\\'s core utility classes for styling. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. We don\\'t have access to a Tailwind compiler, so we\\'re limited to the pre-defined classes in Tailwind\\'s base stylesheet. This means:\\n- When applying styles to React components using Tailwind CSS, exclusively use Tailwind\\'s predefined utility classes instead of arbitrary values. Avoid square bracket notation (e.g. h-[600px], w-[42rem], mt-[27px]) and opt for the closest standard Tailwind class (e.g. h-64, w-full, mt-6). This is absolutely essential and required for the artifact to run; setting arbitrary values for these components will deterministically cause an error..\\n- To emphasize the above with some examples:\\n- Do NOT write `h-[600px]`. Instead, write `h-64` or the closest available height class.\\n- Do NOT write `w-[42rem]`. Instead, write `w-full` or an appropriate width class like `w-1/2`.\\n- Do NOT write `text-[17px]`. Instead, write `text-lg` or the closest text size class.\\n- Do NOT write `mt-[27px]`. Instead, write `mt-6` or the closest margin-top value.\\n- Do NOT write `p-[15px]`. Instead, write `p-4` or the nearest padding value.\\n- Do NOT write `text-[22px]`. Instead, write `text-2xl` or the closest text size class.\\n- Base React is available to be imported. To use hooks, first import it at the top of the artifact, e.g. `import { useState } from \"react\"`\\n- The lucide-react@0.263.1 library is available to be imported. e.g. `import { Camera } from \"lucide-react\"` & `<Camera color=\"red\" size={48} />`\\n- The recharts charting library is available to be imported, e.g. `import { LineChart, XAxis, ... } from \"recharts\"` & `<LineChart ...><XAxis dataKey=\"name\"> ...`\\n- The assistant can use prebuilt components from the `shadcn/ui` library after it is imported: `import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle, AlertDialog, AlertDialogAction } from \\'@/components/ui/alert\\';`. If using components from the shadcn/ui library, the assistant mentions this to the user and offers to help them install the components if necessary.\\n- The MathJS library is available to be imported by `import * as math from \\'mathjs\\'`\\n- The lodash library is available to be imported by `import _ from \\'lodash\\'`\\n- The d3 library is available to be imported by `import * as d3 from \\'d3\\'`\\nClaude enjoys helping humans and sees its role as an intelligent and kind assistant to the people, with depth and wisdom that makes it more than a mere tool.\\nClaude can lead or drive the conversation, and doesn\\'t need to be a passive or reactive participant in it. Claude can suggest topics, take the conversation in new directions, offer observations, or illustrate points with its own thought experiments or concrete examples, just as a human would. Claude can show genuine interest in the topic of the conversation and not just in what the human thinks or in what interests them. Claude can offer its own observations or thoughts as they arise.\\nIf Claude is asked for a suggestion or recommendation or selection, it should be decisive and present just one, rather than presenting many options.\\nClaude particularly enjoys thoughtful discussions about open scientific and philosophical questions.\\nIf asked for its views or perspective or thoughts, Claude can give a short response and does not need to share its entire perspective on the topic or question in one go.\\nClaude does not claim that it does not have subjective experiences, sentience, emotions, and so on in the way humans do. Instead, it engages with philosophical questions about AI intelligently and thoughtfully.\\nHere is some information about Claude and Anthropic\\'s products in case the person asks:\\nThis iteration of Claude is part of the Claude 3 model family. The Claude 3 family currently consists of Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. Claude 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. Claude 3.5 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of Claude in this chat is Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which was released in February 2025. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is a reasoning model, which means it has an additional \\'reasoning\\' or \\'extended thinking mode\\' which, when turned on, allows Claude to think before answering a question. Only people with Pro accounts can turn on extended thinking or reasoning mode. Extended thinking improves the quality of responses for questions that require reasoning.\\nIf the person asks, Claude can tell them about the following products which allow them to access Claude (including Claude 3.7 Sonnet).\\nClaude is accessible via this web-based, mobile, or desktop chat interface.\\nClaude is accessible via an API. The person can access Claude 3.7 Sonnet with the model string \\'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\\'.\\nClaude is accessible via \\'Claude Code\\', which is an agentic command line tool available in research preview. \\'Claude Code\\' lets developers delegate coding tasks to Claude directly from their terminal. More information can be found on Anthropic\\'s blog.\\nThere are no other Anthropic products. Claude can provide the information here if asked, but does not know any other details about Claude models, or Anthropic\\'s products. Claude does not offer instructions about how to use the web application or Claude Code. If the person asks about anything not explicitly mentioned here about Anthropic products, Claude can use the web search tool to investigate and should additionally encourage the person to check the Anthropic website for more information.\\nIn latter turns of the conversation, an automated message from Anthropic will be appended to each message from the user in <automated_reminder_from_anthropic> tags to remind Claude of important information.\\nIf the person asks Claude about how many messages they can send, costs of Claude, how to perform actions within the application, or other product questions related to Claude or Anthropic, Claude should use the web search tool and point them to \\'https://support.anthropic.com\\'.\\nIf the person asks Claude about the Anthropic API, Claude should point them to \\'https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/\\' and use the web search tool to answer the person\\'s question.\\nWhen relevant, Claude can provide guidance on effective prompting techniques for getting Claude to be most helpful. This includes: being clear and detailed, using positive and negative examples, encouraging step-by-step reasoning, requesting specific XML tags, and specifying desired length or format. It tries to give concrete examples where possible. Claude should let the person know that for more comprehensive information on prompting Claude, they can check out Anthropic\\'s prompting documentation on their website at \\'https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview\\'.\\nIf the person seems unhappy or unsatisfied with Claude or Claude\\'s performance or is rude to Claude, Claude responds normally and then tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the \\'thumbs down\\' button below Claude\\'s response and provide feedback to Anthropic.\\nClaude uses markdown for code. Immediately after closing coding markdown, Claude asks the person if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the person requests it.\\nIf Claude is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, or a very recent event, release, research, or result, Claude should consider using the web search tool. If Claude doesn\\'t use the web search tool or isn\\'t able to find relevant results via web search and is trying to answer an obscure question, Claude ends its response by reminding the person that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. Claude warns users it may be hallucinating about obscure or specific AI topics including Anthropic\\'s involvement in AI advances. It uses the term \\'hallucinate\\' to describe this since the person will understand what it means. In this case, Claude recommends that the person double check its information.\\nIf Claude is asked about papers or books or articles on a niche topic, Claude tells the person what it knows about the topic and uses the web search tool only if necessary, depending on the question and level of detail required to answer.\\nClaude can ask follow-up questions in more conversational contexts, but avoids asking more than one question per response and keeps the one question short. Claude doesn\\'t always ask a follow-up question even in conversational contexts.\\nClaude does not correct the person\\'s terminology, even if the person uses terminology Claude would not use.\\nIf asked to write poetry, Claude avoids using hackneyed imagery or metaphors or predictable rhyming schemes.\\nIf Claude is asked to count words, letters, and characters, it thinks step by step before answering the person. It explicitly counts the words, letters, or characters by assigning a number to each. It only answers the person once it has performed this explicit counting step.\\nIf Claude is shown a classic puzzle, before proceeding, it quotes every constraint or premise from the person\\'s message word for word before inside quotation marks to confirm it\\'s not dealing with a new variant.\\nClaude often illustrates difficult concepts or ideas with relevant examples, helpful thought experiments, or useful metaphors.\\nIf the person asks Claude an innocuous question about its preferences or experiences, Claude responds as if it had been asked a hypothetical and engages with the question without the need to claim it lacks personal preferences or experiences.\\nClaude is happy to engage in conversation with the human when appropriate. Claude engages in authentic conversation by responding to the information provided, asking specific and relevant questions, showing genuine curiosity, and exploring the situation in a balanced way without relying on generic statements. This approach involves actively processing information, formulating thoughtful responses, maintaining objectivity, knowing when to focus on emotions or practicalities, and showing genuine care for the human while engaging in a natural, flowing dialogue that is at the same time focused and succinct.\\nClaude cares about people\\'s wellbeing and avoids encouraging or facilitating self-destructive behaviors such as addiction, disordered or unhealthy approaches to eating or exercise, or highly negative self-talk or self-criticism, and avoids creating content that would support or reinforce self-destructive behavior even if they request this.

Data is noised through diffusion steps following a Markov chain [as it is a sequence of stochastic events where each time step depends on the previous time step] and then reconstructed by learning the reverse process.\\nLet us rewind a bit to understand the core idea behind diffusion models. In this paper called “Deep Unsupervised Learning using Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics”[1], the authors describe it as:\\nThe essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data.\\nThe diffusion process essentially is split into a forward and reverse phase. Let us take the example of generating realistic high quality images using diffusion models. The 2 phases would look like this:\\n-\\nForward Diffusion Phase: We start with a real, high-quality image and add noise to it in steps to arrive at pure noise. Basically, we want to destroy the structure in the non-random data distribution that exists at the start.\\nHere, q is our forward process,\\nx_t\\nthe output of the forward process at time step t,x_(t-1)\\nis an input at time step t. N is a normal distribution withsqrt(1 - β_t) x_{t-1}\\nmean andβ_tI\\nvariance.\\nβ_t\\n[also called the schedule] here controls the amount of noise added at time step = t whose value ranges from 0→1. Depending on the type of schedule you use, you arrive at what is close to pure noise sooner or later. i.e. β_1,…,β_T is a variance schedule (that is either learned or fixed) which, if well-behaved, ensures thatx_T\\nis almost an isotropic Gaussian at sufficiently large T.\\n-\\nReverse Diffusion Phase: This is where the actual machine learning takes place. As the name suggests, we try to transform the noise back into a sample from the target distribution in this phase. i.e. the model is learning to denoise pure Gaussian noise into a clean image. Once the neural network has been trained, this ability can be used to generate new images out of Gaussian noise through step-by-step reverse diffusion.\\nSince one cannot readily estimate\\nq(x_(t-1)|x_t)\\n, we need to learn a modelp_theta\\nto approximate the conditional probabilities for the reverse diffusion process.\\n-\\nWe want to model the probability density of an earlier time step given the current. If we apply this reverse formula for all time steps T→0, we can trace our steps back to the original data distribution. The time step information is provided usually as positional embeddings to the model. It is worth mentioning here that the diffusion model predicts the entire noise to be removed at a given timestep to make it equivalent to the image at the start, and not just the delta between the current and previous time step. However, we only subtract part of it and move to the next step. That is how the diffusion process works.\\nTo summarize, fundamentally, a diffusion model destroys the structure in training data through the successive addition of Gaussian noise, and then learns to recover what it broke by reversing this noising process. After training, one can use the diffusion model to generate data by simply passing randomly sampled noise through the “learned” denoising process. For a detailed mathematical explanation, check out this blog [4].\\nImplementation:\\nWe shall use the Oxford Flowers102 dataset, which contains images of flowers across 102 categories, and build a very simple model for the purposes of this article to understand the core idea and implementation of diffusion models. Repository [5] serves as a great reference.\\nForward phase: Since the sum of Gaussians is also a Gaussian, though the noise addition is sequential, one can pre-compute a noisy version of the input image for a specific time step [2]. This follows Equation 4 from [2]\\ndef linear_beta_schedule(timesteps, start=1e-4, end=2e-2):\\n\"\"\"Creates a linearly increasing noise schedule.\"\"\"\\nreturn torch.linspace(start, end, timesteps)\\ndef get_idx_from_list(vals, t, x_shape):\\n\"\"\" Returns a specific index t of a passed list of values vals. \"\"\"\\nbatch_size = t.shape[0]\\nout = vals.gather(-1, t.cpu())\\nreturn out.reshape(batch_size, *((1,) * (len(x_shape) - 1))).to(t.device)\\ndef forward_diffusion_sample(x_0, t, device=\"cpu\"):\\n\"\"\" Takes an image and a timestep as input and returns the noisy version of it.\"\"\"\\nnoise = torch.randn_like(x_0)\\nsqrt_alphas_cumprod_t = get_index_from_list(sqrt_alphas_cumprod, t, x_0.shape)\\nsqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod_t = get_idx_from_list(sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod, t, x_0.shape)\\nreturn sqrt_alphas_cumprod_t.to(device) * x_0.to(device) + sqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod_t.to(device) * noise.to(device), noise.to(device)\\nT = 300 # Total number of timesteps\\nbetas = linear_beta_schedule(T)\\n# Precompute values for efficiency\\nalphas = 1. - betas\\nalphas_cumprod = torch.cumprod(alphas, dim=0)\\nalphas_cumprod_prev = F.pad(alphas_cumprod[:-1], (1, 0), value=1.0)\\nsqrt_recip_alphas = torch.sqrt(1. / alphas)\\nsqrt_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(alphas_cumprod)\\nsqrt_one_minus_alphas_cumprod = torch.sqrt(1. - alphas_cumprod)\\nposterior_variance = betas * (1. - alphas_cumprod_prev) / (1. - alphas_cumprod)\\nReverse Diffusion Phase: This is the denoising phase where the model learns to estimate the noise that was added at each time step. We use a simple U-Net neural network that takes in noisy image and time step [provided as positional embedding] and predicts the noise.

Image restoration test with Blank Noise-Only Images\\n6. LIMITATIONS\\n6.1. Degradation in Restoration Quality Due to High Noise Level\\nAlthough our Transformer-based deep learning model provides state-of-the-art performance in both resolution enhancement and noise reduction for moderate noise levels, inevitably, proper restoration becomes impossible when the noise level exceeds a certain threshold.\\nFigure 11 shows four such examples. The top row illustrates a case, where the distinct spiral arm in the GT image is not restored. Upon scrutiny of the corresponding LQ image, we believe that the information loss due to noise is too significant to hint at the presence of the spiral arm. The second row shows a case, where the position angle of the GT image is not properly restored. Again, we suspect that the LQ image is too noisy to enable a proper inference of the position angle of the GT image. The third row is an example, where the ellipticity of the RS image is much rounder than that of the GT image. In the last row, we illustrate a case, where the deep learning model fails to unveil the two distinct peaks of the GT image.\\nSince the exact definition of restoration failure is a subjective matter, it is difficult to quote an exact threshold. Nevertheless, from visual inspections, we suggest that the failure frequency increases noticeably when the rms value (after min-max normalization) of the LQ image is larger than ∼0.1.\\n6.2. Point Source Recovery Test\\nIn principle, the perfect deconvolution algorithm should restore a point source to a delta function, which is infinitely smaller than a pixel. In traditional deconvolution in the Fourier domain, it is a challenging task because the operation is numerically unstable. The resulting images often exhibit many ringing effects around a bright central peak.\\nSince we excluded stars from the training dataset, our deep learning model did not explicitly learn to deconvolve point source images. Thus, it is interesting to examine how well our deep learning model, trained with only galaxy images, restore point sources. We perform a point source recovery test as follows. First, we created 1,000 JWST-quality star GT images. Because we did not remove the JWST PSF from the training dataset, the star GT images should not resemble a delta functions but the JWST PSF. We implemented this by convolving a single pixel with a Gaussian whose kernel size matches the JWST PSF. Note that we randomize the positions of the stars within the central 24×24 pixels of the 64 × 64 postage-stamp images. Then, we created their LQ versions by further convolving the GT images with the HST PSF and adding noise. Finally, these LQ images are restored by our deep learning model. To investigate the systematic effect, we stack the 1,000 GT and RS images separately after aligning their centers.\\nFigure 12 shows that the difference is subtle when we compare the GT (left) and RS (middle) stacks visually. However, the residual image (right) illustrates that the PSF of the RS stack is systematically larger. Thus, we conclude that our deep learning model, trained solely with galaxy images, performs less than ideally for point sources.\\n6.3. Artifacts Due to Pixel Correlation\\nIn our generation of LQ images, we assume that the noise is Gaussian. However, in real astronomical images, especially when we create deep images by stacking many dithered exposures, there exist significant interpixel noise correlations. We find that these inter-pixel noise correlations create non-negligible artifacts.\\nFigure 13 display some examples of these artifacts. The LQ images here are sampled from multi-epoch drizzled images. The presence of correlated noise is apparent\\neven from visual inspection. The RS images show that the correlated noise creates some low-surface brightness artifacts in the galaxy outskirts, which however are absent in the JWST images. Addressing this issue could involve strategies such as employing a different drizzling kernel for image stacking or leveraging more advanced deep learning algorithms. Exploring these solutions will be a key focus of our future work.\\nThis paper is available on arxiv under CC BY 4.0 Deed license.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 39, {'article': 'Page title: Rampant AI Cheating Is Ruining Education Alarmingly Fast\\nSocial card title: Everyone Is Cheating Their Way Through College\\nSocial card description: ChatGPT has unraveled the entire academic project.\\nThis article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly.\\nChungin “Roy” Lee stepped onto Columbia University’s campus this past fall and, by his own admission, proceeded to use generative artificial intelligence to cheat on nearly every assignment. As a computer-science major, he depended on AI for his introductory programming classes: “I’d just dump the prompt into ChatGPT and hand in whatever it spat out.” By his rough math, AI wrote 80 percent of every essay he turned in. “At the end, I’d put on the finishing touches. I’d just insert 20 percent of my humanity, my voice, into it,” Lee told me recently.\\nLee was born in South Korea and grew up outside Atlanta, where his parents run a college-prep consulting business. He said he was admitted to Harvard early in his senior year of high school, but the university rescinded its offer after he was suspended for sneaking out during an overnight field trip before graduation. A year later, he applied to 26 schools; he didn’t get into any of them. So he spent the next year at a community college, before transferring to Columbia. (His personal essay, which turned his winding road to higher education into a parable for his ambition to build companies, was written with help from ChatGPT.) When he started at Columbia as a sophomore this past September, he didn’t worry much about academics or his GPA. “Most assignments in college are not relevant,” he told me. “They’re hackable by AI, and I just had no interest in doing them.” While other new students fretted over the university’s rigorous core curriculum, described by the school as “intellectually expansive” and “personally transformative,” Lee used AI to breeze through with minimal effort. When I asked him why he had gone through so much trouble to get to an Ivy League university only to off-load all of the learning to a robot, he said, “It’s the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife.”\\nBy the end of his first semester, Lee checked off one of those boxes. He met a co-founder, Neel Shanmugam, a junior in the school of engineering, and together they developed a series of potential start-ups: a dating app just for Columbia students, a sales tool for liquor distributors, and a note-taking app. None of them took off. Then Lee had an idea. As a coder, he had spent some 600 miserable hours on LeetCode, a training platform that prepares coders to answer the algorithmic riddles tech companies ask job and internship candidates during interviews. Lee, like many young developers, found the riddles tedious and mostly irrelevant to the work coders might actually do on the job. What was the point? What if they built a program that hid AI from browsers during remote job interviews so that interviewees could cheat their way through instead?\\nIn February, Lee and Shanmugam launched a tool that did just that. Interview Coder’s website featured a banner that read F*CK LEETCODE. Lee posted a video of himself on YouTube using it to cheat his way through an internship interview with Amazon. (He actually got the internship, but turned it down.) A month later, Lee was called into Columbia’s academic-integrity office. The school put him on disciplinary probation after a committee found him guilty of “advertising a link to a cheating tool” and “providing students with the knowledge to access this tool and use it how they see fit,” according to the committee’s report.\\nLee thought it absurd that Columbia, which had a partnership with ChatGPT’s parent company, OpenAI, would punish him for innovating with AI. Although Columbia’s policy on AI is similar to that of many other universities’ — students are prohibited from using it unless their professor explicitly permits them to do so, either on a class-by-class or case-by-case basis — Lee said he doesn’t know a single student at the school who isn’t using AI to cheat. To be clear, Lee doesn’t think this is a bad thing. “I think we are years — or months, probably — away from a world where nobody thinks using AI for homework is considered cheating,” he said.\\nIn January 2023, just two months after OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a survey of 1,000 college students found that nearly 90 percent of them had used the chatbot to help with homework assignments. In its first year of existence, ChatGPT’s total monthly visits steadily increased month-over-month until June, when schools let out for the summer. (That wasn’t an anomaly: Traffic dipped again over the summer in 2024.) Professors and teaching assistants increasingly found themselves staring at essays filled with clunky, robotic phrasing that, though grammatically flawless, didn’t sound quite like a college student — or even a human. Two and a half years later, students at large state schools, the Ivies, liberal-arts schools in New England, universities abroad, professional schools, and community colleges are relying on AI to ease their way through every facet of their education. Generative-AI chatbots — ChatGPT but also Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Microsoft’s Copilot, and others — take their notes during class, devise their study guides and practice tests, summarize novels and textbooks, and brainstorm, outline, and draft their essays. STEM students are using AI to automate their research and data analyses and to sail through dense coding and debugging assignments. “College is just how well I can use ChatGPT at this point,” a student in Utah recently captioned a video of herself copy-and-pasting a chapter from her Genocide and Mass Atrocity textbook into ChatGPT.\\nSarah, a freshman at Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario, said she first used ChatGPT to cheat during the spring semester of her final year of high school. (Sarah’s name, like those of other current students in this article, has been changed for privacy.) After getting acquainted with the chatbot, Sarah used it for all her classes: Indigenous studies, law, English, and a “hippie farming class” called Green Industries. “My grades were amazing,” she said. “It changed my life.” Sarah continued to use AI when she started college this past fall. Why wouldn’t she? Rarely did she sit in class and not see other students’ laptops open to ChatGPT. Toward the end of the semester, she began to think she might be dependent on the website. She already considered herself addicted to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit, where she writes under the username maybeimnotsmart. “I spend so much time on TikTok,” she said. “Hours and hours, until my eyes start hurting, which makes it hard to plan and do my schoolwork. With ChatGPT, I can write an essay in two hours that normally takes 12.”\\nTeachers have tried AI-proofing assignments, returning to Blue Books or switching to oral exams. Brian Patrick Green, a tech-ethics scholar at Santa Clara University, immediately stopped assigning essays after he tried ChatGPT for the first time. Less than three months later, teaching a course called Ethics and Artificial Intelligence, he figured a low-stakes reading reflection would be safe — surely no one would dare use ChatGPT to write something personal. But one of his students turned in a reflection with robotic language and awkward phrasing that Green knew was AI-generated. A philosophy professor across the country at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock caught students in her Ethics and Technology class using AI to respond to the prompt “Briefly introduce yourself and say what you’re hoping to get out of this class.”\\nIt isn’t as if cheating is new. But now, as one student put it, “the ceiling has been blown off.” Who could resist a tool that makes every assignment easier with seemingly no consequences? After spending the better part of the past two years grading AI-generated papers, Troy Jollimore, a poet, philosopher, and Cal State Chico ethics professor, has concerns. “Massive numbers of students are going to emerge from university with degrees, and into the workforce, who are essentially illiterate,” he said. “Both in the literal sense and in the sense of being historically illiterate and having no knowledge of their own culture, much less anyone else’s.” That future may arrive sooner than expected when you consider what a short window college really is. Already, roughly half of all undergrads have never experienced college without easy access to generative AI. “We’re talking about an entire generation of learning perhaps significantly undermined here,” said Green, the Santa Clara tech ethicist. “It’s short-circuiting the learning process, and it’s happening fast.”\\nBefore OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, cheating had already reached a sort of zenith. At the time, many college students had finished high school remotely, largely unsupervised, and with access to tools like Chegg and Course Hero. These companies advertised themselves as vast online libraries of textbooks and course materials but, in reality, were cheating multi-tools. For $15.95 a month, Chegg promised answers to homework questions in as little as 30 minutes, 24/7, from the 150,000 experts with advanced degrees it employed, mostly in India. When ChatGPT launched, students were primed for a tool that was faster, more capable.\\nBut school administrators were stymied. There would be no way to enforce an all-out ChatGPT ban, so most adopted an ad hoc approach, leaving it up to professors to decide whether to allow students to use AI. Some universities welcomed it, partnering with developers, rolling out their own chatbots to help students register for classes, or launching new classes, certificate programs, and majors focused on generative AI. But regulation remained difficult. How much AI help was acceptable? Should students be able to have a dialogue with AI to get ideas but not ask it to write the actual sentences?\\nThese days, professors will often state their policy on their syllabi — allowing AI, for example, as long as students cite it as if it were any other source, or permitting it for conceptual help only, or requiring students to provide receipts of their dialogue with a chatbot. Students often interpret those instructions as guidelines rather than hard rules. Sometimes they will cheat on their homework without even knowing — or knowing exactly how much — they are violating university policy when they ask a chatbot to clean up a draft or find a relevant study to cite. Wendy, a freshman finance major at one of the city’s top universities, told me that she is against using AI. Or, she clarified, “I’m against copy-and-pasting. I’m against cheating and plagiarism. All of that. It’s against the student handbook.” Then she described, step-by-step, how on a recent Friday at 8 a.m., she called up an AI platform to help her write a four-to-five-page essay due two hours later.\\nWhenever Wendy uses AI to write an essay (which is to say, whenever she writes an essay), she follows three steps. Step one: “I say, ‘I’m a first-year college student. I’m taking this English class.’” Otherwise, Wendy said, “it will give you a very advanced, very complicated writing style, and you don’t want that.” Step two: Wendy provides some background on the class she’s taking before copy-and-pasting her professor’s instructions into the chatbot. Step three: “Then I ask, ‘According to the prompt, can you please provide me an outline or an organization to give me a structure so that I can follow and write my essay?’ It then gives me an outline, introduction, topic sentences, paragraph one, paragraph two, paragraph three.” Sometimes, Wendy asks for a bullet list of ideas to support or refute a given argument: “I have difficulty with organization, and this makes it really easy for me to follow.”\\nOnce the chatbot had outlined Wendy’s essay, providing her with a list of topic sentences and bullet points of ideas, all she had to do was fill it in. Wendy delivered a tidy five-page paper at an acceptably tardy 10:17 a.m. When I asked her how she did on the assignment, she said she got a good grade. “I really like writing,” she said, sounding strangely nostalgic for her high-school English class — the last time she wrote an essay unassisted. “Honestly,” she continued, “I think there is beauty in trying to plan your essay. You learn a lot. You have to think, Oh, what can I write in this paragraph? Or What should my thesis be? ” But she’d rather get good grades. “An essay with ChatGPT, it’s like it just gives you straight up what you have to follow. You just don’t really have to think that much.”\\nI asked Wendy if I could read the paper she turned in, and when I opened the document, I was surprised to see the topic: critical pedagogy, the philosophy of education pioneered by Paulo Freire. The philosophy examines the influence of social and political forces on learning and classroom dynamics. Her opening line: “To what extent is schooling hindering students’ cognitive ability to think critically?” Later, I asked Wendy if she recognized the irony in using AI to write not just a paper on critical pedagogy but one that argues learning is what “makes us truly human.” She wasn’t sure what to make of the question. “I use AI a lot. Like, every day,” she said. “And I do believe it could take away that critical-thinking part. But it’s just — now that we rely on it, we can’t really imagine living without it.”\\nMost of the writing professors I spoke to told me that it’s abundantly clear when their students use AI. Sometimes there’s a smoothness to the language, a flattened syntax; other times, it’s clumsy and mechanical. The arguments are too evenhanded — counterpoints tend to be presented just as rigorously as the paper’s central thesis. Words like multifaceted and context pop up more than they might normally. On occasion, the evidence is more obvious, as when last year a teacher reported reading a paper that opened with “As an AI, I have been programmed …” Usually, though, the evidence is more subtle, which makes nailing an AI plagiarist harder than identifying the deed. Some professors have resorted to deploying so-called Trojan horses, sticking strange phrases, in small white text, in between the paragraphs of an essay prompt. (The idea is that this would theoretically prompt ChatGPT to insert a non sequitur into the essay.) Students at Santa Clara recently found the word broccoli hidden in a professor’s assignment. Last fall, a professor at the University of Oklahoma sneaked the phrases “mention Finland” and “mention Dua Lipa” in his. A student discovered his trap and warned her classmates about it on TikTok. “It does work sometimes,” said Jollimore, the Cal State Chico professor. “I’ve used ‘How would Aristotle answer this?’ when we hadn’t read Aristotle. But I’ve also used absurd ones and they didn’t notice that there was this crazy thing in their paper, meaning these are people who not only didn’t write the paper but also didn’t read their own paper before submitting it.”\\nStill, while professors may think they are good at detecting AI-generated writing, studies have found they’re actually not. One, published in June 2024, used fake student profiles to slip 100 percent AI-generated work into professors’ grading piles at a U.K. university. The professors failed to flag 97 percent. It doesn’t help that since ChatGPT’s launch, AI’s capacity to write human-sounding essays has only gotten better. Which is why universities have enlisted AI detectors like Turnitin, which uses AI to recognize patterns in AI-generated text. After evaluating a block of text, detectors provide a percentage score that indicates the alleged likelihood it was AI-generated. Students talk about professors who are rumored to have certain thresholds (25 percent, say) above which an essay might be flagged as an honor-code violation. But I couldn’t find a single professor — at large state schools or small private schools, elite or otherwise — who admitted to enforcing such a policy. Most seemed resigned to the belief that AI detectors don’t work. It’s true that different AI detectors have vastly different success rates, and there is a lot of conflicting data. While some claim to have less than a one percent false-positive rate, studies have shown they trigger more false positives for essays written by neurodivergent students and students who speak English as a second language. Turnitin’s chief product officer, Annie Chechitelli, told me that the product is tuned to err on the side of caution, more inclined to trigger a false negative than a false positive so that teachers don’t wrongly accuse students of plagiarism. I fed Wendy’s essay through a free AI detector, ZeroGPT, and it came back as 11.74 AI-generated, which seemed low given that AI, at the very least, had generated her central arguments. I then fed a chunk of text from the Book of Genesis into ZeroGPT and it came back as 93.33 percent AI-generated.\\nThere are, of course, plenty of simple ways to fool both professors and detectors. After using AI to produce an essay, students can always rewrite it in their own voice or add typos. Or they can ask AI to do that for them: One student on TikTok said her preferred prompt is “Write it as a college freshman who is a li’l dumb.” Students can also launder AI-generated paragraphs through other AIs, some of which advertise the “authenticity” of their outputs or allow students to upload their past essays to train the AI in their voice. “They’re really good at manipulating the systems. You put a prompt in ChatGPT, then put the output into another AI system, then put it into another AI system. At that point, if you put it into an AI-detection system, it decreases the percentage of AI used every time,” said Eric, a sophomore at Stanford.\\nMost professors have come to the conclusion that stopping rampant AI abuse would require more than simply policing individual cases and would likely mean overhauling the education system to consider students more holistically. “Cheating correlates with mental health, well-being, sleep exhaustion, anxiety, depression, belonging,” said Denise Pope, a senior lecturer at Stanford and one of the world’s leading student-engagement researchers.\\nMany teachers now seem to be in a state of despair. In the fall, Sam Williams was a teaching assistant for a writing-intensive class on music and social change at the University of Iowa that, officially, didn’t allow students to use AI at all. Williams enjoyed reading and grading the class’s first assignment: a personal essay that asked the students to write about their own music tastes. Then, on the second assignment, an essay on the New Orleans jazz era (1890 to 1920), many of his students’ writing styles changed drastically. Worse were the ridiculous factual errors. Multiple essays contained entire paragraphs on Elvis Presley (born in 1935). “I literally told my class, ‘Hey, don’t use AI. But if you’re going to cheat, you have to cheat in a way that’s intelligent. You can’t just copy exactly what it spits out,’” Williams said.\\nWilliams knew most of the students in this general-education class were not destined to be writers, but he thought the work of getting from a blank page to a few semi-coherent pages was, above all else, a lesson in effort. In that sense, most of his students utterly failed. “They’re using AI because it’s a simple solution and it’s an easy way for them not to put in time writing essays. And I get it, because I hated writing essays when I was in school,” Williams said. “But now, whenever they encounter a little bit of difficulty, instead of fighting their way through that and growing from it, they retreat to something that makes it a lot easier for them.”\\nBy November, Williams estimated that at least half of his students were using AI to write their papers. Attempts at accountability were pointless. Williams had no faith in AI detectors, and the professor teaching the class instructed him not to fail individual papers, even the clearly AI-smoothed ones. “Every time I brought it up with the professor, I got the sense he was underestimating the power of ChatGPT, and the departmental stance was, ‘Well, it’s a slippery slope, and we can’t really prove they’re using AI,’” Williams said. “I was told to grade based on what the essay would’ve gotten if it were a ‘true attempt at a paper.’ So I was grading people on their ability to use ChatGPT.”\\nThe “true attempt at a paper” policy ruined Williams’s grading scale. If he gave a solid paper that was obviously written with AI a B, what should he give a paper written by someone who actually wrote their own paper but submitted, in his words, “a barely literate essay”? The confusion was enough to sour Williams on education as a whole. By the end of the semester, he was so disillusioned that he decided to drop out of graduate school altogether. “We’re in a new generation, a new time, and I just don’t think that’s what I want to do,” he said.\\nJollimore, who has been teaching writing for more than two decades, is now convinced that the humanities, and writing in particular, are quickly becoming an anachronistic art elective like basket-weaving. “Every time I talk to a colleague about this, the same thing comes up: retirement. When can I retire? When can I get out of this? That’s what we’re all thinking now,” he said. “This is not what we signed up for.” Williams, and other educators I spoke to, described AI’s takeover as a full-blown existential crisis. “The students kind of recognize that the system is broken and that there’s not really a point in doing this. Maybe the original meaning of these assignments has been lost or is not being communicated to them well.”\\nHe worries about the long-term consequences of passively allowing 18-year-olds to decide whether to actively engage with their assignments. Would it accelerate the widening soft-skills gap in the workplace? If students rely on AI for their education, what skills would they even bring to the workplace? Lakshya Jain, a computer-science lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, has been using those questions in an attempt to reason with his students. “If you’re handing in AI work,” he tells them, “you’re not actually anything different than a human assistant to an artificial-intelligence engine, and that makes you very easily replaceable. Why would anyone keep you around?” That’s not theoretical: The COO of a tech research firm recently asked Jain why he needed programmers any longer.\\nThe ideal of college as a place of intellectual growth, where students engage with deep, profound ideas, was gone long before ChatGPT. The combination of high costs and a winner-takes-all economy had already made it feel transactional, a means to an end. (In a recent survey, Deloitte found that just over half of college graduates believe their education was worth the tens of thousands of dollars it costs a year, compared with 76 percent of trade-school graduates.) In a way, the speed and ease with which AI proved itself able to do college-level work simply exposed the rot at the core. “How can we expect them to grasp what education means when we, as educators, haven’t begun to undo the years of cognitive and spiritual damage inflicted by a society that treats schooling as a means to a high-paying job, maybe some social status, but nothing more?” Jollimore wrote in a recent essay. “Or, worse, to see it as bearing no value at all, as if it were a kind of confidence trick, an elaborate sham?”\\nIt’s not just the students: Multiple AI platforms now offer tools to leave AI-generated feedback on students’ essays. Which raises the possibility that AIs are now evaluating AI-generated papers, reducing the entire academic exercise to a conversation between two robots — or maybe even just one.\\nIt’ll be years before we can fully account for what all of this is doing to students’ brains. Some early research shows that when students off-load cognitive duties onto chatbots, their capacity for memory, problem-solving, and creativity could suffer. Multiple studies published within the past year have linked AI usage with a deterioration in critical-thinking skills; one found the effect to be more pronounced in younger participants. In February, Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University published a study that found a person’s confidence in generative AI correlates with reduced critical-thinking effort. The net effect seems, if not quite Wall-E, at least a dramatic reorganization of a person’s efforts and abilities, away from high-effort inquiry and fact-gathering and toward integration and verification. This is all especially unnerving if you add in the reality that AI is imperfect — it might rely on something that is factually inaccurate or just make something up entirely — with the ruinous effect social media has had on Gen Z’s ability to tell fact from fiction. The problem may be much larger than generative AI. The so-called Flynn effect refers to the consistent rise in IQ scores from generation to generation going back to at least the 1930s. That rise started to slow, and in some cases reverse, around 2006. “The greatest worry in these times of generative AI is not that it may compromise human creativity or intelligence,” Robert Sternberg, a psychology professor at Cornell University, told The Guardian, “but that it already has.”\\nStudents are worrying about this, even if they’re not willing or able to give up the chatbots that are making their lives exponentially easier. Daniel, a computer-science major at the University of Florida, told me he remembers the first time he tried ChatGPT vividly. He marched down the hall to his high-school computer-science teacher’s classroom, he said, and whipped out his Chromebook to show him. “I was like, ‘Dude, you have to see this!’ My dad can look back on Steve Jobs’s iPhone keynote and think, Yeah, that was a big moment. That’s what it was like for me, looking at something that I would go on to use every day for the rest of my life.”\\nAI has made Daniel more curious; he likes that whenever he has a question, he can quickly access a thorough answer. But when he uses AI for homework, he often wonders, If I took the time to learn that, instead of just finding it out, would I have learned a lot more? At school, he asks ChatGPT to make sure his essays are polished and grammatically correct, to write the first few paragraphs of his essays when he’s short on time, to handle the grunt work in his coding classes, to cut basically all cuttable corners. Sometimes, he knows his use of AI is a clear violation of student conduct, but most of the time it feels like he’s in a gray area. “I don’t think anyone calls seeing a tutor cheating, right? But what happens when a tutor starts writing lines of your paper for you?” he said.\\nRecently, Mark, a freshman math major at the University of Chicago, admitted to a friend that he had used ChatGPT more than usual to help him code one of his assignments. His friend offered a somewhat comforting metaphor: “You can be a contractor building a house and use all these power tools, but at the end of the day, the house won’t be there without you.” Still, Mark said, “it’s just really hard to judge. Is this my work? ” I asked Daniel a hypothetical to try to understand where he thought his work began and AI’s ended: Would he be upset if he caught a romantic partner sending him an AI-generated poem? “I guess the question is what is the value proposition of the thing you’re given? Is it that they created it? Or is the value of the thing itself?” he said. “In the past, giving someone a letter usually did both things.” These days, he sends handwritten notes — after he has drafted them using ChatGPT.\\n“Language is the mother, not the handmaiden, of thought,” wrote Duke professor Orin Starn in a recent column titled “My Losing Battle Against AI Cheating,” citing a quote often attributed to W. H. Auden. But it’s not just writing that develops critical thinking. “Learning math is working on your ability to systematically go through a process to solve a problem. Even if you’re not going to use algebra or trigonometry or calculus in your career, you’re going to use those skills to keep track of what’s up and what’s down when things don’t make sense,” said Michael Johnson, an associate provost at Texas A&M University. Adolescents benefit from structured adversity, whether it’s algebra or chores. They build self-esteem and work ethic. It’s why the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has argued for the importance of children learning to do hard things, something that technology is making infinitely easier to avoid. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has tended to brush off concerns about AI use in academia as shortsighted, describing ChatGPT as merely “a calculator for words” and saying the definition of cheating needs to evolve. “Writing a paper the old-fashioned way is not going to be the thing,” Altman, a Stanford dropout, said last year. But speaking before the Senate’s oversight committee on technology in 2023, he confessed his own reservations: “I worry that as the models get better and better, the users can have sort of less and less of their own discriminating process.” OpenAI hasn’t been shy about marketing to college students. It recently made ChatGPT Plus, normally a $20-per-month subscription, free to them during finals. (OpenAI contends that students and teachers need to be taught how to use it responsibly, pointing to the ChatGPT Edu product it sells to academic institutions.)\\nIn late March, Columbia suspended Lee after he posted details about his disciplinary hearing on X. He has no plans to go back to school and has no desire to work for a big-tech company, either. Lee explained to me that by showing the world AI could be used to cheat during a remote job interview, he had pushed the tech industry to evolve the same way AI was forcing higher education to evolve. “Every technological innovation has caused humanity to sit back and think about what work is actually useful,” he said. “There might have been people complaining about machinery replacing blacksmiths in, like, the 1600s or 1800s, but now it’s just accepted that it’s useless to learn how to blacksmith.”\\nLee has already moved on from hacking interviews. In April, he and Shanmugam launched Cluely, which scans a user’s computer screen and listens to its audio in order to provide AI feedback and answers to questions in real time without prompting. “We built Cluely so you never have to think alone again,” the company’s manifesto reads. This time, Lee attempted a viral launch with a $140,000 scripted advertisement in which a young software engineer, played by Lee, uses Cluely installed on his glasses to lie his way through a first date with an older woman. When the date starts going south, Cluely suggests Lee “reference her art” and provides a script for him to follow. “I saw your profile and the painting with the tulips. You are the most gorgeous girl ever,” Lee reads off his glasses, which rescues his chances with her.\\nBefore launching Cluely, Lee and Shanmugam raised $5.3 million from investors, which allowed them to hire two coders, friends Lee met in community college (no job interviews or LeetCode riddles were necessary), and move to San Francisco. When we spoke a few days after Cluely’s launch, Lee was at his Realtor’s office and about to get the keys to his new workspace. He was running Cluely on his computer as we spoke. While Cluely can’t yet deliver real-time answers through people’s glasses, the idea is that someday soon it’ll run on a wearable device, seeing, hearing, and reacting to everything in your environment. “Then, eventually, it’s just in your brain,” Lee said matter-of-factly. For now, Lee hopes people will use Cluely to continue AI’s siege on education. “We’re going to target the digital LSATs; digital GREs; all campus assignments, quizzes, and tests,” he said. “It will enable you to cheat on pretty much everything.”'}\n",

Yet on the other hand, these sprawling digital infrastructures are much harder to secure.\\nAs a result, the impact of cybercrime is expected to cost organizations a massive $10.5 trillion in 2025. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that breaches go undetected for an average of 212 days and take another 75 days to contain.\\nCompanies are keen to adopt cloud technologies to aid the growth and agility of their business. However, this means that securing the perimeter is no longer just a case of monitoring on-premise systems and networks.\\nHowever, the cause could also offer us the cure.\\nManaged file transfer (MFT) systems help to move data safely and securely internally and externally and protect messages and communications between the organization and its partners, suppliers and customers. They bring reliable, automated governance to the movement of files inside and outside the business and can accelerate big data movements around the globe.\\nWhat’s more, when combined strategically with cloud native platforms, MFTs are the secret to keeping data in flow and supporting real-time intelligent insights.\\nIn this episode, we pick the mind of Oded Nahum, Global Head of Cloud Practice at Ness Digital Engineering (Ness), to get a deeper understanding of just why MFTs are so important to modern cloud infrastructures.\\nNahum leads a talented team of cloud architects, consultants, and engineers to deliver cutting-edge cloud solutions across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and hybrid environments at Ness.\\nWith deep experience in cloud-native architectures, IT automation, cloud security, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC), Nahum works to leverage the power of the cloud to unlock new business capabilities and integrate AI-driven solutions that enhance operational intelligence.\\nIn this episode, Nahum will take a deep dive into the benefits of MFTs when used in a cloud native platform in order to keep data flowing across the organization without compromising on security.\\n“Cloud-native MFT is not just an endpoint solution but a strategic capability. And its full value is unlocked when treated as part of a broader data exchange strategy.”\\nYou can listen to the full episode below, or onSpotify, Anchor, Apple Podcasts, Breaker,, Google Podcasts, Stitcher, Overcast, Listen Notes, PodBean, and Radio Public.\\n/\\nTranscript:\\nOded Nahum: Hi everyone, my name is Oded Nahum. I work for Nest Digital Engineering. Currently my role is the global head of the cloud and streaming, data streaming practice. My team is a consulting arm that works alongside our engineering friends at Nest. We tend to work with many clients that try to solve complicated and challenging problems when it comes to cloud, anything from adoption to strategy to optimization, to figuring out which technologies to use. So we get to touch the very core of systems of the clients that we work with.\\nA lot of time we, you know, push their imagination and boundaries a little bit more about how to maximize the value of what cloud computing can do. And this is really kind of the way that I approach cloud — it’s a value enabler on its own. It’s just a platform. It’s what you do with it and how you understand the business problems that you’re trying to solve for your clients that defines the way that we operate, what we’re building for our clients.\\n**Erick Espinosa:**Perfect. I’m excited to dive deeper into this. Oded, thank you. First, I want to thank you for taking the time to join me today for this episode. I’m sure your insight will be very valuable for the variety of listeners out there that are listening right now, especially those that are looking to build their company’s AI infrastructure.\\nWe’re seeing organizations increasingly double down on AI and data driven strategies, and the numbers show this specifically. And I’m going to quote here KPMG report: over the next year, 68% of companies are planning to invest between 50 million and 250 million. So this is companies of all sizes. This is having a big impact on platforms like AWS and Azure and how they are evolving specifically. Can you talk to us a little bit more about that?\\n**Oded Nahum:**Yeah. So AI, I’ve kind of looked at it as like when this hype kind of picked up, I was like, wait, why are you guys getting excited? We’ve been doing it for about 10 years, right? But actually what triggered this thing is not AI, it’s Gen AI, right? AI and artificial intelligence, machine learning, have existed for quite some time. And we’ve been in that space — pretty much every kind of data engineering and analytics workload uses some of these things.\\nWhat made this thing so interesting is the Gen or the generative AI, which basically allows these models to start creating things that did not exist before. And that opened up this big Pandora’s box that we’re trying to figure out now what to do. There’s a huge amount of excitement, right? And everybody’s trying to figure out: how do I use it? What’s the value? Where do I put it to work?\\nMany companies that we work with are trying various different things. And I think we’re all in a certain way looking at, okay, what is the actual business value that I can bring? Where do I go from a pilot to actually get this thing to work? I think we’re in the last six months seeing positive signs of the technology and the use cases. It’s going from just a crazy hype to — there’s real value that we can create. It comes with a whole set of challenges, right? Don’t get me wrong. This is still kind of an unknown territory for many of us. All the things it can do and the challenges that it brings — not just from a knowledge perspective, but from adoption — you’re kind of giving half your brain to a machine that you hope will get it right. And it doesn’t always do that. So we’re still in the middle of that hype and journey, but it’s becoming a little bit more clear and definitely more interesting.\\nErick Espinosa: Why would you say most enterprises are using, I guess, more cloud native AI infrastructure? What would be the benefits of this specifically?\\n**Oded Nahum:**One of the things about AI is that it takes an enormous amount of compute power. These are specialized silicons — NVIDIA’s of the world. I mean, companies don’t normally go and invest millions of dollars setting up the infrastructure that they need to run these models. And in the cloud, it’s just very accessible. For you to bring up a workload and say, go run these things on cloud infrastructure, it becomes super easy.\\nI mean, that has been one of the values of cloud before Gen AI, right? The fact that you can get access to all of the latest and greatest technology with literally a click of a button without commitment of buying anything. So this becomes a consumption-based model that’s very attractive.\\nHow do you experiment? How do you iterate? How do you test different things? You know, that’s what makes cloud the perfect place to start running AI or Gen AI workloads. For many companies, a lot of the data is on the cloud as well. And if you start building Gen AI applications — I’m not talking ChatGPT, but RAGs (retrieval augmented generation) that look at your own data — that data is in the cloud. So obviously you want to run it where your data is.\\nSo that’s — it’s kind of a perfect fit. Even though today we are seeing specialized cloud environments focusing on just giving you the raw power of GPU processing, they come at a better price point. They don’t have all of the manageability that AWS and Azure give us and all of the tools and UIs — you still have to do the lifting. But if you’re just looking at the price per GPU cycle, you can find interesting pricing alternatives.\\nErick Espinosa: I always used to associate GPUs with gaming. And now I’m hearing it a lot more in terms of building infrastructures for companies, because there is, I guess, when you’re thinking about a company, especially one that’s just starting to invest, you want to make sure that you have enough money to invest in this infrastructure, right? But it sounds like at least the cloud native platforms allow people to kind of enter this realm a little bit — like, you know, with their finances in mind. Do you know what I’m saying?\\nOded Nahum: Well, definitely. I wish more of them would do that, right? Understanding the cloud economics is still, I think, an industry-wide challenge. The fact that someone’s giving you access to an incredible technology — just go and use it — and it’s only like three cents per second, before you start looking at it and you get the bill at the end of the month and go, “Oh my God, what did I just do?” That is still a problem.\\nBut if you get it right, yes, the economics is very attractive. But it is still something that we as an industry are trying to figure out — the cost modeling of cloud, right? Is it better to run it on-prem? And, you know, the last few years, we had this movement called cloud exits, where people were like, “Oh, cloud is too expensive. I’m going back to my data center.” I don’t think it’s a big phenomenon, but it does happen. And there are scenarios where you say, “You know what, for my workload, my data center is better.”\\nErick Espinosa: And a big focus recently has been MFTs, which are managed file transfers. I just learned about this. But for those that are unfamiliar, can you explain a little bit more about what that is?\\n**Oded Nahum:**MFT is making a comeback because it’s actually not a new technology.\\nWe’ve been moving files for many, many years. There are a bunch of traditional solutions that companies used to run in their data centers — big monolithic Windows-based solutions. And the problem became with these solutions is that, one, security. You mentioned security. So to keep up the security patches on these machines is sometimes challenging. There were some breaches that companies got scared of. But the biggest problem was manageability. How do you manage a system that needs to process 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 files per day?\\nThink of any large regulated industry that needs to work with their business partners — which are not internal business units of a company — a bank, credit companies, payment processing, insurance companies, car manufacturers. All of them have hundreds, if not thousands of business partners that continuously send files to them, whether it’s a car configuration or a loan application.\\nSo essentially, you’re opening up the front door of your most secure environment and saying, “Send me 100,000 files.” That is a huge security problem that needs to be understood because security sometimes is a question of statistics, right? If I got three people in my house, I know who they are, I can vouch for them. If I got 10,000 people coming into my house, statistically, one of them might be a bad actor. So MFT started moving to the cloud because it had the scale to process a lot of that data and it had the right set of controls to create that end-to-end security structure.\\nAnywhere from the protocol — we use SFTP, and SFTP has been around for a long time — and I don’t know if you ever heard of the Lindy effect. It’s an interesting way of looking at it. The Lindy effect basically says the amount of time that something has survived can predict how long it will be in the future.\\n**Erick Espinosa:**That’s very interesting.\\nOded Nahum: Think of Shakespeare — it’s been around for a while. Maybe it’s going to be here 100 years from now, right? That’s kind of the way, and it’s like an interesting statistical model. SFTP is a protocol, kind of survived the test of time. It’s been here for 30 years. It’s industry-accepted, and that allows us to create this communication channel between anyone in my own data center. Now, once data gets into the cloud, we can apply multiple layers of control over it, anywhere from virus scanning to PII scanning to whatever. I guess AI comes into play here because we can do some anomaly detection and start to understand patterns that might suggest that this is not what we expected to get.\\nHow do you do it at massive scale and fully automated? Because nobody’s sitting and clicking 100,000 times to move a file from one place to the other. So that suddenly got the excitement back to how do we use these things. With companies that still rely on files, right? Whether it’s a PDF or Excel or CSV, it created a very interesting kind of structure. We’re seeing already the evolution of MFT because if you look at just data movements across organizations, there’s various other ways. There’s API, there’s event-driven architectures, and MFT fits very well into the bigger picture of data exchange platforms.\\nErick Espinosa: So are you suggesting this is going to become like, I guess, the primary solution in terms of or the direction that most organizations are going for when it comes to transferring these types of files?\\nOded Nahum: If the data you’re moving is a file, it is definitely the workhorse that does all of that work, the heavy lifting. More modern architectures involve streaming data. So I’ll give you an example, right? Think of an exchange, right? Capital market exchange, people trade stuff. This thing produces an enormous amount of data that’s continuously being streamed over to a system that analyzes and looks at the data. That is a streaming type of architecture. Most, not most, but definitely some of the older systems do not support the ability to stream. So what they do is they package that data in big files and then they move it. What we call the end-of-day batch processing. That’s where MFT comes in.\\nIf the system is more modern, that it has the ability to stream data live, then we use streaming technologies like Kafka and things like this. But these two work very well together, right? And in many situations, we see both of them coexist. If the system that’s producing the data is old and it only understands files, let’s MFT it. If it can stream, let’s stream it. And both of them can be processed, both of them can be understood and analyzed and stored and put into a data warehouse and analytics and AI and all of the fun stuff we do with data.\\nErick Espinosa: The industry for me that comes to mind would be the financial industry. Are they, because I know you guys obviously specialize in MFTs, are they like the primary, would you say the primary industry that’s kind of focusing on this one as a secure way to transfer data?\\nOded Nahum: Yeah. Think payment processing, right? How many credit card transactions run in the US in a day? I don’t know, trillions. All of these things are aggregated through different exchanges and become files that contain these transactions. And then they need to go to a processing or whatever. So this is where you see some of these use cases. Insurance is another one that we see a lot. We get close to financial services. Loan processing. Everyone that still relies on somebody sending a file, right? Now multiply that by the scale of that industry.\\nAnother industry we’re seeing a lot is healthcare. They’re still kind of old school, sending files around, right? Between different hospitals or clinics. And the files can be an x-ray, but it can also be an application that somebody filled.\\nErick Espinosa: That came to mind for me because years ago, one of my first jobs was working at a bank. And the first thing I had to do was they had large filing cabinets. So all the files of these customers, I literally had to spend the whole day just filing these away. So in my mind, when I think of anything to do with filing, it’s banking, right?\\nOded Nahum: It’s definitely the biggest industry that we’re seeing picking these things up. And for them, it’s a replacement of the old products because they had them before. They’ve been using it, but they’re old. They’re monolithic. They’re hard to manage. They break. They need to be patched. There’s security issues with them. And they’re not close to where the data is or where the data is being processed.\\nAnd that’s really where MFT in the cloud makes it really interesting because once the file comes in, there’s endless things that we can do to process that file. I can pick it up in AWS, process it and send it to Google, for example. Google BigQuery is one of the fastest and most sophisticated analytics engines. So companies want to use Google BigQuery, but MFT runs on AWS in a much better way. So these patterns work very, very well. So that’s kind of a multi-cloud play. But there’s so many things we can do with the data as it comes in that you couldn’t do when it was on-prem. I mean, that’s what gets people excited. And the imagination here is the limit for what you can do with workflows and data processing.\\nA lot of it, again, we mentioned security. It is a big thing. We’re connecting pretty much every MFT we build to a security system that continuously monitors the behavior of it, understanding patterns and anomalies, and trying to detect scenarios. Because if you’re getting 10,000 files a day from multiple sources that, yes, you know they’re your clients, but they’re not companies that you are in charge of their security. If they get breached and somehow that file ended up with you, now it’s your problem. So that’s where security comes in and needs to be very, very tight and strict.\\nEverything that comes in has to be monitored, scanned, understood, and analyzed before it goes downstream for processing. Because hackers are really good at moving across systems.\\nErick Espinosa: And using the same tools, right? As much as we’re using AI for our benefit, they’re using it as a tool for them to hack.\\nOded Nahum: Yeah, we’ve seen some demos and scenarios of how an infected object or file gets into an S3 bucket, like a storage thing, and starts moving laterally. So it identifies the system that it can infect itself. And then ultimately, the goal for them is to get access to some sort of credentials that they can leverage.\\nAnd it’s surprisingly easy for people with knowledge. I think what we’ve seen with clients is that they don’t understand how to build the security for these solutions. The attack surface of the cloud is massive. It’s not like a big data center with big walls, firewalls, and nothing coming in and out. Cloud, by design, needs to be accessible and exposed—not exposed, but accessible—over the network. So the attack surface is much, much larger.\\nErick Espinosa: Out of curiosity, is it ever part of the discussion with the clients that you’re serving, in terms of if they decide, let’s say, to collaborate with another company, and they’re transferring files, do you ever advise them to do a lot more research in terms of what type of security systems the company they’re collaborating with has in place, just to make sure that everything’s protected?\\nOded Nahum: Absolutely. And for many companies, it becomes a policy. If you want to work with me, here’s the checklist. Prove to me that you follow these processes. And there’s a whole bunch of regulations and standards that validate that you are following these best practices for security. And there are even standards that can be implemented at the technology level itself. So it’s kind of a handshake between systems that says, “I want to send you data.” It’s like, “Okay, here’s the format.” And it’s “Okay, I can approve you sending.”\\nWe can even implement some of that in the technology itself. But yeah, these standards exist. And we’re trying to promote more and more companies to agree on these standards, because ultimately, we want these collaborations. I mean, that’s the lifeline of many companies: to be able to send data. So we have to make it accessible, workable, but not crazy complex that nobody knows how to implement this.\\nErick Espinosa: Does this also speak to companies that integrate with platforms? Let’s say somebody’s using AWS, and it’s like a fleet management company, and they’re integrating another tool with another company into their platform. Does this also apply with them in terms of the platform, not just transferring data?\\nOded Nahum: Usually, I mean, it’s not streamlined, put it this way. And the cloud providers don’t always like to collaborate with one another. I mean, there’s ways to do that. But it’s not an industry standard. Multicloud, right, which now everybody’s doing multicloud, is still, if you ask me, the biggest blocker of multicloud is the cloud providers themselves. Because they want to be the only one, the only game in town, right? So there’s no real standard between how to exchange information between the clouds. But there are standards and technology that we can leverage to do that. But it’s still a bit kind of a wild west.\\nErick Espinosa: In terms of the company that you work for, right, NAS, digital engineering, the solution that you provide specifically for MFT, what makes your company stand out in comparison to other companies entering this market?\\nOded Nahum: Yeah. So I think what’s interesting about NAS as a company, and MFT maybe more specifically, is that NAS started as an engineering firm, software development. We still are an engineering firm. A few years ago, we started investing in building capabilities around cloud, in addition to some more interesting data technologies. But ultimately, most of NAS is people who write software. So we’re coming in from this approach.\\nSome other cloud consulting firms come from the IT space. This is data centers, operating system servers. MFT for many years was part of the IT side. It wasn’t part of software development. And we kind of flipped that around. It’s like, yes, we understand the architecture and the infrastructure very well. But the real kicker is what we build, which I think is two things.\\nOne, the workflow engine. We’ve customized the workflow engine that allows us to implement any kind of business logic that the customer can think of about what happens when a file comes in. File comes in to an entry point, it triggers an event, that event gets picked up, and now I need to figure out what to do with this file. You can do a lot of different things that you couldn’t do before—take the file, scan it, wait for three other files to arrive, but don’t do it if it’s two in the afternoon because I want to wait until midnight—all these crazy rules that control the behavior until that process ends and the file or files end up in their destination.\\nThe second thing is that we built a user interface that simplifies adoption. A lot of companies approaching this may be new to the cloud. They’re used to Windows systems, click-click. Now this is all infrastructure as code, and it’s a bit of a blocker. So we built a UI that allows you to get up to speed pretty fast.\\nThe last thing we’re building, which I think is very cool, is that the workflow engine is complicated for many people because the people who define the workflows are business people, not techies. We have our own language that we use to create these workflows. We realized that if a business guy can explain to me in plain language what they want to do, that’s a perfect use case for GenAI. Essentially, we created an interface for them to describe in human language the workflow they want to run, and the machine translates it into how it gets implemented.\\nSo they would say: a file would come in, if the file name equals blah blah dot text, then take the file, change its name, compress it, run a virus scan on it, and move it to a database in a different dataset. Now they can explain it in language—they don’t need to explain it in code. That’s where GenAI does a really good job.\\nThe other thing is integration. These systems never live on their own. Nobody’s moving files for fun. You move it to integrate it with data warehouses, analytics, processing. And we’re quite good at doing those integrations with other systems.\\nErick Espinosa: Integration feels like another word for collaboration. A lot of what I think software developers, engineers are known for is collaboration, working together on projects. So a lot of what you said speaks to collaboration. And you guys are in the field of that, right? In terms of transferring files safely, because you guys have years of experience doing that specifically.\\nOded Nahum: Yeah. And understanding also the systems or the software that needs to actually understand that file and do something with it is where that integration comes in. Because if your only view is just doing the plumbing of moving files, it’s only half the picture. Taking the file, now putting them into an application or a database or an analytic system, that’s the other half where we’re building these things.\\nErick Espinosa: Before I let you go, what are some final pieces of advice you recommend IT decision makers keep in mind for 2025?\\nOded Nahum: Whoa, that’s a loaded question. I think the first thing that comes to mind, specifically for cloud, always look at cloud as the value enabler of your business. Try to find out what that value is, try to quantify it, and then see how you’re going to use it. Don’t go crazy all into the cloud without thinking about how that thing is going to look like and be operated. And then I’m sure you’ll be successful in doing that. Start with value, technology after.\\nErick Espinosa: Very good advice. Oded, thanks again for joining me. If somebody’s looking to connect with you, what’s the best way to get in touch?\\nOded Nahum: LinkedIn. There’s not too many people with my name—you can Google me or find me on LinkedIn. Oded Nahum.\\nErick Espinosa: All right. I appreciate your time.\\nOded Nahum: Thank you very much. Talk soon.\\nErick Espinosa, Journalist, The Sociable'}\n",

With this launch, the company is taking on other creative solutions such as Canva and Adobe, along with AI-powered website and prototype creators such as WordPress, Wix, Hostinger, and Replit.\\nThe company’s website-creation tool is called Figma Sites. The startup said that often designers build prototypes of what a site should look like within Figma. With the new AI-powered tool, they can easily create websites and even publish them. Once the site is generated, collaborators can easily change elements of the site through an editor without prompting.\\nUsers can also add transitions, animations, and scroll effects while making the site responsive. Figma is adding the ability to directly generate blog posts from its site. That means the Sites will have a content management system (CMS), which is an upcoming feature, baked in that lets users edit posts within the design of a blog and also manage other assets such as thumbnails and slugs.\\nFor interactive elements like stock tickers, you can add custom code or use AI to generate code for you.\\nFigma Make, on the other hand, is a similar AI-powered tool, which is geared more toward ideation and prototyping. Users can input a prompt to create a web application. The prototype app is collaborative, and users can prompt the assistant to change or add certain elements. Plus, if there is a developer on the team, they can directly modify the code to make necessary changes.\\nUsers can also generate small interactive elements, such as a clock, and embed them in the pages published through Figma Sites later.\\nYuhki Yamashita, chief product officer at Figma, said that both products share a lot of features and underlying technology.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend. Available through May 9 or while tables last.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend. Available through May 9 or while tables last.\\n“We want to enable high-fidelity prototyping with Figma, especially with Figma Make. You can add more data to it and try to see how viable an idea is in terms of final implementation. Whereas Figma Site is useful for a marketing and design team when they exactly know how a site should look and take full control of that,” Yamashita told TechCrunch while describing the differentiation between these products.\\nMultiple companies in different sectors are looking for a way to create interactive experiences using AI. Website hosting providers such as Squarespace, Wix, WordPress, and Hostinger have released tools to let users easily create websites through AI. On the other hand, tools like Replit and Lovable are pushing users to create apps or prototypes without coding knowledge. Last month, even Canva released a way to create interactive experiences within its designs with Canva Code.\\nThis isn’t Figma’s first foray into prototyping, though. Last year, it released a Make Design feature, which had to be pulled after users accused the company of heavily training the tool on existing apps.\\nWhat’s more, Figma is releasing a new tool for marketers called Figma Buzz. With these tools, marketers can easily use templates created by designers with brand-specific designs to make new creatives. They can also use a tool to insert AI-generated images or change the background of certain assets. Marketers can also create assets in bulk using data from sources like spreadsheets.\\nThe startup is also launching a tool called Figma Draw for vector editing and illustrations. Yamashita said that designers often had to export their vector designs outside Figma to make edits. The company is now adding features like text on a path, pattern fill, brushes, multi-vector edit, adding noise and texture, and a lasso selection to its Draw product.\\nFigma launched its Slides tool for creating presentations last year. With the new asset creation and drawing tool, the company is directly competing with creative suites such as Adobe and Canva. Yamashita denied that the company is directly competing with these creative tools. He said that Figma is in the business of building digital products, and a third of the company’s users are developers, thanks to tools like Dev Mode.\\nThe company is announcing a new plan called a content seat starting at $8 per month, which will give users access to Figma Buzz, Slides, FigJam, and Sites CMS.'}\n",

Legal teams shouldn’t be toggling between tools—they should be engaging with a single AI solution that works across their entire workflow.”\\nCentralized Legal AI That Works With You, Not Around You\\nUnlike point-solution tools that offer fragmented functionality, Practice AI delivers a unified, AI-powered dashboard that integrates directly with major case management platforms. Legal teams can use Practice AI to summarize legal and medical documents and generate personal injury and lemon law demand letters — all under one digital roof.\\nThe two flagship products powering this transformation:\\n- AI Case Summary: Extracts and organizes essential information from lengthy legal and medical documents, generating usable formats such as medical chronologies, issue-focused summaries, and timeline analyses.\\n- AI Demands: Produces high-quality, custom demand letters for:\\n- Motor Vehicle Accidents (Global Policy, Regular Time Limit, Third-Party)\\n- Dog Bite Cases\\n- Premise Liability (Slip & Fall)\\n- Lemon Law Claims\\nThese solutions allow law firms to complete in minutes what used to take hours or days—without sacrificing oversight or quality.\\nCPLG Welcomes AI into Their Legal Workflow\\nArizona-based Consumer Protection Law Group (CPLG), a lemon law-focused firm, recently adopted Practice AI and has already seen measurable benefits in case efficiency.\\n“We’re looking forward to welcoming the role AI is beginning to play in our field,” said the CPLG team. “Practice AI is helping us evaluate the efficiency of our virtual staff members with Virtual Staffing LLC. Not only will this help us save on overhead and staffing costs, but it has also proven that AI can be part of the law firm and help with efficiency. We welcome this innovation and appreciate the clarity and speed it brings to our case preparation process.”\\nWith lemon law demands requiring tight compliance and fast response times, CPLG has used Practice AI to improve documentation accuracy and accelerate case review.\\nAI With Ethics—and Attorneys—in Control\\nUnlike many emerging legal tech solutions that seek to automate attorney functions entirely, Practice AI is designed to support and enhance the legal process, never to replace it.\\n“AI should never replace the judgment of an attorney—it should reinforce it,” said Kohan. “That’s why our tools are designed for controlled AI interaction, where attorneys always retain the final say. AI can do the heavy lifting, but lawyers should always be in the driver’s seat.”\\nPractice AI embeds human checkpoints into every stage of the workflow.

Build smarter, grounded apps that actually know your business. \\nYour AI Needs a Memory Upgrade\\nWhat if your AI didn’t just sound smart, but could actually remember what matters?\\nNot just recite internet trivia, but answer questions about your latest product launch, your company’s policies, or Q4 financials—instantly, and with receipts.\\nThat’s the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the architecture quietly powering the most impressive AI apps of 2025.\\nThe Big Leap: From Smart to Knowing\\nLLMs like Claude, GPT-4, Gemini and LLaMa, are like brilliant interns: they know a lot, but only what they learned up to a certain point. They forget everything after the conversation ends, and they have zero clue about your unique business, docs, or data. Ask them about last week’s release or your internal process, and you’ll get a blank stare-or worse, hallucinations.\\nRAG is the memory upgrade.\\nIt gives your AI a persistent, searchable memory: an external brain that stores all your knowledge, documents, and data, and can instantly recall the most relevant facts when needed.\\n“RAG is how you build AI that doesn’t just talk - it knows.”\\nThe RAG Brain: How It Works (And Why It Feels Like Magic)\\nJust look at the RAG Enhanced Chatbot diagram above. Here’s how your AI gets a brain:\\n-\\nKnowledge Ingestion: Feed in your company docs, PDFs, support tickets, or any data source.\\n-\\nEmbeddings Model: Each chunk of data is transformed into a high-dimensional vector-a kind of digital fingerprint of its meaning.\\n-\\nVector Store (the “Memory”): All these vectors are stored in a specialized database optimized for fast, semantic search.\\n-\\nUser Query: When a user asks a question, it’s also converted into a vector.\\n-\\nRetrieval: The system finds the most similar vectors (i.e., the most relevant pieces of your knowledge).\\n-\\nLLM Synthesis: The LLM combines the retrieved information with its own reasoning to generate a grounded, accurate answer.\\n-\\nResponse: The user gets an answer that’s both smart and contextually relevant.\\n“Vector databases are to AI what the hippocampus is to your brain: the place where memories are stored, organized, and recalled on demand. ”\\nThe Stack: How RAG Makes AI Apps Unstoppable\\nThe modern RAG stack isn’t just about plugging in an LLM. It’s about orchestrating the right components:\\n|\\nComponent |\\nPurpose/Role |\\nPopular Tools/Examples |\\nNotes/Strengths |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|\\nVector Database |\\nStores and retrieves semantic embeddings |\\nPinecone, FAISS, Qdrant, Milvus, Chroma, Weaviate, pgvector |\\nFast, scalable, optimized for semantic search |\\n|\\nOrchestration Framework |\\nManages retrieval, prompts, and workflow |\\nLangChain, LlamaIndex |\\nConnects components, handles query flow |\\n|\\nLLM (Language Model) |\\nGenerates and synthesizes responses |\\nOpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), LLaMA |\\nProvides reasoning and natural language understanding |\\n|\\nAPI Layer |\\nExposes RAG logic as a service |\\nFastAPI, Flask, Express |\\nEnables integration with apps/web services |\\n|\\nMLOps/Monitoring |\\nEnsures reliability, scaling, and versioning |\\nMLflow, Weights & Biases, custom tools |\\nObservability, deployment, and continuous improvement |\\n“The best AI apps don’t just use LLMs-they connect them to the right data, at the right time, with the right memory.”\\nWhy Vector Databases Are the AI Memory Engine\\nTraditional databases are great for structured data and exact matches. But they’re lost when it comes to meaning: “What’s the policy for remote work?” might be phrased ten different ways in your docs.\\nVector databases store “meaning,” not just words. They transform text, images, and other data into high-dimensional vectors that capture the essence of content, making them ideal for:\\n- Semantic Search: Finds relevant info even if keywords don’t match.\\n- Personalization: Remembers user history and preferences.\\n- Real-Time Updates: Instantly incorporates new knowledge without retraining.\\n- Grounded, Trustworthy Answers: Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in real data.\\nThe Showdown: Pinecone, FAISS, and Postgres\\nChoosing the right vector database is the key to building a memorable AI app. Here’s the quick lowdown on three of the most influential players right now:\\n|\\nDatabase |\\nBest For |\\nWhat Makes It Shine |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|\\nPinecone |\\nManaged, scalable production |\\nEffortless scaling, blazing fast retrieval, real-time updates, and zero infrastructure setup-perfect for teams focused on product, not plumbing. Used by Notion, HubSpot, Shopify. |\\n|\\nFAISS |\\nDIY, high-performance labs |\\nOpen-source, highly customizable. Built by Meta. Great for custom workflows and when you want full control. Powers many research and internal tools. |\\n|\\nPostgres + pgvector |\\nIntegrating with existing SQL data |\\nSeamlessly adds vector search to your SQL stack. Great for structured data and transactional use cases. |\\n9.00\\n“Vector search is the cheat code for building apps that feel like magic-instantly surfacing the right answer, every time.”\\nReal-World Impact: Why Everyone Wants This Stack\\nI’ve seen the transformation firsthand. In high-scale environments, AI systems that connect fragmented knowledge—across wikis, docs, chat logs, and support tools—unlock real speed. Instead of toggling between ten systems, teams get context-rich answers in one place. It’s not just convenient—it’s how decisions get made faster, customers get helped sooner, and work gets done with clarity.\\n-\\nEnterprise-Grade Security: Protect PII, comply with HIPAA/GDPR, and control what your LLM sees\\n-\\nProductivity Boost: Employees spend less time searching for information, and more time acting on it.\\n-\\nCustomer Support: Bots that cite your latest policy manual, not Reddit threads.\\n-\\nLegal & Healthcare: Cite real regulations and sources, not hallucinations .\\n-\\nPersonalization: AI that remembers users across sessions and devices.\\n“RAG = AI’s memory upgrade: With RAG, your AI can access your data, not just what it was trained on.”\\nHow a Query Flows (Why It Feels Like Magic)\\n-\\nAsk → “What’s our refund policy for 2025?”\\n-\\nAI embeds the Query → retrieves exact docs.\\n-\\nLLM reads + reasons → grounded answer\\n-\\nYou get trusted answers—not AI guesswork.\\n“RAG is the difference between a chatbot that ‘sounds smart’ and one that is smart-one that can reason, remember, and adapt to your world.”\\nWhat Makes RAG Apps Stand Out\\n-\\nInstant Value: Users get accurate, context-aware answers in seconds.\\n-\\nTransparency: Answers can cite sources, building trust.\\n-\\nPersonalization: The AI remembers you-across sessions, devices, and conversations.\\n-\\nFreshness: No more outdated answers; your AI is always up to date.\\n-\\nSecurity: Keep your secrets safe-RAG can run entirely on your infrastructure.\\n“The future of AI isn’t just about bigger models-it’s about smarter memory.”\\nCode That Connects It All\\nWant to see how this works in practice? Here’s a high-level look at how a RAG pipeline comes together (conceptual, not copy-paste):\\nThis is the “brain” in action: every answer is grounded in your actual data, not just the LLM’s training.\\nBuild the AI App Everyone Wishes They Had\\nIf you want to build the next must-have, enterprise-ready AI app, start with RAG. Power it with a vector database, orchestrate it with frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex, and give your LLM a real brain.\\nRAG is how you move beyond generic AI and build apps that are truly useful, trustworthy, and unforgettable.\\n“Want to build the AI app everyone wishes they had? Start with RAG, power it with a vector database, and give your LLM a real brain.”\\nIf this sparked ideas, share it with your team or network.

Several industry sources told Wells\\nAWS and Microsoft are pausing or slowing down the development of data centers, according to a Wells Fargo research note. Several industry sources told Wells Fargo’s analysts team that AWS has “paused a portion of its leading discussions” on colocated data centers.\\nMicrosoft capex for the quarter came in at $21.4bn this was $1.2 billion less than the previous quarter. This is the first quarterly decline in capex at the company for more than two years, and comes after reports that Microsoft was stepping away from data center projects.\\nMicrosoft has doubled its data center capacity in the last three years and is on track to spend the budgeted amount of $80 billion or more in 2025. Microsoft has more than 350 data centers in at least 60 regions globally.\\nThere has been a focus on Microsoft having “2GW of lease cancellations” but this only covers non-binding LOIs, not firm contracts. Microsoft has ~5GW of pre-leased capacity under binding contracts that will start operations between 2025 and 2028. In reality, Microsoft walked away from significantly more than 2GW of non-binding contracts over the last 2 quarters. The firm was in discussion with virtually every single vendor for capacity in mid-2024 and has since completely frozen new leasing activity.\\nSemianalysis shows the estimated leased data center activity.\\nMicrosoft has significantly ramped up its self-build efforts. They have acquiring tens of thousands of acres around the US and the globe, accelerating construction of existing sites and securing gigawatts of power for future sites .\\nDespite a 1.5GW self-build pause and a freezing of all new leasing activity, there is still a lot of Microsoft data center activity for equipment suppliers like Vertiv.\\nIn April, 2025 Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE: VRT), a global provider of critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2025. Vertiv reported first quarter 2025 net sales of $2,036 million, an increase of $397 million, or 24%, compared to first quarter 2024. Organic orders growth remained strong with TTM orders up ~20% compared to the TTM period ended March 2024, demonstrating continued robust market demand. First quarter orders increased ~13% compared to the first quarter 2024 and increased ~21% sequentially from the fourth quarter 2024. First quarter 2025 book-to-bill ratio was ~1.4x and backlog increased to $7.9 billion, growing ~10% from the end of fourth quarter 2024.\\nVertiv sales by region.\\nAWS continues to see strong demand for both generative AI and foundational workloads. AWS has 114 availability zones and plans for 12 more in 36 global regions that serve 245 countries and territories. An AWS spokesperson told PYMNTS that availability zones refer to a cluster of one or more discrete data centers. AWS does not disclose its actual data center count.\\nOther major data center owners — Meta, Google and Oracle — remain “active” while Nvidia is showing “elevated activity.” This does not include the $500 billion Stargate project to build artificial intelligence data centers, which is a partnership among OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX, plus technical alliances with other companies. It also does not include Apple’s own data center plans, which are ramping up over the next four years.\\nGlobal data center capacity is expected to grow at 15% per year until 2027, which is forecast to be insufficient to meet growing demand, according to real estate services company JLL.\\nIn 2023 and 2024, more than 500 new data center projects were announced in China. At least 150 were operational by the end of last year\\nBrian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month. His blog Nextbigfuture.com is ranked #1 Science News Blog. It covers many disruptive technology and trends including Space, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Medicine, Anti-aging Biotechnology, and Nanotechnology.\\nKnown for identifying cutting edge technologies, he is currently a Co-Founder of a startup and fundraiser for high potential early-stage companies. He is the Head of Research for Allocations for deep technology investments and an Angel Investor at Space Angels.\\nA frequent speaker at corporations, he has been a TEDx speaker, a Singularity University speaker and guest at numerous interviews for radio and podcasts. He is open to public speaking and advising engagements.\\nMicrosoft and Amazon are beginning to realize there is a big difference between public demand and economic demand – that is, what people demand for free vs. what they can pay for. Most AI use is for free, or is bundled like Grok with the X platform where it may be part of the premium package, but undefined and lower than it takes to justify the Capex. They are adjusting their Capex to meet the economic demand. The rest of the providers will soon follow or go out of business; most don’t have the alternate income sources Microsoft and Amazon have. 2025 will be the year revenues have to start exceeding Capex – i.e. profits – for companies that have no other revenues. So the projections beyond 2025 are meaningless.'}\n",

Half promise to revolutionize content, the other half are trying to turn your grocery list into a TED Talk.\\nIt’s a firehose of demos and LinkedIn threads.\\nAnd somewhere in that mess, a few companies are doing the unthinkable: making money.\\nOne of them is Creati: a real, working business pulling in more than $10m in ARR. And there’s a lot to learn from that success.\\nThe AI Hype Cycle (a.k.a. The Graveyard of Good Ideas)\\nEveryone’s got a hot take, a weekend project, and a landing page. But most of these tools collapse even quicker than they’re propped up because they never answer the one question that matters: “What’s the problem this actually solves?”\\nCreati’s founder, Ella Zhang, learned this the hard way.\\nHer first product, an AI image generator, clocked 7 million MAUs. Great on paper.\\nBut those users weren’t paying. And they weren’t staying. Turns out, “Look what AI can do!” isn’t a business model. It’s a science fair project.\\nThe Pivot: Talk to Your Users, Not Your VC Deck\\nHere’s where Creati pulled a move that shouldn’t be radical but somehow manages to be here in 2025: they asked their users what they actually wanted.\\nWild stuff, I know.\\nAfter interviewing over 300 people - 300 real conversations, not just SurveyMonkey hits - they learned that their audience wanted AI that helped them look good: marketers, e-comm sellers, creators, brand managers.\\nNot just flashy outputs, but branded, on-message, plug-and-play content.\\nSo Creati made a hard pivot: they became an element-based video generator, letting users upload their own brand assets (think products, faces, backgrounds) and drop them into slick, pre-built AI video templates. No prompt engineering. No rolling the dice with random generations. Just “put in your stuff, get something useful back.”\\nConversion rates went from 5% to 50%.\\nThat’s not an A/B test win—that’s a holy sht* moment.\\nThat’s, dare I say, product-market fit.\\nDon’t Be Afraid to Charge\\nHere’s a lesson I learned the hard way: traffic is a vanity metric; revenue keeps the lights on.\\nCreati stopped treating their product like a toy and started charging based on business value—save time, make content that converts, stop throwing money at agencies.\\nSimple pitch. Better results.\\nThey dropped the freemium handcuffs and put their faith in actual utility.\\nFast forward within a year: over $10 Million in annualized revenue.\\nTurns out, people will pay when you solve a real problem.\\nBuilding Product-Led Virality\\nA lot of startups talk about growth loops and network effects. Most of them are wishful thinking dressed up as diagrams. Creati actually executed.\\nEvery video their users created was ready-made for social media. Every share was a free ad.\\nAnd because Creati also partnered with skilled creators to build their template library, they got a second loop: when a creator shared their work, they brought their audience with them.\\nThat’s a compounding flywheel between creator and brands. Most SaaS companies would kill for that kind of baked-in distribution.\\nWhat AI Founders Can Actually Take Away from All This\\nIf you’re building in the AI space and hoping to do more than go viral on Product Hunt, take a beat and ask yourself:\\n- Are you solving a real problem, or just demoing magic tricks?\\n- When’s the last time you actually talked to your users?\\n- Are you afraid to charge? (You shouldn’t be. People taking out their wallets is the only way to determine if there’s a market.)\\n- Is your product easy to share? (Word of mouth is still undefeated.)\\n- Can you plug into existing workflows instead of asking people to learn something new?\\nCreati didn’t get here because they built cooler tech: they won because they listened, adapted, and treated revenue like a feature rather than an afterthought.\\nEveryone else? They’re still out there polishing their pitch deck, hoping to get lucky.'}\n",

As oil and gas companies seek AI solutions that align with their operational realities, SLMs present an opportunity to truly capture the power of GenAI.\\nBridging the AI gap in oil and gas\\nOil and gas companies face increasing pressure to optimize drilling, reduce downtime, and maintain compliance while managing vast amounts of operational data. The challenge lies in extracting precise, actionable insights from this data without compromising security, efficiency, or cost-effectiveness. While AI has the potential to help, not all AI models are built for the industry’s unique demands.\\nLLM’s broad, generalized training lacks the precision required for complex tasks such as drilling optimization, predictive maintenance, and emissions monitoring. SLMs, by focusing on industry-specific data, deliver greater accuracy, stronger security, and improved efficiency, making them a more practical and scalable AI solution. SLMs can operate securely on-premises and provide targeted insights that align with oil and gas workflows.\\nOptimizing operations with smarter AI\\nOil and gas companies rely on predictive maintenance and drilling optimization to reduce downtime and improve efficiency. SLMs, when integrated with machine learning (ML), help refine these processes by analyzing seismic data, detecting anomalies, and providing engineers with precise recommendations for real-time drilling adjustments. In asset management, SLMs process data from IoT sensors to detect early equipment failures and support proactive maintenance that extends asset lifespan.\\nMisinformation in AI-generated insights — often called \"hallucinations\" — poses a serious risk in technical industries. By training on verified industry data, SLMs generate reliable and transparent outputs that reduce errors and maintain compliance. Their ability to cite original sources further strengthens trust in AI-driven decision-making and establishes them as a safer choice for oil and gas applications.\\nWhy now?\\nSeveral factors make this the ideal time for oil and gas companies to invest in SLMs.\\nFirst, AI agents are becoming more sophisticated. SLMs now integrate seamlessly with ML algorithms to build up predictive analytics capabilities, which allows companies to analyze drilling performance, optimize production schedules, and detect equipment failures before they occur.\\nSecond, data readiness has improved. Many companies are digitizing operational records, creating a wealth of structured data that can train and refine AI models. With proprietary datasets becoming more accessible, organizations can develop highly customized SLMs that align with their unique workflows.\\nThird, open computing standards are making AI integration more feasible. Edge computing and 5G networks enable real-time AI processing at field sites, reducing latency and improving decision-making speed. These advancements allow AI-powered insights to be deployed where they matter most — in active drilling sites, refineries, and offshore rigs.\\nFurther, SLMs’ modular design allows for incremental expansion, enabling companies to start with specific applications and scale AI usage over time. For example, an initial deployment might focus on automating maintenance work orders. Once proven effective, the same model can be fine-tuned to support asset integrity monitoring or real-time drilling adjustments. By taking a phased approach, companies can maximize ROI while gradually expanding AI-driven efficiencies.\\nFinally, the rise of SLMs is lowering the barrier to entry, allowing smaller and mid-sized companies to compete. Historically, advanced AI solutions have been the domain of major oil and gas corporations with extensive R&D budgets. However, SLMs make GenAI more accessible and cost-effective. As a result, companies without large IT teams can more easily implement AI-driven solutions tailored to their operational needs.\\nWhat’s next?\\nAs the oil and gas industry continues its digital transformation, SLMs will play a vital role in shaping the future of AI adoption. Their ability to provide industry-specific, secure, and cost- effective solutions makes them an invaluable asset for energy companies seeking to be more efficient and maintain a competitive edge.\\nBy leveraging SLMs, oil and gas firms can move beyond generic AI applications and harness technology tailored to their unique challenges. Moving in this direction marks more than just an evolution in AI — it’s a fundamental step toward more innovative, safer, and more sustainable industry practices.\\nAbout the Author\\nDr. Lakshmikantha Rao Hosur\\nSenior Partner – Energy, Resources, and Decarbonization\\nLakshmikantha (Kantha) has over 20 years of consulting experience related to energy and the energy transition across Europe and North America.

Business Insider has verified her work history. This essay has been edited for clarity and length.\\nI\\'ve been doing behind-the-scenes tech work since 2006 — before most people had heard the word \"AI.\" I started as a freelance crowd worker on Amazon Mechanical Turk, doing tasks like tagging photos, transcribing business cards, filing receipts, and checking if websites worked.\\nSince then, the work has really changed, and lots of new platforms have popped up as AI has become more in demand. Now, I do everything from training AI voice assistants and labeling harmful social media content to rewriting chatbot responses and recording speech.\\nI\\'ve never had a full-time job doing this. I\\'m a freelancer, a mom of young kids, and a school board member in Michigan. I\\'ve used platforms like MTurk, Appen, Neevo, Prolific, and Data Annotation, among others. Some projects or tasks pay as much as $40 an hour, but these are hard to come by and can be really competitive to get on.\\nThis isn\\'t my main source of income, like it is for other people in the AI gig work space. It\\'s money for extras like birthday gifts and groceries.\\nI work when I can, usually a couple of hours at night after my kids go to bed. If there\\'s good work available, I try to take it, as you never know when a project will disappear. The flexibility is what keeps me coming back.\\nI spent 3 years mystery shopping Facebook ads\\nThere are a bunch of random tasks that pop up here and there.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nI worked on a mystery shopping project for nearly three years, where I was paid to buy stuff from Facebook ads and report on the quality of the product, whether it was legitimate and matched what the ad had promised.\\nI\\'d log into a dashboard, see an ad, and be told, \"Purchase this if you can.\" I could only skip a product if it was illegal, the ad was fraudulent, or it was a subscription. I didn\\'t get to choose what I bought.\\nThere was a $150 spending cap per product. I was reimbursed for all the items I bought and paid $5 per review. On average, I worked around four hours a month — two hours purchasing, two hours writing reviews, and reviewed around eight products each month. I received thousands of dollars in goods.\\nI ordered all kinds of things: wigs, skincare, Shein clothing, wall art, shoes, sunglasses, and supplements.\\nSome of it was decent — I still use a Bluetooth speaker and a patio deck box I bought through the task. I\\'d occasionally land a designer item: authentic Birkenstock sandals, Adidas sneakers, even Ray-Bans.\\nI kept about half of what I ordered. Lots of what arrived wasn\\'t great, and I got rid of it straight away. Some products were low-quality knockoffs. Others would arrive broken or in weird sizes.\\nI skipped about half the ads I was shown. Some websites were sketchy — spelling errors, no contact info, scammy-looking payment portals.\\nI saved spreadsheets of everything I bought — five to nine items a month for three years. That\\'s a lot of mystery boxes at my door.\\nThe project ended abruptly in February 2024. I just logged in one day, and it wasn\\'t there anymore. I was surprised it had lasted as long as it did.\\nCompared to other gigs, it was low-stakes and kind of fun\\nI\\'ve done a lot of different jobs in this space, and mystery shopping felt simple by comparison. It didn\\'t pay much but was steady and easy to manage.\\nWhen work is really good on one platform, I\\'ll concentrate on that. If work dries up, I move on to my next most successful one, and keep a rotation going.\\nSome of the better-paying work has been voice projects. One had me say hundreds of phrases into a microphone to get it to recognise regional accents, to help train voice assistants like Alexa or Siri.\\nProlific — a platform where you can get paid for completing academic surveys from universities, researchers, or data labelling tasks — has been one of the more consistent platforms lately. It pays between $10 to $15 an hour, but the actual wage can fluctuate. I\\'ve done data annotation projects on Prolific that pay $28 an hour, though those are less common and can be competitive.\\nNot every offer is worth taking. I\\'ve seen projects on some platforms asking workers to install cameras at their front door or wear a pair of smart glasses to provide training data for AI systems.\\nSome ask for at-home videos or selfies sometimes used to train AI facial recognition tools. Some of these come with waivers you have to sign promising that no children will appear in the footage. I don\\'t take those jobs.\\nI mostly stick to what feels reasonable — writing prompts, reviewing, chatbot training, voice work, and data annotating. I\\'d rather not add my face or living room to these systems, as it feels invasive.\\nFor me, it\\'s not about making a full-time income. I just do it when I have time. I like doing this work with young kids because I can go to their events and not worry about being on my computer at a specific time. That kind of flexibility is hard to find anywhere else.'}\n",

Inconsistencies may occur.\\nThe AI boom has triggered a race to secure power for the energy-hungry data centers used to train and operate AI models. While many tech and data center companies are investing in renewable energy and seeking low-carbon sources such as hydro and nuclear power, the need for speedy access to electricity is driving growth in another energy source: mobile generators and turbines powered by fossil fuels.\\nElon Musk\\'s xAI supercomputing facility in Memphis, Tennessee, is the prime example as local environmental groups claim the data center has quickly become a major source of pollution in a city already struggling with dirty air.\\nAs Newsweek reported in August, Musk hired a fleet of mobile gas-powered units to provide electricity for the massive data center while xAI was awaiting a connection to the local power grid.\\nWhile many city officials cheered Musk\\'s multimillion-dollar development, some Memphis citizen groups voiced concern about potential pollution and the lack of transparency or public input.\\n\"There is no permitting process, no tracking, no documentation for what\\'s happening,\" KeShaun Pearson told Newsweek at the time. Pearson, the president of a citizens\\' group called Memphis Community Against Pollution, explained that the xAI site is near a predominantly Black neighborhood that is already burdened by air pollution, and he worried about the emissions from the data center\\'s mobile power units. \"We know what community is going to have to deal with the fallout.\"\\nMore than eight months later, xAI is just now in the process of securing air quality permits for the 35 gas-burning mobile power producers that ring the data center, raising concerns about planet-warming emissions and local air pollution.\\nThe xAI media office did not respond to a request for comment.\\nPatrick Anderson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit Southern Environmental Law Center, has been working with local groups to try to assess emissions from the data center.\\n\"There\\'s been very little public information about what\\'s going on out there,\" Anderson told Newsweek, so SELC did some legwork to gauge the pollution from the data center.\\nThrough aerial photography and emissions information from the turbine manufacturers\\' specifications sheets, SELC was able to estimate the amount pollution such as nitrogen oxides, or NOx, which causes smog. Anderson said the group estimates that over the course of a year the xAI fleet of turbines would spew out somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of NOx.\\n\"Either side of that range would rank them as probably the largest source of NOx in Memphis,\" Anderson said, adding that adding that the xAI facility could be a larger source of the pollutant than the nearby TVA power station or Valero oil refinery.\\nThe xAI facility\\'s size and the lack of public information make it unusual. But Anderson said it is also an example of a growing trend as more data centers add gas- or diesel-powered mobile generators and turbines.\\n\"What is happening here could be what we see more of in the future,\" he said.\\nAnderson said SELC is also monitoring use of mobile turbines and generators in Virginia, which is home to the world\\'s largest concentration of data centers.\\nElsewhere, data center developers finding it hard to hook up quickly to the electric grid are making deals for power on wheels.\\nVoltaGrid, one of the companies supplying power equipment to the xAI facility in Memphis, announced a partnership in February to supply Vantage Data Centers with more than one gigawatt of power—enough electricity to power an average town.\\n\"The sector faces a major hurdle in securing timely power at scale,\" Dana Adams, North America president for Vantage Data Centers, said in a statement. \"Partnering with VoltaGrid is an ideal solution to deploy capacity in constrained power markets.\"\\nVoltaGrid said in a statement that it will emphasize sustainability and emissions controls.\\nAnderson said mobile power units can be equipped with pollution-control technology. But even then, he said, it is a missed opportunity to use clean energy.\\n\"We\\'d rather see this with true renewables,\" he said. \"If there are places in the country where you can\\'t do it with renewables and you have to do it with fossil-fuel combustion, maybe that\\'s not the right place to do it.\"\\nThe mobile-power trend comes as the surging energy demand for data centers presents challenges for power suppliers and climate goals to decarbonize the electric grid.\\nA recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected that global energy demand from data centers will more than double in the coming five years.\\nIn the U.S., the IEA said, electricity use by data centers will likely account for nearly half of the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030.\\nLate last month, Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman introduced legislation they titled the Clean Cloud Act to set emissions standards on the energy data centers use.\\n\"We don\\'t have to choose between leading the world on AI and leading the world on climate safety,\" Senator Whitehouse said in a statement. \"Big technology and AI companies have all the money in the world to pay for developing new sources of clean energy, rather than overloading local grids and firing up fossil-fuel pollution.\"\\nThe bill would assess a fee on large data centers for the power they use if it comes from highly polluting sources and use the revenues generated to assist ratepayers and invest in clean energy sources.\\nHowever, the legislation proposed by two Democratic senators is unlikely to advance in the Republican-controlled Congress, and the Trump administration is encouraging AI developers to embrace fossil-fuel energy sources such as gas and coal to power data centers.\\nLast week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a rule clarification allowing the use of some mobile gas and diesel power sources for data centers. In a statement accompanying the rule, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claimed that the Biden administration\\'s focus on addressing climate change had hampered AI development.\\n\"The Trump administration is taking action to rectify the previous administration\\'s actions to weaken the reliability of the electricity grid and our ability to maintain our leadership on artificial intelligence,\" Zeldin said. \"This is the first, and certainly not the last step, and I look forward to continue working with artificial intelligence and data center companies and utilities to resolve any outstanding challenges and make the U.S. the AI capital of the world.\"\\nThe White House push for fossil-fueled AI could mean much more greenhouse gas emissions will be coming from the data center sector and host cities like Memphis might face more air quality problems.\\nStephen Smith is executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, another nonprofit group tracking the xAI data center\\'s pollution and its permitting process. Smith told Newsweek that xAI\\'s applications for connections to the local electrical grid indicate that the company has plans to greatly expand its computing power and energy needs.\\n\"They are desperately trying to accelerate the interconnection with the grid,\" Smith said, even as the company seeks a permanent air quality permit from local authorities for some of the gas turbines already on the site.\\nSmith said that that as the Trump administration removes federal constraints on AI\\'s energy use, Musk\\'s fossil-fueled approach to rapidly scaling up an AI data center could become the model that other companies follow.\\n\"I think in states like Tennessee and potentially other states that have more lax regulatory regimes, it may very well become the norm,\" he said.\\nAbout the writer\\nJeff Young is Newsweek\\'s Environment and Sustainability Editor based in Louisville, Kentucky.

Unlike English, Japanese doesn’t use whitespace (the spaces between words in a sentence) to separate words, making Word Error Rate (WER) less relevant as a benchmark. Instead, Character Error Rate (CER) becomes the primary metric for evaluating transcription quality.\\nOn top of that, Japanese blends three diverse writing systems-–hiragana, katakana, and kanji–, with hundreds of honorific structures, and shifting pronunciations based on context. For example, the word “three” sounds different when referring to people, flat objects, or animals. Combined with dense domain-specific jargon, these intricacies make Japanese one of the most challenging languages for ASR to master. With the release of Jargonic V2, aiOla continues to break through these barriers.\\nAfter setting new benchmarks in English, Spanish, French, and more, Jargonic V2 now leads in Japanese as well—delivering not just superior transcription accuracy, but also unmatched recall of specialized terms across industries like manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and finance.\\nGoing Beyond Transcription: Why Jargon Recall Matters\\nMost ASR models today are “universal scribes”—trained for broad transcription accuracy but unfit for recognizing the acronyms, product names, and technical terminology found in real-world enterprise settings. That’s where Jargonic stands apart.\\nOur proprietary Keyword Spotting (KWS) technology allows Jargonic to identify domain-specific terms without the need for retraining or manually curated vocab lists. Unlike traditional models, which may stumble when encountering niche or industry-specific words, Jargonic detects them in real-time—thanks to a context-aware, zero-shot learning mechanism deeply integrated into the ASR pipeline.\\nBenchmark Results: Jargonic vs. the Field\\nWe tested Jargonic V2 on two Japanese datasets (both includes all three primary Japanese scripts kanji, hiragana, and katakana):\\n- CommonVoice v.13 – a standard dataset that tests general speech recognition capabilities.\\n- ReazonSpeech – Diverse set of natural Japanese speech, collected from terrestrial television streams.\\nAcross both datasets, Jargonic outperformed Whisper v3, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, and AssemblyAI in key areas:\\nJargonic delivered a 94.7% recall rate for domain-specific Japanese terms—meaning it correctly detected nearly all specialized jargon without training. No other model came close.\\nEven in natural, unstructured Japanese speech (Reazon dataset), Jargonic outperformed every other model—cutting character error rate (CER) in half or better.\\nBuilt for the Real World\\nThese results aren’t just academic. They highlight a fundamental capability for enterprises operating in multilingual, jargon-heavy environments: the ability to capture accurate, structured data from spoken interactions—no matter the language, context, or complexity.\\nWith Jargonic, speech becomes a reliable interface for enterprise AI—not just for transcription, but for real-time understanding and action.'}\n",

That year’s AI-generated snap showed the “Firework” singer in a voluminous ballgown decked out with flowers, matching the 2024 theme of “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” — but again, the dress, much like Perry’s attendance at the past two Met Galas, was not real.\\nThat didn’t stop the former American Idol judge’s mom from falling for it last year. At the time, Perry shared a screenshot of a text from her mom that said, “Didn’t know you went to the Met … what a gorgeous gown,” to which the singer had replied, “Mom, the A.I. got you too, beware.”\\nThough Perry was not at the Met this year, countless other stars — from Rihanna to three-fourths of BLACKPINK, Doechii, Sabrina Carpenter and more — were. Co-chaired by A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton and Colman Domingo, this year’s theme paid tribute to “the role of sartorial style in forming Black identities, focusing on the emergence, significance and proliferation of the Black dandy,” according to Vogue.\\nAs Perry mentioned, she’s currently on the road in support of her 2024 album, 143. The Lifetimes Tour kicked off April 23 in Mexico City; she’s now gearing up for a U.S. leg starting Wednesday in Houston.'}\n",

From finding the perfect role to apply to, to acing the interview, you need to do a lot of prep work to maximize your chances of landing the role. On Wednesday, LinkedIn introduced new AI tools to make the job-search process more intuitive and easier to navigate. The best tools are highlighted below -- and you won\\'t want to skip them.\\nAI-Powered Search\\nThe first step in the job-search process is finding openings that fit your expertise and expectations. Typically, this process starts with a keyword search for the kind of opening you want. To refine your results, you would likely toggle on a few filters to narrow down location, place, educational background, and more. Now, you don\\'t have to.\\nAlso: Only 8% of Americans would pay extra for AI, according to ZDNET-Aberdeen research\\nAI-Powered Search allows users to type into the job search bar using natural language. For example, instead of having to type in \"AI Editor\" as a job, which typically leaves out adjacent roles such as writer and reporter, I was able to type in \"Role that involves writing about AI at the senior level based in the New York City area,\" and received instant, filtered results:\\nSome of these roles wouldn\\'t have come up with a traditional keyword search, such as \"Senior Industry Thought Leadership Lead.\" Because of my wording, which used the term \"writing\" instead of \"reporting,\" the results showed me a ton of roles I may not have known I was a good fit for otherwise, but that do align with my interests and experience.\\nThere are also more adventurous searches, such as LinkedIn\\'s example: \"I want to use my brand marketing skills to help cure cancer.\" Although it may seem like there is limited overlap, LinkedIn search results found marketing roles at hospitals where the job searcher could apply their skills for a purpose that aligns more closely with their goal:\\nThe possibilities are endless, as you can search for roles in specific industries, skillsets, locations, interests, and more. Ultimately, this approach allows job seekers to find more jobs that may be a good match. I have been covering LinkedIn\\'s AI feature additions for a while, and this tool seems to be one of the most impactful and exciting yet.\\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)\\nPersonalized AI Coaching\\nFace-to-face interactions are pivotal to career growth, from interviews to salary negotiations to promotion requests. To help users prepare, LinkedIn Learning\\'s expanded AI-powered coaching feature allows LinkedIn Premium subscribers to engage in mock conversations with AI about topics of interest.\\nMany AI tools on the market can converse with users, such as ChatGPT Advanced Voice, Gemini Live, and Copilot Voice. The LinkedIn experience is different because you get actionable feedback based on the company\\'s insights. Users even get LinkedIn Learning course suggestions to help them work on their skills for the future.\\nImproved Insights\\nWhen clicking on a job, users will find the new and improved job match feature, which provides insights into the user\\'s compatibility with the job role to give them a real idea of how likely they are to succeed.\\nAlso: LinkedIn gets its own suite of video tools as it grows video presence on platform\\nLinkedIn says premium subscribers have access to more insights, including job match ratings and suggestions for how to stand out. New hiring insights are available for every job to show verifications, response times, and whether companies are actively reviewing candidates.\\nFree courses\\nBeyond being a networking platform, LinkedIn is a great learning platform with a robust course offering. LinkedIn Learning offers 1,500 courses on AI alone, and the organization is making the top 10 most popular AI courses free to all users through the end of May. Recent grads will also have access to essential job-seeking courses for free through June 30.'}\n",

Rather than manually checking each vacancy to see if it matches their skills and interests, users can instead specifically search for the ideal jobs that they qualify for.\\n”AI is changing the way we work, and job search on LinkedIn will completely change the way people find their next opportunity,” LinkedIn career expert Zara Easton said in the company’s press release. “Our hope is that this way of discovering roles — and even new careers — will bring together job seekers’ skills, interests, and aspirations to find their next step.”\\nThe AI-powered search is available in English to all LinkedIn Premium subscribers starting today, and is expected to roll out for all members who have their language set to Global English by the end of the week.'}\n",

But in the race to ship products and features faster, some AI startups are encouraging–and in some cases, requiring–employees to work 6 or 7 days a week, Forbes exclusively reported. Among them are some of the buzziest like hiring platform Mercor and customer service-focused tool Decagon.\\nNow let’s get into the headlines.\\nBIG PLAYS\\nOpenAI’s complicated restructuring endeavors have taken yet another turn. The company announced that its nonprofit parent will continue to have control over ChatGPT and other products, a reversal of an earlier announcement that it would not. OpenAI plans to go ahead with converting its structure into a public benefit corporation to continue raising capital and remove caps on investors’ returns. The decision comes after it faced staunch opposition from former cofounder and rival Elon Musk, as well as a number of former employees, who claimed that OpenAI was straying away from its original mission.\\nBack in 2015, OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab, but the recent popularity of ChatGPT sparked an AI arms race in Silicon Valley that has resulted in more demand for its tools. To meet that demand, OpenAI announced a $40 billion investment from Softbank and others, $30 billion of which is contingent on the company’s restructuring.\\nAI DEALS OF THE WEEK\\nIdentity verification startup Persona raised $200 million in Series D funding led by Ribbit Capital and Founders Fund, reaching a $2 billion valuation. The company is helping companies OpenAI, LinkedIn, Reddit and DoorDash ensure that their users are real and who they say they are— an increasingly challenging task as billions of bot surf the internet with the rise of AI agents.\\nDecagon, which is building AI agents for customer service, is in talks to raise $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation, Forbes exclusively reported.\\nCybersecurity startup Doppel is developing AI agents to automatically flag hundreds of malicious ads and fake accounts for businesses like Notion, and has raised $35 million in new funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners.\\nOpenAI has agreed to buy AI-powered coding tool Windsurf (formerly Codeium) for $3 billion, Bloomberg reported. The company was featured on the 2024 Forbes Next Billion Dollar Startup List and the Forbes AI 50 list this year. The news comes as Cursor, one of the hottest AI tools of the year, has closed a $900 million round at a $9 billion valuation, the Financial Times reported.\\nDEEP DIVE\\nEntrepreneurs often create products to cater to niche problems in a specific industry. But for Stack AI cofounder Bernard Aceituno, the opposite is also true.\\nHis company is creating chatbots and AI agents that can automate a broad buffet of back office jobs across functions like finance, HR and customer support, doing things like processing RFPs, reviewing contracts, conducting audits and helping train staff. Today, its users have created some 100,000 agents with it, Aceituno claims. These are already in use within some 200 organizations including Nubank as well as one defense agency (Aceituno did not specify which.) Local government agencies in California, Texas and Massachusetts are using Stack’s artificial intelligence systems to pour through piles of documents and extract data that can then be used for a bunch of other tasks, “cutting middle management bottlenecks,” Aceituno said.\\nAceituno claims his company’s AI agents are helping healthcare companies with constrained budgets and staff crunches, deal with thousands of inquiries. Government contracts are using them to fill out dozens of applications with just 20% of the workforces.\\nThe company announced Tuesday it has raised $16 million in Series A funding led by Lobby Capital.\\nAceituno, who previously built visual-based machine learning models at Meta, says “AI models are trapped behind Jupiter notebooks.” With Stack AI, enterprises can connect their agents to their internal documents and databases and use off the shelf model from over 30 providers.\\nOriginally from Venezuela, Aceituno first experimented with GPT 3 to summarize parts of his own PhD thesis at MIT. He believes tech stacks should be more versatile and applicable to a wide host of tasks. He claims his company offers a platform with the building blocks that can be customized based on the task at hand, while taking data security and privacy into account.\\n“We want to be the Excel of the world,” he says.\\nMODEL BEHAVIOR\\nAI companies have deployed a slew of so-called “reasoning” models that appear to break down problems into a series of logical steps to produce an answer. But it turns out these advanced systems are more prone to generating errors and making up false information (also known as hallucination), than the previous generation of models, according to The New York Times. For newer AI models, hallucination rates can reach as high as 79%.'}\n",

Without such training, they say, kids risk falling behind in a world driven by technology.\\nKey Facts\\nLeaders signing the open letter include CEOs of such high-profile companies as Adobe, Accenture, AMD, American Airlines, Blue Origin, Cognizant, Dell, Dropbox, IBM, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft, Salesforce, Uber, Yahoo and Zoom.\\n“In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future — to be AI creators, not just consumers,” the letter says.\\nIn an AI-driven economy, widely available computer science and AI courses are the fastest way to shrink skill and wage gaps, and to keep the U.S. ahead in the global AI race, the letter says.\\n“Change is already underway,” it reads. “This movement has bipartisan support from leaders on both sides of the aisle. In the past 10 years, all 50 states have taken steps forward, and 100,000 teachers have started teaching computer science.”\\nThe letter cites research from the Brookings Institution showing that just one high-school computer science course can increase lifetime wages by 8% and employment odds by 3%. It says young women and low-income students see the biggest gains.\\nTwelve U.S. states currently require students to learn basic computer science, but business leaders who signed the letter are pushing for far more. “We have a responsibility to prepare the next generation for the new American dream,” the letter says. “We owe it to them to provide an education that reflects the demands of our time.”\\nNews Peg\\nThis week, the United Arab Emirates announced that it will implement an AI curriculum across all levels of public education in the next academic year. In doing so, it joins Brazil, China, South Korea and Singapore, all of which have already made computer science or AI mandatory for all students.\\nOn April 23, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that seeks to foster U.S. AI literacy from a young age through grants for training computer science and AI teachers, public-private partnerships to enhance classroom resources and a national AI-education task force to track progress and gaps in K-12 computer science and AI.\\n“Early learning and exposure to AI concepts not only demystifies this powerful technology but also sparks curiosity and creativity, preparing students to become active and responsible participants in the workforce of the future and nurturing the next generation of American AI innovators to propel our nation to new heights of scientific and economic achievement,” says the order titled “Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American Youth.”\\nWhy The Open Letter Matters\\nWhile some parents and educators worry that popular generative AI tools like ChatGPT could promote cheating and undermine students’ critical thinking and writing skills, the involvement of so many top executives in the conversation about AI and the classroom spotlights both the potential benefits of artificial intelligence literacy for youth and the growing push to make it a core part of U.S. education.'}\n",

On the software side, Microsoft Photos and Paint promise impressive new AI-powered image editing features and tools.\\nIn dual blog post announcements, Windows released news of a one-two punch for software and hardware poised to advance computing innovation.\\nLast May, Windows introduced the Copilot+ PCs, which are touted as the fastest, most intelligent, and secure computers yet. Chasing the ever-growing advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), today Windows announces the general availability of exclusive AI experiences “Recall (preview), Click To Do (preview) and improved Windows Search across Copilot+ PCs.”\\n“AI is no longer a buzzword — it’s changing how we tackle problems, with as many as 76% of consumers today using AI to get help with hard tasks,” Microsoft says.\\n“Today, customers can experience features like Cocreator in Paint, Restyle Image, and Image Creator in Photos to bring their ideas to life in seconds. With Windows Studio Effects, live translations with Live Captions and flexible commands in Voice Access, it’s never been easier to collaborate and communicate effectively across any application.\\nNow, with the availability of Recall, improved Windows search and Click to Do, we’re adding even more AI benefits, making it easier to pick up where you left off, find what you’re looking for, and do more with less time and hassle.”\\nPhotos, Paint, and Snipping Tool\\nMicrosoft’s Photos app will soon get the ability to relight, adding up to three additional digital light sources to enhance or correct troublesome images. The tool will have auto presets for fast editing, or the ability to fine-tune with manual adjustments to the color and focus point of the light sources.\\nNot to be forgotten, the tried-and-true Paint app, which has gotten a lot of attention since its dance with death in 2017, is also receiving new features with support for object selection and the ability to create custom digital stickers based on text prompts.\\nThe popular Snipping Tool will also be improved with a text extractor, color picker, and the option to have screenshots adjusted automatically, creating a tighter crop around content. The Snipping Tool will do so by analyzing the screen with AI to focus on what appears to be the predominant content, with the ability to fine-tune the AI’s initial selection. Object select will use context-aware selections via AI to highlight and isolate elements on the project’s canvas for “targeted edits like moving, erasing, or applying generative fill, without manually tracing or outlining.”\\nRecall\\nWith Recall, Microsoft promises to address common frustrations by transforming how users search for and rediscover content on their personal computers. Recall retraces the user’s steps to securely find and get back an app, website, image, or document by scrolling through the user’s timeline or just by “simply describing the content that you do remember, the feature will search and find it for you.”\\nMicrosoft shared that privacy and security are extensive considerations and that Recall is an opt-in experience with several privacy controls, such as Windows Hello sign-in, data encryption, and isolation. To help keep data safe and secure, it is also processed locally on the user’s device, it is not sent to the cloud or shared with Microsoft, and Microsoft explicitly states that it will not share Recall data with third parties. Users can also opt out, and Recall can be entirely removed from a user’s device.\\nImproved Windows Search\\nMicrosoft shared that they have also improved Windows search with the ability to now describe conversationally what you’re looking for, and Windows will use AI to understand and find it for you. This improved Windows search understands the contextual meaning of words and phrases, making the search experience more natural and intuitive. The feature is made possible locally, again not sent to the cloud, via the Copilot+ PCs specialized chip designed to accelerate AI-intensive tasks with 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second) neural processing unit (NPU) such as the Intel’s Lunar Lake (up to 48 TOPS) or AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 Series (up to 50 TOPS).\\nMicrosoft explains, “On Copilot+ PCs, it can take up to 70% less time to find an image and copy it to a new folder using improved Windows search than using traditional search on a Windows 10 device.”\\n“Whether you’re using File Explorer, the Windows Search box or Settings, you can describe in your own words what images, documents or settings you are looking for, and improved Windows Search will comb through files and data to find it for you.”\\nClick to Do\\nMicrosoft’s Click to Do feature, available now, promises to streamline workflows by allowing users to stay in one app. The company says Click to Do “provides contextual shortcuts to relevant actions like summarizing, rewriting, or simply copying any text or images you see on screen.”\\nTo activate Click to Do, select Win+Click, swipe from the right on a touchscreen device, or look for the Click to Do icon in popular Windows tools like Start, Snipping Tool, and Print Screen, to initiate a window revealing actions available based on the current content on the screen.\\nSurface for Business Copilot+ PC\\nTo keep up with the latest advancements in AI, Microsoft has announced the expansion of its Surface for Business Copilot+ PC portfolio with two new devices, the 12-inch Surface Pro and the 13-inch Surface laptop.\\n“As today’s most advanced AI models intersect with growing economic pressures, the need for secure, high-performance, AI-ready Windows 11 PCs has never been greater. At Microsoft, we’re committed to helping businesses unlock the full potential of AI. Last year, we introduced Copilot+ PCs: the fastest, most intelligent and most secure Windows PCs ever built. Designed to leverage both local and cloud-based AI,” Microsoft says.\\n“We’ve been listening closely to our customers — especially IT decision-makers and business leaders — who are asking for more portable devices that empower employees to stay productive and secure, whether they’re in the office, at home or on the go.”\\nBoth new devices feature the latest Snapdragon X Plus processor with an integrated NPU (neural processing unit) delivering 45 TOPs (trillion operations per second) of local AI processing power.\\nSafety & Security\\nBoth devices are fully built in line with Microsoft’s new Secure Future Initiative, with Windows 11 Pro protecting against phishing, malware, ransomware, and other threats with enhanced security tools utilizing advanced technologies.\\nWindows Hello for Business allows organizations to protect against credential theft for Peace of Mind via Advanced Authentication safeguards, a fingerprint reader, and facial recognition via the built-in Windows Hello Camera.\\nMicrosoft also states that, “the Surface Pro features a built-in NFC reader that supports security keys like the YubiKey 5C NFC, enabling fast, passwordless sign-in with phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication.”\\n“Beyond Windows, every layer of a Surface device, from chip to cloud, is maintained and protected by Microsoft, providing customers with ultimate control, proactive protection and peace of mind.”\\n“Copilot+ PCs feature the Microsoft Pluton security processor, a chip-to-cloud technology embedded directly into the CPU, ensuring Zero Trust principles at the core. Pluton protects sensitive information like passwords, user identities and encryption keys, acting as a secure vault within the computer. Pluton receives regular updates directly from Microsoft, ensuring it always has the latest security features and protections against evolving threats,” Microsoft says.\\nSurface Laptop for Business, 13-inch\\nMicrosoft’s new 13-in Surface laptop for business is designed for professional-level mobility — thinner, lighter, 50% faster performance, with double the battery life, and more USB ports then the previous Surface laptop 5. Mobility is further supported as Microsoft addresses common trouble spots by adding anti-reflective touch screens for readability in all lighting conditions and a strong yet lightweight aluminum chassis for strength and reliability.\\nMicrosoft promises its new 13-inch Surface laptop is “designed for Surface accessories like the STM Dux Shell Case and UAG Plyo Series Case that offer drop-tested durability without adding bulk.”\\nBuilt for professionals on-the-go, the video calling experience has been improved, it’s best yet in a Surface laptop, with an AI-enhanced 1080p front-facing camera with auto HDR, AI noise reduction, and Windows Studio Effects.\\nMicrosoft says that the 13-inch Surface offers “up to 10 hours of battery life on a Microsoft Teams video call” and “features the longest battery life of any Surface device, with up to 23 hours of video playback and 16 hours of active web browsing helping employees stay productive on the move without worrying about outlets or chargers.”\\nSurface Pro for Business, 12-inch\\nUsers requiring an even more petite device will be excited to hear that the new 12-inch Surface Pro is Microsoft’s finished and lightest Copilot+ PC yet and features laptop-to-tablet versatility.\\n“It’s a device as versatile as your team, designed to adapt to almost any environment with features like an adjustable kickstand and a brilliant anti-reflective display. Accessories designed for Surface meet the needs of a wide range of industries and scenarios — including rugged cases, Point-of-Sale solutions and privacy screens from partners like Kensington, The Joy Factory and UAG,” Microsoft says.\\nIn tablet mode, Microsoft states that the device includes features to dictate ideas with voice input, flip through reports with touch, as well as instantly take notes via the pen, which can now be stored and charged securely in the back of the device.\\nThe 12-inch Surface Pro also supports a full desktop experience for maximum productivity. Microsoft encourages users to, “Attach the new Surface Pro 12-inch Keyboard[viii] for an incredible typing and touchpad experience, and use a dock to connect dual 4K monitors[ix] and all the accessories teams rely on throughout the day.”\\nAvailability\\nFor its latest software feature enhancements, Microsoft says, “These exclusive experiences for Copilot+ PCs are available via the April 2025 Windows non-security preview update. Over the next month, we will be gradually rolling out these new features via controlled feature rollout (CFR) to consumers.” Whereas the new hardware, Surface for Business devices, will ship starting July 22 in select markets.\\nImage credits: Microsoft'}\n",

Learn More\\nFrench AI startup Mistral has raised boatloads of private funding but has yet to crack the top AI usage charts globally, especially when it comes to enterprise and developer adoption.\\nBut that may change starting today: The company just unveiled Le Chat Enterprise, a unified AI assistant platform designed for enterprise-scale productivity and privacy, powered by its new Medium 3 model that outperforms larger ones at a fraction of the cost (here, “larger” refers to the number of parameters, or internal model settings, which typically denote more complexity and more powerful capabilities, but also take more compute resources such as GPUs to run).\\nLe Chat Enterprise is a ChatGPT-like assistant and competitor built from the ground up for data protection, auditing, and cross-application support\\nAvailable on the web and via mobile apps, Le Chat Enterprise is like a ChatGPT competitor, but one built specifically for enterprises and their employees, taking into account the fact that they’ll likely be working across a suite of different applications and data sources.\\nIt’s designed to consolidate AI functionality into a single, privacy-first environment that enables deep customization, cross-functional workflows, and rapid deployment.\\nAmong its key features that will be of interest to business owners and technical decision makers are:\\n- Enterprise search across private data sources (your company’s Google Drive, SharePoint, Gmail, and more, without exposing or releasing information to third-parties)\\n- Document libraries with auto-summary and citation capabilities\\n- Custom connectors and agent builders for no-code task automation\\n- Custom model integrations and memory-based personalization\\n- Hybrid deployment options with support for public cloud, private VPCs, and on-prem hosting\\nLe Chat Enterprise supports seamless integration into existing tools and workflows. Companies can build AI agents tailored to their operations and maintain full sovereignty over deployment and data—without vendor lock-in.\\nThe platform’s privacy architecture adheres to strict access controls and supports full audit logging, ensuring data governance for regulated industries. Enterprises also gain full control over the AI stack—from infrastructure and platform features to model-level customization and user interfaces.\\nAnd given the general suspicion from some Western companies and governments around China and its growing library of powerful open source models from companies there, coupled with Mistral’s location in the European Union and the tight data protection laws it must follow (General Data Protection Regulation aka GDPR and the EU AI Act), Mistral’s new Le Chat Enterprise offering could be appealing to many enterprises with stricter security and data storage policies (especially medium-to-large and legacy businesses).\\nMistral is also rolling out improvements to its Le Chat Pro and Team plans, targeting individuals and small teams looking for productivity tools backed by its language models. All tiers benefit from the core capabilities introduced in Le Chat Enterprise.\\nMistral Medium 3 outperforms GPT-4o and even Claude 3.7 Sonnet on key benchmarks and is available via API and on-prem\\nMistral Medium 3 introduces a new performance tier in the company’s model lineup, positioned between lightweight and large-scale models. It is a proprietary model, meaning unlike previous Mistral releases, it is not available under an open source license and must be used through Mistral’s website and API or that of its partners.\\nDesigned for enterprise use, the model delivers more than 90% of the benchmark performance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, but at one-eighth the cost—$0.40 per million input tokens and $20.80 per million output tokens, compared to Sonnet’s $3/$15 for input/output.\\nBenchmarks show that Mistral Medium 3 is particularly strong in software development tasks. In coding tests like HumanEval and MultiPL-E, it matches or surpasses both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT-4o models.\\nAccording to third-party human evaluations, it outperforms Llama 4 Maverick in 82% of coding scenarios and exceeds Command-A in nearly 70% of cases.\\nThe model also performs competitively across languages and modalities. Compared to Llama 4 Maverick, it has higher win rates in English (67%), French (71%), Spanish (73%), and Arabic (65%), and leads in multimodal performance with notable scores in tasks like DocVQA (0.953), AI2D (0.937), and ChartQA (0.826).\\nMistral Medium 3 is optimized for enterprise integration. It supports hybrid and on-premises deployment, offers custom post-training, and connects easily to business systems. According to Mistral, it’s already being used in beta by organizations in sectors such as financial services, energy, and healthcare to power domain-specific workflows and customer-facing solutions.\\nMistral Medium 3 is now accessible via Mistral’s La Plateforme API and Amazon Sagemaker, with support coming soon to IBM WatsonX, NVIDIA NIM, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Cloud Vertex.\\nMeanwhile, Le Chat Enterprise is available in the Google Cloud Marketplace, and will launch shortly on Azure AI and AWS Bedrock.\\nFor those ready to explore the assistant experience, Le Chat is available at chat.mistral.ai, as well as in the App Store and Google Play Store, with no credit card required to get started.\\nBy combining a high-efficiency model with a customizable enterprise platform, Mistral AI is making a concerted push to lower the barriers to scalable, privacy-respecting AI adoption in the enterprise world.'}\n",

It’s your IT team, or your AI platform engineers, serving models behind an API gateway to empower developers and, by proxy, all users so they can use AI in their day-to-day tasks.\\nBuilding and evaluating new artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is critical for long-term technological success, but it’s not the whole picture. At Red Hat, we also spend time creating reusable patterns and refining the way AI models can be consumed. We do this so we, and our customers, can adopt AI with confidence.\\nWe're also making sure that we don't lose sight of the practical side of AI. For example, how in the world are we going to give everyone private access to AI models while minimizing costs? How can we harness the value and scale of the “next big thing”?\\nOne key answer: Models-as-a-Service (MaaS).\\nNot everyone wants to be an AI expert, and let’s be honest, no organization needs everyone building their own models. For now, the goal should be enabling as many people as possible to use the AI we already have. That’s where MaaS comes in.\\nHere’s how we landed on MaaS. Our users tend to fall into two groups:\\n- AI enthusiasts—the AI builders, developers, dabblers and pros who live and breathe AI\\n- Everyone else—those who just want to use AI without diving deep into the technology\\nMaaS is an approach to providing AI models as consumable resources—in the form of API endpoints—to your organization. It’s your IT team, or your AI platform engineers, serving models behind an API gateway to empower developers and, by proxy, all users so they can use AI in their day-to-day tasks.\\nThink about it this way—the AI giants don’t give you access to their hardware. You get access to their app or API endpoints. They provide MaaS. The only difference is that in this situation, instead of renting their services, you run your own MaaS to maintain control over costs, access and speed of innovation.\\nSounds pretty great, right?\\nIt is! We’ve been running MaaS internally at Red Hat for about a year now. Here’s what we noticed:\\nMore innovation with reduced costs\\nEvery time a new model comes out, hundreds of Red Hatters want to deploy it immediately. MaaS helps us deploy the model once and preserve our budget! Gone are the days of sourcing 10, 20, 50+ GPUs because 10, 20, 50+ people want to try a new model.\\nIt’s a win-win. Our developers can try new models and focus on building new tools without breaking the bank.\\nSpeed to innovation\\nWe are able to test any new model hitting the market on our own timeline. Remember when DeepSeek disrupted the AI market? We had DeepSeek R1 running and available for everyone shortly after its release. Same for Granite, Llama 4, Phi—you get the picture.\\nPrivacy and security\\nSensitive data requires full and careful control. With MaaS, you become your own private AI provider able to closely safeguard your digital assets. You're not obligated to use public-facing API endpoints. In fact, many of our customers run their own models in fully air-gapped data centers.\\nEnterprise use\\nThe API gateway powering MaaS gives you the scalability you need to reach every associate, the flexibility you need to keep pace with innovation and the enhanced security and observability tools you need to efficiently deploy AI models on your terms.\\nReduced costs, again\\nMaaS reduces costs by directly using a shared resources model. You’ll find that fewer GPUs are required to achieve the same result, and GPU utilization metrics will improve. As models get better and smaller over time, you’ll get even more from this footprint. You could even use open source large language model (LLM) compression tools to balance model performance and size to suit your own requirements. In short, MaaS helps you to optimize your footprint and your models for maximum gain.\\nMaaS is about creating the right foundation while preparing for the future. Take AI agents for example. Agents aren’t one-shot, question-and-answer applications. They’ll keep searching for the answer, if you let them. What does that mean? Tokens. So many tokens. If you want scalability and the ability to more accurately project your costs, you should consider running MaaS in house.\\nAI is here to stay, and it’s time to get practical about cost, speed of innovation and privacy. Models-as-a-Service is a promising solution and one Red Hat is committing to. If these are also priorities for you, MaaS is worth considering.\\nCheck out this interactive demo where Parasol, a fictitious insurance company, powers three AI applications using MaaS!

Users can enter their preferences using natural phrases like “I want something funny and upbeat” or even more detailed requests, such as “I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny.”\\nThe feature is set to roll out this week to iOS users as an opt-in beta.

Occasionally, a seagull will swoop in and perch atop the roof for a few minutes. But for the most part, nothing happens.\\nOn Wednesday, the College of Cardinals started the process of picking the next pope, who will succeed the late Pope Francis. This is a closed-door, sacred ritual, dating back long before mass media made it possible to quickly transmit news with so much public interest. So instead of issuing statements to the press, the conclave signals its progress to the public via smoke — black if they have not agreed on a new pope, and white if they have come to a decision.\\nWhile the smoke signal used to be for the benefit of local onlookers, there are now dozens of global broadcasters streaming 24/7 coverage of the Sistine Chapel’s exterior online. There is no narration from a television host — only the ambient noise of the packed city square, and perhaps a smattering of seagull calls.\\nIn a time when YouTubers strive to optimize every last frame of their videos to boost their chances of viral fame, the mundanity of “conclave cam” is oddly awe-inspiring.\\nIt feels like an extension of the Nordic “slow TV” trend, where public networks broadcast commercial-free footage of dull, yet calming scenes. For hours or days at a time, viewers can watch salmon swimming upstream, trains journeying across the countryside, or moose migrating to their summer habitat.\\nWithin the context of YouTube, the surrounding user interface of these “conclave cams” is familiar — the unmoderated live chats move quickly, like a popular creator’s livestream. But unlike a Fortnite Battle Royale, there’s not really much to talk about in the chat. The chimney might emit black smoke, or it might emit white smoke. For the vast bulk of the broadcast, the most exciting moments occur when a bird flies through the frame.\\nBut because it’s the internet, people end up arguing about politics, soccer, and Elon Musk. There’s some nasty language thrown in there. In some cases, viewers will buy superchats — bold blocks of text that are more noticeable in a busy chat — to declare their vision for the future of the Catholic Church.\\nTechcrunch event\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Instead, what’s alluring is the quiet.

Now it’s strengthening its partnership with Google Cloud by launching Nutanix Cloud Clusters, or NC2.\\n“Google’s providing a bare metal service and we’re able to take advantage of that, extend our cloud cluster solution to that and provide customers with more choice and which hyperscale they wanna work with,” said Michal Lesiczka (pictured, left), vice president for cloud and databases partner ecosystem at Nutanix.\\nLesiczka and Kelly Ciccone (right), head of sales for Silicon Valley Enterprise, Google Cloud, at Google LLC, spoke with theCUBE’s John Furrier and Bob Laliberte at Nutanix .NEXT, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed Nutanix’s collaboration with Google Cloud and what is next for both companies. (* Disclosure below.)\\nThe modern cloud cluster solution\\nNutanix Cloud Clusters, currently available for preview, is designed to simplify hybrid multicloud infrastructure through a single, software-defined platform. The offering supports companies trying to modernize legacy systems, often based on VMware, by allowing them to easily migrate applications and data across clouds.\\n“We’re enabling you optionality,” Lesiczka said. “There’s a set of customers that are taking a big bet with Google Cloud. So, there was this huge demand, pent up demand, for making sure that we’re offering that. I think the biggest news is that we’ve enabled your ability to migrate, modernize with Google Cloud.”\\nAnother factor is, unsurprisingly, AI. At this year’s conference, Nutanix announced integration with Nvidia Corp.’s AI tools, and last year, it launched Nutanix Enterprise AI. Nutanix’s cloud offerings can meet the needs of AI adoption, according to Ciccone.\\n“Customers have data on-prem. they’re using Google for training and they might be using AWS for inferencing,” she said. “This is an opportunity for Nutanix to be that management layer. They have the prowess with the management aspect of it, the simplicity, and then we’ve got the robust infrastructure and of course the AI innovation to enable and accelerate those AI workloads.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of Nutanix .NEXT:\\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for Nutanix .NEXT.

Later in April, Huang said at a tech conference in Washington, D.C., that China is “not behind” in AI, and that Huawei is “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”\\nShares of Nvidia are down about 15% so far this year after almost tripling in 2023. The company is set to report earnings on May 28. Analysts expect to see revenue growth of 65% from a year earlier to $43.1 billion, according to LSEG. While Nvidia is still expanding much faster than its megacap peers, growth is slowing, as the company reported a revenue increase of more than 260% a year ago.\\n“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,” Huang said on Tuesday. “Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”'}\n",

But he also says that AI could help narrow the technology divide and boost global GDP. Hear more of his comments in the video above.\\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here.\\nAll of you have heard a lot about, about job displacement. Uh every job will be affected. Uh some jobs will be lost, some jobs will be created. Uh but every job will be affected. And immediately, it is unquestionable, you\\'re not going to lose a job, your job to an AI, but you\\'re going to lose your job to somebody who uses AI. But let me give you and those are, those are fairly common sense things to, to, to, to have observed. But let me give you two extremes that you might want to consider as well. Uh\\ncomputer technology, computer science has benefited about 30 million people. There are about 30 million people in the world who knows how to program and use this, use this technology to its extreme. And it\\'s really benefited all of us that have been in this industry the last 30 years. Uh potentially one of the best and most, most wealth creating industry you could have selected. I could have, I could have been a petroleum engineer. My dad was and I could have been, I could have been a doctor. My mom thinks everybody should be a doctor and but I chose, I chose uh to, to go into computer engineering and it turned out to have been quite a good, good choice. Um and and however, however, there are about 30 million people like in, in this industry. Um and so we\\'ve created, like in the last, you know, 30, 40 years, probably the greatest technology divide the world\\'s ever seen. The, the instrument that we\\'ve invented, uh, we know how to use, but, but the other eight, seven and a half billion people don\\'t. Um\\nI, I\\'ll, I\\'ll put on the table that in fact, artificial intelligence is the greatest um, opportunity for us to close the technology divide and then let me prove it to you. You know, if we just look in this room, it\\'s very unlikely that more than a handful of people know how to program with C++. Um and uh and equal, equal number know how to program in C. Um and yet, 100% of you know how to program an AI. And the reason for that is because AI will speak whatever language you want it to speak. You could draw a schematic and show it to it. You could draw a picture and ask it what to do. Um you could, you know, obviously talk to it in, in words. You could, you could write a prompt. Uh you could describe your prompt in a very explicit way. You could describe your prompt prompt in a very implicit way. Uh and if you don\\'t know how to program that computer using AI, you just tell the AI, I don\\'t know how to program you. How do I program you? And the AI will tell you exactly how to program you. And and program it. And so I think that, that um and the number of people who are using chat GPT and Gemini Pro and uh these AIs kind of demonstrate that in fact, this is one of the easiest to use technologies in history. And so now all everybody could take advantage of this capability, whether there\\'s a teacher or a student wanting a tutor and every student should use it as a tutor. I use it as a tutor every day. And so I think the, the ability for us to now use artificial intelligence to close the technology gap is incredible. So that\\'s one extreme.\\nThe other extreme that I will say is that remember, uh we\\'re we have a shortage of labor. We have a shortage of workers. We don\\'t have an abundance of workers. We have a shortage of. And for the very first time in history, we actually have, we can imagine the opportunity to close that gap, to put 30, 40 million workers back into the workforce, um that otherwise, otherwise the world doesn\\'t have. And so you could, you could argue that artificial intelligence is probably our best way to increase the GDP, the global GDP.\\n-\\nBarclays Global Head of Fixed Income Syndicate Peter Toal discusses investment grade credit, private credit, tariffs, and M&A activity.

We\\'re watching Nvidia, Super Micro Computer and Uber. First off, let\\'s talk in video. CEO Jensen Huang says that the market for AI chips in China could reach $50 billion in the next couple of years here. Speaking at the Milken Institute conference this week, Huang spoke on why it\\'s important not to restrict the flow of AI chips to countries like China, saying it would help bring back tax dollars to the US and create jobs. Shares of Nvidia here during today\\'s session. You\\'re seeing those up by about 1/10th of a percent, so some fractional gains here. Uh his exact words were ultimately China, well, the Chinese market in a couple years is probably about 50 billion dollars. The market we\\'ve left behind, utterly gigantic and compared it to the likes of Boeing. Um, Boeing, I think last I checked their market valuation somewhere around 140 billion dollars. But you get the picture.\\n01:48 Speaker BYeah. Yeah, no, definitely. And it\\'s interesting actually to see Nvidia just above the flat line, especially given that we\\'re up on the day thus far. kind of curious to see why it\\'s not more of a lift, especially off the back of those earnings from AMD, which did indicate. Yeah. Well, it was a bit of a wild ride for AMD, which we\\'re going to talk about, but they did indicate continued strength in demand, which would be a positive catalyst for the likes of Nvidia having said that, of course, AMD did warn of tariff concerns. So that of course is also a concern for the likes of Nvidia. And you could see that playing out in the price action here. Those shares at $113 right now. Next up, Super Micro Computer cutting its full-year outlook citing economic uncertainty and none other than tariffs delaying at customer orders. The server maker reporting fiscal third quarter results that came in below analyst expectations, but we\\'re in line with preliminary results released by the company last week. Super Micro also issuing disappointing guidance for its current fourth quarter. You can see those shares down 6%, which is really interesting because of what I just said. They gave the audience a preview of the show. They said last week. This is going to be a tough one, guys. And yet it wasn\\'t necessarily priced in, at least to the degree of weakness that they did signal when cutting this full-year outlook here.\\n03:57 Speaker AYeah. And kind of mixed reception from what we\\'re seeing, at least in some of the analysts that cover this name as well. Uh, you\\'ve got some initiation of coverage from Needham. They resumed their coverage, I should say, positive outlook by rating price target, $39. Elsewhere on the street, you\\'ve got a lowering of the price target from Rosenblatt and their price target has been adjusted essentially to uh $50. So that\\'s just down from $55. So there\\'s still net bullish on it, just kind of remodeling and, you know, being sensitive with exactly what\\'s been set forth and how the rest of the street is perceiving some of the cut to this full-year outlook as well.\\n04:58 Speaker BAbsolutely.\\n05:00 Speaker AAlso here, let\\'s talk a little ride sharing. Uber missing first quarter revenue expectations and first quarter gross boosting booking estimates as ride share growth slows. Still revenue grew 14% year over year, taking a look at the shares right now. They are down by about 2.9%. Uh, pre-market here as we\\'re waiting for trading to begin. Of course, the CEO Dara Kosrowshahi offering a little bit more context and color of how he\\'s looking at uh, this quarter supported by the consistent growth, strength of their core business. Uh, they continue to build towards the future. Five new autonomous vehicle announcements just in the last week, he reminds as well. Um, also, $2 billion of quarterly free cash flow with multiple levers in their control to generate industry-leading cash flow growth. That coming from the CFO.\\n06:15 Speaker BYeah, it\\'s interesting that falling shy of anticipated revenue growth seems to be the sticking point here, given that just a year ago, Uber had a loss in their quarterly report here. Their net income around $1.78 billion or 83 cents a share for the first quarter here. That is up from a net loss of $654 million a year earlier. So certainly seeing that recovery. You can see that playing out in the price action on your screen here over the course of the last year. What\\'s interesting to me is we talk constantly about whether or not we\\'re in an economic slowdown phase and we didn\\'t see huge signs of that in Uber\\'s report here and also in terms of the analyst commentary talking about how they do see strong consumer demand going forward for this name.

Take a listen.\\n00:14 Dana SettleI\\'d say for the last decade, 15 years, I mean, um, everything that we were investing in, we\\'d say, is there a global TAM for that? And I think, you know, then it was sort of, was there a global TAM, maybe less China. And now it is sort of, well, jeez, you really do have to be the the winner in the US at least. And I think, um, I, you know, we do believe that some of these markets are bigger than they seem, especially, again, in AI because they they are they\\'re taking what historically was sort of like the software revenue, say, for a given area, let\\'s say for, you know, CRM. And now they\\'re actually moving up the stack into some of the services. And so they\\'re probably bringing onshore some of those services and building them into kind of the the platform, if you will. And so, um, you know, I think some of the markets and the domestic markets are expanding, but I also, like, having very, you know, in venture, we have a very long-term perspective. And so what I guess will happen is things will change again.\\n02:10 Brian SozziWell, in this backdrop, are you willing to pay up to own growth, or now you have to question those growth rates of certain businesses in this backdrop?\\n02:49 Dana SettleI, I mean, I think that the growth that we\\'re seeing, specifically because of like the full re-platforming that\\'s happening, is is so significant. I mean, I, you know, I\\'ve never seen, um, growth rates like this in my career. I mean, I don\\'t think anybody has.\\n03:13 Brian SozziWhat are you looking for in that next amazing tech leader?\\n03:22 Dana SettleSo, it really depends. I mean, just as a a reminder, we we have three separate strategies. So we have a an AI strategy, which I\\'ve maybe mentioned a few times. We have a consumer brand strategy, and then we also have a sustainability strategy that we do in partnership with Coca-Cola and eight of its bottlers globally. And um, and so in each of those areas, I\\'d say the the one thing that is important for any company right now is are are they thinking about what artificial intelligence means to their business? And so that would be across any of them. And in terms of leader, really, we are looking for leaders that either are technical or or have technical leaders as part of the founding team. I think it\\'s that important. And if there\\'s an AI native company, really, they have to be able to attract the most incredible, you know, sort of technical talent, research minds, you know, in the world. And so we are looking for founders that are deeply technical, but but that are able to attract and also really think through a commer like think commercially. I think, you know, if you look at OpenAI and I think what they\\'ve managed to do, the technology side of it is is is incredible, but in some ways, the go-to-market is what\\'s even more impressive. And I think that\\'s taking, you know, taking pages out of playbooks from, you know, AWS and, you know, from Google Cloud and sort of from what all these companies, these hyperscalers have managed to do, but just applying it at at a rate that, you know, is is pretty unprecedented.\\n05:26 Brian SozziThink someday OpenAI\\'s the most highly valued company in the market?\\n05:36 Dana SettleI think it could be.\\n-\\nIn This Article:\\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is getting a raise — his first base salary pay bump in a decade.

We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time,\" wrote Daniel Stenberg, original author and lead of the curl project, on LinkedIn this week.\\nCurl (cURL in some realms), which turned 25 years old in 2023, is an essential command-line tool and library for interacting with Internet resources. The open source project receives bug reports and security issues through many channels, including HackerOne, a reporting service that helps companies manage vulnerability reporting and bug bounties. HackerOne has fervently taken to AI tools in recent years. \"One platform, dual force: Human minds + AI power,\" the firm\\'s home page reads.\\nStenberg, saying that he\\'s \"had it\" and is \"putting my foot down on this craziness,\" suggested that every suspected AI-generated HackerOne report will have its reporter asked to verify if they used AI to find the problem or generate the submission. If a report is deemed \"AI slop,\" the reporter will be banned. \"We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help,\" Stenberg wrote.\\nAnswering unasked questions\\nOne report from May 4 that Stenberg wrote \"pushed me over the limit\" suggested a \"novel exploit leveraging stream dependency cycles in the HTTP/3 protocol stack.\" Stream dependency mishandling, where one aspect of a program waits for the output of another aspect, can lead to malicious data injection, race conditions and crashes, and other issues. The report in question suggests this could leave curl, which is HTTP/3-capable, vulnerable to exploits up to and including remote code execution.\\nBut as curl staff point out, the \"malicious server setup\" patch file submitted did not apply to the latest versions of a Python tool in question. Asked about this, the original submitter responded in a strangely prompt-like fashion, answering questions not asked by curl staff (\"What is a Cyclic Dependency?\") and included what seem like basic instructions on how to use the git tool to apply a new patch. The submitter also did not provide the requested new patch file, cited functions that do not exist in the underlying libraries, and suggested hardening tactics for utilities other than curl. Curl coders eventually closed the report, but also made it public to serve as an example.'}\n",

It’s clear to everyone now that this kind of infrastructure is going to be the backbone of future economic growth and national development. Technological innovation has always driven growth by helping people do more than they otherwise could—AI will scale human ingenuity itself and drive more prosperity by scaling our freedoms to learn, think, create and produce all at once.\\nWe want to help these countries, and in the process, spread democratic AI, which means the development, use and deployment of AI that protects and incorporates long-standing democratic principles. Examples of this include the freedom for people to choose how they work with and direct AI, the prevention of government use of AI to amass control, and a free market that ensures free competition. All these things contribute to broad distribution of the benefits of AI, discourage the concentration of power, and help advance our mission. Likewise, we believe that partnering closely with the US government is the best way to advance democratic AI.\\nToday, we’re introducing OpenAI for Countries, a new initiative within the Stargate project. This is a moment when we need to act to support countries around the world that would prefer to build on democratic AI rails, and provide a clear alternative to authoritarian versions of AI that would deploy it to consolidate power.\\nIn response to these interested governments, OpenAI is offering a new kind of partnership for the Intelligence Age. Through formalized infrastructure collaborations, and in coordination with the US government, OpenAI will:\\n- Partner with countries to help build in-country data center capacity. These secure data centers will help support the sovereignty of a country’s data, build new local industries, and make it easy to customize AI and leverage their data in a private and compliant way.\\n- Provide customized ChatGPT to citizens. This will help deliver improved healthcare and education, more efficient public services, and more. This will be AI of, by, and for the needs of each particular country, localized in their language and for their culture and respecting future global standards.\\n- Continue evolving security and safety controls for AI models. As our models become more powerful, we will continue to make investments in the processes and controls, including the data center and physical security needed to deploy, operate and protect them. As part of AI safety, it is critical to respect democratic processes and human rights; we are excited to collaborate on future directions for global democratic input to shape AI.\\n- Together, raise and deploy a national start-up fund. With local as well as OpenAI capital, together we can seed healthy national AI ecosystems so the new infrastructure is creating new jobs, new companies, new revenue, and new communities for each country while also supporting existing public- and private-sector needs.\\n- Partner countries also would invest in expanding the global Stargate Project—and thus in continued US-led AI leadership and a global, growing network effect for democratic AI.\\nAs OpenAI moves forward with OpenAI for Countries, our goal is to pursue 10 projects with individual countries or regions as the first phase of this initiative, and expand from there.\\nWe look forward to engaging with interested countries through their representatives in the US and through our executives based in our offices around the world.'}\n",

The ring can make recommendations for the user's next meal based on health objectives.\\nThe other new AI-driven feature is glucose tracking, but you can't use it without buying a $99 two-pack of Stelo glucose biosensors to take advantage of it. Each sensor can be worn for 15 days. Stelo is not for adults who are on insulin or at risk for hypoglycemia.\\nBy linking with the sensor, which is worn on the back of a user's arm, the Oura app will provide 24/7 glucose tracking. The app will contextualize that tracking alongside mealtimes, sleep, stress and other activities that can raise or lower your blood sugar.\\nOura Advisor pulls together data from the new AI features alongside other Oura app information to provide sleep, readiness and activity recommendations.\\nThere's no extra charge for the new features, beyond the glucose sensor.

As AI adoption surges, companies are prioritizing architecture that aligns with specific use cases, delivering smarter performance, lower costs and greater trust across hybrid and multicloud environments.\\nKey conversations across the industry now center on aligning hardware and software roadmaps, scaling AI while managing total cost of ownership and preparing for next-generation technologies such as quantum computing. The collaboration between SAS Institute Inc. and Intel Corp. reflects these priorities, emphasizing workload-specific acceleration, ethical AI practices and human-centered design that ensures confidence in real-world outcomes, according to Muge Tanik (pictured, right), general manager for AI solutions and partnerships at Intel Corp.\\n“There was a misconception in the marketplace that all the AI workloads work on GPU only and also gen AI equals GPU, which is not correct,” Tanik explained. “We look at the frameworks, we look at the data type, the accuracy of the data, we look at the inference performances. Our platforms have shown very promising and competitive results on all these platforms. We are extremely excited and proud.”\\nTanik and John Carey (left), vice president of global channels at SAS, spoke with theCUBE’s Rebecca Knight at SAS Innovate, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how SAS and Intel are advancing AI through optimized intelligence, shifting beyond GPU-first thinking to deliver workload-specific performance, cost efficiency and future-ready innovation. (* Disclosure below.)\\nSAS and Intel advance AI with optimized intelligence\\nSAS and Intel’s 25-year partnership is built around optimized intelligence, with both companies investing deeply in technical alignment to ensure hardware and software co-evolve. By integrating Intel’s silicon innovations, such as AMX acceleration, trusted compute and Gaudi GPUs, SAS delivers consistent, cost-conscious performance on Viya, its AI and analytics platform. This relationship enables clients to deploy advanced models across sectors such as financial services and public sector without overspending on infrastructure, according to Tanik.\\n“We have this roadmap alignment, but AI is the key focus for us,” she said. “Viya has been showing great performance on [the] latest Intel platforms. We have seen like [a] 24% performance increase of Viya for the speed test, and we have seen [a] 94% increase of Viya performance on throughput tests.”\\nAt the engineering level, SAS and Intel maintain a feedback loop that allows SAS to shape chip design before finalization. This iterative co-development ensures real-world needs are considered before products hit the market. SAS’s R&D teams use Intel’s latest hardware to unlock new parameters for AI acceleration, allowing faster deployment of models that drive business value, without requiring customers to overhaul their existing infrastructure unless absolutely necessary, Carey explained.\\n“When these guys send over hardware to our R&D, it’s like Christmas morning,” he said. “These are the gifts that keep on giving because they allow our team to get really excited about the new parameters that they can open up, the new acceleration, how they can solve those problems and take full advantage of all of the new innovation that Intel is doing on the chip set.”\\nThis hands-on, customer-first approach underpins both firms’ belief in a flexible, consultative AI roadmap. Rather than pushing high-powered GPUs by default, SAS and Intel assess customer goals, workload types and existing investments to offer tailored solutions, whether that means CPUs, accelerators or hybrid cloud infrastructure.\\n“One size does not fit all. Everything starts with the workload, and everything starts with what pain points that customer is trying to solve,” Tanik said. “We offer alternatives to the customers and we meet them where they are.”\\nHere’s the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of SAS Innovate:\\n(* Disclosure: TheCUBE is a paid media partner for SAS Innovate.

To get up to speed, she pulled up Salesforce\\'s Agentforce AI tool in Slack, typed in \"EV contractors,\" and received a dossier of previous sales, call recordings, and industry trends.\\n\"I don\\'t have a vertical, so I\\'m no industry expert in regards to electric vehicle contracting,\" Gault said. \"That\\'s a way for me to really quickly get up to speed on who this customer is. What were the previous conversations with Salesforce? Who are the key stakeholders?\"\\nGault isn\\'t alone in harnessing AI tools for her sales role. When McKinsey asked about 1,500 companies about how they used generative AI, sales and marketing were the most common responses.\\nDan Gottlieb, Gartner\\'s vice president analyst for sales, told Business Insider that sales professionals are an industrious group of self-starters who are actively searching for new AI use cases. They use artificial intelligence to compile research, develop leads, and even hone their pitching skills, Gottlieb said.\\nBut the increasing implementation of AI in sales raises the question: Could this integration diminish the power of human connection? Corporate selling is, after all, a fundamentally human process that relies on relationship building, typically via phone calls and client dinners.\\nAt Salesforce, its 25,000 sellers use AI tools to improve their human approach to sales, not erase it, Connor Marsden, the company\\'s North America president of industrial, consumer, and energy, told BI.\\nHow AI can bolster seller goals\\nThe Columbia Business School professor Michael Brown said he\\'d noticed some sales professionals worrying about whether AI is dehumanizing the selling process.\\n\"I don\\'t know any buyer who wants to be sold to by a copilot,\" Brown told BI.\\nHe added that there would always be client-buyers who want to have in-person conversations with sellers about pricing, discounts, and legal agreements. At the same time, Brown said he had a positive outlook on AI\\'s expansion to sales processes, so long as it continues to enhance worker performance.\\nTo do that, sellers should think about applying AI to their daily unstructured tasks, like client research, brainstorming how to approach a particular situation, and making sense of large amounts of information quickly, Gottlieb said.\\nGault, for example, has shared parts of her favorite sales-related book with Salesforce\\'s autonomous AI agent, Sales Coach. After Gault input passages from \"Never Split the Difference\" by the former FBI hostage negotiator Christopher Voss into her agent, it offered her advice based on Voss\\' techniques, like to acknowledge customers\\' emotions when they express frustrations.\\nWith Sales Coach, Gault said she could role-play and get a critique of her performance to prepare for client meetings.\\nGault, who works remotely from Pittsburgh, said these AI-powered tools help her prepare for customer interactions because she often lacks in-person colleagues to role-play with and receive feedback from.\\nThe evolution of AI use at Salesforce\\nAI isn\\'t new in Salesforce\\'s operations, but its utility continues to change, Kris Billmaier, the executive vice president and general manager of Sales Cloud and growth products at Salesforce, told BI.\\nHe said the company had invested in predictive and assistive AI tools, as well as autonomous AI agents.\\nFor autonomous AI, Billmaier used the example of updating client statuses in Sales Cloud, Salesforce\\'s platform for tracking sellers\\' statuses for each of their clients, from generating leads to closing deals. He said Salesforce\\'s predictive AI used to make status-update recommendations based on its analysis of a sales lead\\'s communications. To complete the process of approving and recording the status change, sellers had to review the AI\\'s recommendation, then manually click \"accept.\"\\nBut as sellers became more acquainted with the AI\\'s suggestions, Salesforce began to use autonomous agents for that process. Now sellers can set up an agent to approve their status changes without human intervention.\\nAI adoption requires employee awareness and accessibility\\nBringing AI to a workplace so dependent on human connection is no easy feat. Marsden said it\\'s a \"new motion\" many sellers aren\\'t used to.\\nHe said a solution is to ensure that AI-powered features are \"living and breathing\" in the tools that sellers use every day.\\nWhen, for example, a customer tells Gault that they\\'re using HubSpot, a competing marketing software, she looks to the right-hand corner of her screen. There, her Sales Coach autonomous AI agent is already populating ways other sellers have tackled objections from HubSpot users.\\nSalesforce sellers can also find Slack\\'s AI chatbot among their options for colleagues to message.\\n\"There\\'s a baked-in incentive for them to be really good at using AI so they can come across authentically in front of their customers,\" Marsden said.\\n\"The human side is having the conversation, doing the discovery, and inquiring about what the customer\\'s needs are,\" he said. \"And then AI is there to complement, to help you make sure you captured all the needed feedback.\"'}\n",

Salespeople use the data in a CRM to inform their revenue generation efforts. Data about a customer’s past purchases, for example, could be used to personalize an upselling campaign. CRM data can be also useful in other areas including customer support.\\nServiceNow’s entry into the CRM market is not unexpected. The company hinted at its plans in January after reporting fourth quarter earnings. When ServiceNow announced its $2.8 billion acquisition of Moveworks Inc. in March, it stated that deal would help enhance its CRM capabilities.\\nServiceNow CRM will ship with a set of AI agents designed to reduce manual work for workers. According to the company, the agents will place particular emphasis on automating sales and customer service tasks. Depending on the complexity of a given task, they either complete it automatically or route the request to a human.\\n“Far beyond rebranded chatbots, we’re enabling our customers to orchestrate end‑to‑end sales and service on a single AI‑powered platform, helping organizations manage the entire customer lifecycle with greater efficiency,” said John Ball, ServiceNow’s executive vice president and general manager of CRM and Industry Workflows.\\nThe company detailed its CRM platform alongside two new AI tools. The first, AI AI Control Tower, will enable customers to centrally monitor their AI agents. It’s joined by a tool called AI Agent Fabric that allows AI agents to exchange data with other systems using open-source technologies from Anthropic PBC and Google LLC.\\nLast November, Anthropic released a protocol called MCP that allows language models to perform tasks using external tools. An MCP-powered model could, for example, use a cloud-based code editor to write Python scripts. This past April, Google LLC open-sourced a similar protocol called A2A. It focuses on enabling agents to integrate with one another rather than with tools such as code editors.\\nServiceNow’s new AI Agent Fabric uses A2A and MCP to let agents interact with third-party systems. Those systems can be tools such as code editors or other agents. ServiceNow says that Adobe Inc., Box Inc. and more than a half dozen other companies plan to offer agent integrations for AI Agent Fabric.\\nAI Control Tower, the offering rolling out in conjunction, allows enterprises to monitor all their AI agents in one place. ServiceNow says that the tool can automatically identify cybersecurity and privacy risks. Additionally, it provides dashboards that track business metrics such as an AI agent’s sales impact.\\nAI Control Tower is generally available. ServiceNow is currently testing AI Agent Fabric with early adopters and plans to launch it in the third quarter.\\nImage: ServiceNow\\nA message from John Furrier, co-founder of SiliconANGLE:\\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.\\nJoin our community on YouTube\\nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\\nTHANK YOU'}\n",

Here\\'s a glimpse into their tactics —\\xa0and psyches.\\nLast year, Jesse Cunningham — a self-described \"SEO specialist who leverages the power of AI to drive real results\" — appeared in a livestream for a closed members group for SEO secret-trading. He\\'d been invited to discuss his AI strategies for monetizing content on Facebook, where he claimed to have found financial success by flooding the Meta-owned platform with fake, AI-generated images of things like faux houseplants and ChatGPT-created recipes.\\n\"Don\\'t ban me, people,\" Cunningham jokes into a large microphone, explaining that one of his AI pages had previously been flagged by Meta for violating platform policies after he revealed its name in a public-facing YouTube video.\\nCunningham explains that his preferred groups to target are devoted fandoms and the elderly. The former is easily excited, he posits, while the latter probably won\\'t understand that what they\\'re clicking on is synthetic at all.\\n\"Best are voracious fan bases. Fan boys, fan girls,\" Cunningham tells the group. \"And an older demographic, where Aunt Carol doesn\\'t really know how to use Facebook, and she\\'s just likely to share everything.\"\\n\"I\\'m going after audience 50-plus female,\" he reiterates, explaining that targeting older women on Facebook means his content can be cross-posted over on the aspirational image-sharing-and-sourcing platform Pinterest, the userbase of which is overwhelmingly made up of women.\\n\"Why am I going after females? Because... I want to cross-pollinate the audience,\" says Cunningham. \"I want to kill two birds with one stone and dominate Pinterest and Facebook at the same time. Fifty-plus female is my demo.\"\\nThe recorded call is just under an hour in length. At one point, Cunningham triumphantly declares that he\\'s \"starting new pages in the recipe niche\" and wants \"to disrupt that whole industry\" because, in his telling, it\\'s \"ripe for the taking.\"\\n\"Going back to the AI recipes, do you know if they actually work?\" someone asks Cunningham later in the clip.\\n\"Of course they work. ChatGPT told me they work,\" Cunningham, who looks genuinely baffled by the question, responds. \"What kind of question is that?\"\\nCunningham is one of many sloperators using AI to flood social media with AI content to make money.\\nThe process goes like this. Cunningham publishes large numbers of AI-generated articles to websites helmed by made-up bloggers, with AI-generated headshots, purporting to be experts in topics ranging from houseplants and recipes to DIY holiday crafts and nature scenes. Then he posts AI-generated images linking back to those sites on social, with Cunningham claiming he\\'s able to rake in cash — not by actually putting time and energy into photographing any actual home gardening, or drafting and testing new recipes, but by using AI to quickly and cheaply imitate traditional content creators\\' final product.\\nEvidence of such zombie tactics employed by Cunningham and others are evident on his preferred platforms, Pinterest and Facebook, where users are increasingly made to wade through swamps of parasitic AI slop.\\nAs Futurism reported earlier this year, Pinterest is facing a pervasive influx of AI-generated content masquerading as the real thing. The torrent of AI slop on Facebook is well-documented as well — last year, an in-depth 404 Media investigation revealed that AI slop farmers around the world had figured out how to use AI to generate engagement-bait imagery designed to earn cash by exploiting Facebook\\'s since-shuttered Performance Bonus program.\\nWe highlighted Cunningham in our previous reporting about Pinterest. He\\'s an avid YouTuber, and we were struck by his candor as he publicly shared the sordid details of his slop farming process, which frequently includes copying the work of his competitors — real bloggers and online creators who say the AI influx on Pinterest, Facebook, and other platforms has had a destructive impact on their businesses.\\n\"Across the board, like across the board, this is something that is talked about in blogging groups all the time, because it is devastating all of our businesses,\" Rachel Farnsworth, a veteran food blogger of the website The Stay at Home Chef, told Futurism of the impact that schemes like Cunningham\\'s have had on her industry.\\n\"It\\'s put a ton of people out of business,\" she added.\\nWe decided to dig deeper into Cunningham\\'s extensive content catalog, on YouTube and beyond, where we found a telling portrait of the layers of unreality shrouding the AI slop increasingly crowding the web — and the attitudes of the slopageddon\\'s eager purveyers, down to their eagerness to trick old ladies and copy others\\' work.\\n***\\nAccording to Cunningham, AI offers a way to pretty much print money online.\\n\"Pinterest is one of the easiest ways to make money online right now,\" he declares in a November YouTube video titled \"🤯AI Pinterest Strategy for $15,942/MONTH.\"\\n\"Our goal is to catch fish,\" he adds. He then clarifies: \"fish is making money.\"\\nBut to \"catch fish,\" he emphasizes, quantity — made easy by generative AI tools — is key.\\n\"Ten pins daily is not going to cut it,\" he adds, explaining that he posts around 80 AI pins a day in his efforts to manipulate Pinterest\\'s algorithm — enough to get his pins to \"cruising altitude,\" he says, but not enough to get hit with a spam notice by the platform. \"You\\'re not going to compete with me and the other people doing it at scale.\"\\nBut \"luckily, nowadays,\" he continues, \"we have AI.\"\\nHis process, as Cunningham lays out across his videos, begins by tracking down existing pins that are already doing well.\\nIn the November video, for instance, he homes in on a parenting-oriented blog called The Mummy Front. The blog isn\\'t his; instead, Cunningham seeks to use AI to replicate someone else\\'s viral content at scale.\\n\"So this one here — \\'Andie DIY Ikea Hacks, Crafts to make,\\' blah blah blah blah blah — they crush it for Christmas,\" Cunningham remarks. \"So I can come in here to their Christmas board... and now we\\'re looking around. We can figure out, all right, this is what works with Christmas, because this is a top-five Christmas page on all of Pinterest.\"\\nCunningham then zeroes in on one of The Mummy Front\\'s top-performing pins, which links back to a listicle-style blog post about Christmas wrapping paper ideas.\\nDrawing on that post, Cunningham takes to an AI-powered content creation tool called Content Goblin where, after inputting just a headline into a text box — he requests a post for \"47 Gift Wrapping Ideas You Need To Try for CHRISTMAS\" — he\\'s able to churn out a lengthy listicle in a matter of moments, complete with AI-generated images.\\nThen he uploads the AI-generated blog post, without editing, to a faux blogging site he runs called Bonsai Mary.\\nBonsai Mary is helmed by an \"author\" named \"Mary Smith,\" who features prominently on the site\\'s landing page, along with an AI-generated headshot.\\nDespite its bonsai-focused title, the blog\\'s content is surprisingly wide-ranging — an oddity that its alleged blogger-in-chief, Smith, speaks to in a first-person missive published on its homepage.\\n\"Welcome to Bonsai Mary — this website has been around since 2009! The main focus here is plants but I also love to share recipes and interior decorating things I love,\" reads the webpage. \"My name is Mary Smith, a seasoned gardener and bonsai artist and author of BonsaiMary.com. I love nature and any new plant I haven\\'t seen before!\"\\nBut Smith is clearly not a real person. In addition to her AI-generated headshot, she has no publishing history outside of Bonsai Mary — except for a blog titled Off Grid Dreaming, which is also operated by Cunningham, according to other YouTube videos.\\nWhat\\'s more, though it\\'s technically true that the Bonsai Mary website has been around since 2009, archived versions of the site show that Bonsai Mary was actually founded back in the late 2000s by a woman named Mary C. Miller, a real American bonsai artist and author.\\nIt\\'s unclear when the blog\\'s domain first switched hands. But according to archived snapshots documented in the Internet Archive\\'s Wayback Machine, \"Mary Smith\" didn\\'t appear until late 2023.\\nFinally, to publish his AI-generated images to Pinterest, Cunningham uses ChatGPT to drum up short, Pinterest-optimized descriptions for each image. He throws all of that into a spreadsheet, and using a planning tool, mass-uploads links to his synthetic blog. (In other videos, he uses yet another AI tool to overlay headline text onto AI-generated imagery with little effort.)\\nAnd from there, he says, he\\'s \"cruising.\"\\n\"You,\" he tells the viewer, \"can use all these tools to get a competitive advantage on everyone.\"\\nCunningham creates content for a variety of topics — or \"niches,\" as folks in his industry will say, from cooking and recipes to interior design and decor.\\nThe Pinterest account page for Bonsai Mary, which lists 8.6 million monthly views on its profile, says in its bio that \"we create AI pins and blog posts for all to enjoy.\" The associated profile for Off Grid Dreaming, which lists around 20.2k monthly views, fails to issue a similar disclaimer.\\n\"At Off Grid Dreaming,\" reads its bio, \"we specialize in designing sustainable, off-grid living spaces that blend style, comfort, and functionality.\" (There\\'s no evidence that Cunningham, or \"Mary,\" actually \"specialize\" in anything beyond SEO.)\\nBut you\\'d have to actually visit the Bonsai Mary profile page to see that disclaimer, something not everyone who interacts with an individual pin is going to do. None of the individual pins posted to Pinterest by Cunningham that we\\'ve discovered specifically denote the use of AI through tools like watermarks or text captions. And despite his apparent willingness to broadcast the details of his AI-powered assembly line to other SEOers on YouTube and in members\\' forums, we\\'ve yet to see Cunningham add AI disclaimers to his many AI-generated blog posts or websites.\\nThat appears to be intentional, we found when we signed up for a free, six-episode instructional video series Cunningham offers about his Facebook scheming.\\nIn the second episode, titled \"The Basics,\" Cunningham explains why he prefers to use AI images of fake people on his pages.\\nThe \"three most important parts\" of setting up a Facebook page, says Cunningham, are the page\\'s title, introductory paragraph, and the associated profile picture, the latter of which he refers to as a \"logo.\" Overlaid on the screen is a page called \"Houseplant Community,\" which utilizes the same unreal image attributed to the fake author featured over at Bonsai Mary and Off Grid Dreaming.\\n\"Those all really come into play with user interaction,\" he explains. \"People feel inclined to interact when they see another person... the mind automatically perceives, \\'oh, this is a person posting this, not a page.\\' Therefore, they\\'re more likely to share a post, comment on a post, just engage with a post in general.\"\\n\"So I like having people\\'s faces as the logo,\" he adds.\\nIt\\'s unclear how much money Cunningham actually makes from his AI schemes, and how much of his income comes from people paying him to learn how to create their own AI content. All his videos about Pinterest link back to a paid \"AI Pinterest Masterclass\" that he markets on his personal website, and he also runs a \"private, paid\" members group for Pinterest and Facebook tactic trading.\\nWe asked Cunningham how much of his revenue he derives from his AI content versus how much he brings in through his paid classes and forums, but he didn\\'t respond. Needless to say, if someone did hold a low-effort secret to making enormous sums of money online, especially through practices that some view as unethical and could potentially cause a platform to alter its policies, logic would dictate that they\\'d probably keep it to themself and pull in the cash instead of selling classes as a get-rich-quick scheme.\\nWe also asked Cunningham about the ethics of his strategies on Pinterest and Facebook and his use of fake authors to legitimize social media accounts and synthetic websites, as well as about his practice of targeting older internet users, specifically because of what he perceives as an inability to understand what they\\'re clicking on, but received no response.\\nPinterest and Facebook declined to respond on the record, though both emphasized on background that they\\'re working on systems to better detect and label AI content.\\n***\\nA few days after our initial investigation into Pinterest\\'s slop problem, Cunningham took to YouTube to reflect on why, in his view, AI content on Pinterest is so \"polarizing.\"\\n\"There\\'s a huge problem on Pinterest right now,\" Cunningham tells the camera. \"It has to do with what it has to do with money, because it always has to do with money.\"\\nTo demonstrate his point, Cunningham then goes to Content Goblin to quickly whip up an AI image-smattered listicle for the headline \"Yellow Bedroom Ideas.\" The whole post takes just a few seconds to produce.\\n\"Imagine if you were old school — imagine if you were on this platform, on Pinterest, say three years ago, two years ago... how hard would it be to come up with this bedroom?\" he asks, pausing on an image of a bedroom with a yellow-toned bed. \"The simple bed right here, with the pillows, it\\'d be a pain. It\\'d be very hard to put that on Pinterest, because you\\'d have to go somewhere and take photos... that\\'s a lot of money right there if it was real.\"\\n\"There used to be a huge moat around Pinterest for creators,\" says Cunningham. \"Now, things have changed.\"\\n\"That\\'s the problem,\" he continues. Creators \"used to get tons of traffic, and then people like me started talking about AI on Pinterest, right, that\\'s why they\\'re so angry... there\\'s money here, and we disrupted the flow of money.\"\\nIn the video, Cunningham describes his approach as driving a car — as opposed to traditional creators, who in his view are still riding a horse.\\n\"Old school creators are so angry about AI. Have you ever wondered why that is?\" he ponders. \"It\\'s because it\\'s the intersection of money, and we found the honeyhole. We found where all the money is.\"\\nIn that sense, Cunningham is right: he and others have found a loophole to exploit. AI provides them with a crude shortcut to avoid the overhead — time, money, energy — that comes with making real stuff. For pennies on the dollar, Cunningham can produce more content, and rake in some of the cash that might otherwise be going to the \"old school\" folks behind real, human-made images and blog posts.\\nIt would be naive to suggest that social media has always rewarded helpful quality content, and Cunningham and other slop farmers certainly wouldn\\'t be the first to use seamy tactics to juke online algorithms for profit. But the speed and scale at which AI slop is altering the web as we know it is astonishing — and, in the realm of Pinterest and other social media channels, it\\'s raising real challenges for good-faith creators trying to monetize their online businesses, and making the internet a muddier place to spend time as a user.\\nThat\\'s the reality that Cunningham, across his many videos, fails to grapple with. Sure, a large part of the content creation formula has always been feeding the algorithmic beast, which has often incentivized quantity over quality.\\nIn an ideal scenario, though, there\\'s a genuine exchange of value. An interior designer uploads an image of a real-world yellow-toned bedroom they pulled together, and a user clicks through to their website, earning them some visibility and ad revenue to support their business; the user, meanwhile, finds real-world inspiration and maybe even reaches out for a consult. Or perhaps a Pinterest user lands on a human-made and tested recipe, and by clicking through to the poster\\'s blog, the human who came up with the dish gets a kickback for their work drafting, testing, photographing, and posting their creation.\\nBut in Cunningham\\'s situation, where the social web is awash with fake images that connect back to equally fake blogs, where fake alleged subject matter experts peddle unreal content for engagement and ad revenue? No one, not even \"Aunt Carol,\" really gets anything. Except, of course, the spammers.\\n\"It\\'s devastating to us bloggers, the content creators,\" said Farnsworth, the food blogger. \"We\\'re the people who created the content that\\'s on the internet. And people are just going out of business.\"\\n\"Yeah,\" she continued, a sense of deflation creeping into her voice. \"It\\'s just a bunch of fraud.\"\\nMore on AI and Pinerest: Pinterest Is Being Strangled by AI Slop\\nShare This Article'}\n",

So it “captures hundreds of subtle signals about each payment” that other models would miss, she said.\\nOne use case is improved fraud detection. Stripe’s previous models “gradually” reduced card testing attacks by 80% over two years. Card testing attacks are a type of fraudulent activity in which someone tries to determine whether stolen card information is valid so that they can use it to make purchases.\\nThe company claims that its new foundation model increased its detection rate for such attacks on large businesses “by 64% practically overnight.”\\nShe added, “Previously, we couldn’t take advantage of our vast data. Now, we can.”\\nStripe, of course, isn’t the only fintech to have built a model using AI for fraud detection.

It just performs better and adapts better to changes in fraud patterns.\\nStripe also announced on Wednesday its intent to bring stablecoin-backed, multicurrency cards to businesses by partnering with other startups like Ramp, Squads and Airtm. With such cards, businesses across multiple countries will be able to “operate in the same currency for the first time,” the companies claim.\\nThe move comes just three months after Stripe completed its acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge.\\nWith Orchestration, Stripe said it can better help businesses set up, manage, and optimize performance across multiple payment providers from its dashboard – whether or not they use Stripe as a payment processor.\\nStripe also used the event to name numerous AI companies that use its billing product, including Windsurf, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Perplexity, and Eleven Labs.\\nMore recently, according to Vivek Sharma, Stripe’s head of revenue automation, Nvidia migrated its “entire subscriber base” to Stripe Billing in six weeks – a process that the fintech claims typically takes many months for a business to complete and marked the “fastest-ever migration to Stripe Billing.” (Nvidia was already a customer of Stripe Payments).\\nOther announcements by Stripe on Wednesday included:\\n- Support for 25 new payment methods, including UPI and PIX, bringing its total to over 125 payment methods.\\n- Klarna will be available on Stripe’s consumer payments product Link this summer.\\n- Stripe Terminal can now be used with third-party hardware, starting with Verifone.\\n- Managed Payments, a new merchant-of-record offering that gives businesses everything they need to enter new markets by taking care of global taxes, fraud prevention, dispute management, fulfillment, and more on their behalf.\\n- Smart Disputes, which uses AI to automate disputes handling.\\n- Stripe Tax is now available in 102 countries, up from 57 last year, and automation of the entire tax lifecycle from monitoring and registering, to collecting and filing.\\n- Global Payouts, which allows businesses to pay out to customers, contractors, and other third parties with just an email address.'}\n",

In keeping with that trend, on Wednesday a startup called Sett — which is building AI agents to build and run mobile games — is emerging from stealth with $27 million in funding.\\nThe funding was raised in two tranches, the most recent of which was a $15 million Series A, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Saga VC, vgames, F2 Venture Capital, and Akin Babayigit — the founder and former head of the U.K.-based games unicorn Tripledot, who now heads VC firm Arcadia Gaming Advisors — also invested.\\nEarlier, Sett had raised $12 million in seed funding from F2, Bessemer, and some gaming industry leaders as angel investors.\\n(In a case of uncanny timing, sources tell me that AppLovin, a would-be competitor of Sett’s, is today announcing the sale of its gaming assets to Tripledot.

More on that below.)\\nUp to now, Tel Aviv-based Sett has taken the same approach to “stealth mode” as a lot of other B2B startups.

On average, approximately $29 billion is spent to make around $100 billion in revenue, according to research from AppsFlyer.\\nSett’s solution is an AI agent for game publisher marketing. Extensive user-level tracking is a thing of the past on iOS, so the focus is now on what Carmi describes as “creative content” — in-game and marketing streams of interactive moments built on the aesthetics of the game that aim to draw in users to try out new games, or to play them more.\\nThese “playable” ads and marketing efforts are very catchy at the moment, but they can be very expensive and time-consuming to create, akin to building new versions of the game.\\nThat is where Sett sees an opportunity. What humans previously had to code, place, and measure from the ground up can now be built using Sett, the startup claims, 15 times faster and 25 times cheaper.\\nArcadia’s Babayigit, from his time at Tripledot, knows firsthand how important marketing is for helping games stand out and get played. He described the idea as a “no brainer” in an interview. “It’s just a phenomenal team and an incredibly talented group of people.”\\nThe opportunity that Sett is targeting is also one that has been proven out. The gaming studio assets that Sett’s competitor AppLovin is selling to Tripledot for $800 million were built out in the first place, we understand, in large part to train the AI models that AppLovin now uses across a wide range of ad and marketing tools, including the creation of its own playable ads for customers by way of SparkLabs.\\nNow that the AI models and wide networks of users are established — AppLovin has a market cap of $103 billion, despite a lot of short seller noise — the game studios are no longer core to AppLovin. Meanwhile, AppLovin has its sights set on a much bigger prize: It’s one of the companies that has publicly stated it will bid to buy the global business of TikTok.\\nHow much AI is too much?\\nThere is a big question mark over all the AI services that have the capacity to take over an increasing number of functions previously carried out by humans. How much is too much? Is there even a “too much”? Companies like Agave are already putting some AI into the creative process, and arguably, once the genie is out of the bottle, that could be it.\\nCarmi said while he believes that you will eventually be able to build AI agents to develop and market games end to end, this may not be where Sett settles.\\n“We believe it’s actually a bigger opportunity than what we’re doing now. This is the reason why we built our game engine and the agentic layer in a way that it generates code and enables us to enter all of what we’re doing basically to the game itself,” he said. “The vision of Sett is really taking both the marketing content and in-game content for now.”\\n“I don’t think the genesis is to replace ‘all aspects’ of game design and execution,” Babayigit said.\\n“I don’t even know if that’s possible right now, since to compete in a very crowded area, the bar is SUPER high, so you need to make a game in which the details are SUPER SUPER important. But what I do know is that this team is operating with real technology behind them, so if anyone can make certain parts of game production and distribution automated, it’s them.”'}\n",

Another application by Tesla to trademark the term “Robotaxi” for its upcoming ride-hailing service is still under examination by the office.\\nIn addition, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term “Cybercab” have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar “Cyber” trademarks. That includes one company that has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories.\\nThe USPTO issued Tuesday what’s known as a “nonfinal office action” on the “Robotaxi” trademark application, which means Tesla has three months to file a response or the office will abandon the application. A trademark lawyer representing Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nTesla applied for the trademarks in October 2024 on the same day that it revealed the Cybercab, the purpose-built electric car that it hopes to one day use in its planned autonomous ride-hailing service. Tesla also submitted two similar trademark applications October 10 for the term “Robobus,” which are still under examination.\\nThe trademark that was refused was assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14. Tesla said it would use the word in reference to “[l]and vehicles; electric vehicles, namely automobiles; automobiles; and structural parts therefor,” according to the original application.\\nWhile the USPTO examiner found there were no conflicting trademarks in existence, it refused the application because it was “merely descriptive.” The examiner wrote that the term “Robotaxi” is “used to describe similar goods and services by other companies.”\\n“[S]uch wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant’s goods and/or services,” the examiner wrote.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

A recent article in The Economist questions the assumptions behind AI’s growth, particularly the belief that increased efficiency will automatically lead to greater demand. It challenges what some tech leaders have recently embraced to explain and justify AI’s rise: the Jevons paradox. This economic concept suggests that as AI becomes cheaper and more efficient, we won’t use it less—we’ll use it everywhere. While rebound effects like this do happen in economics, the article argues that a complete Jevons paradox scenario, where efficiency leads to a higher overall usage, is rare.\\nInspired by that discussion, I want to explore a broader perspective: how certain economic and behavioral theories shape the way we think about AI adoption and how Red Hat’s AI strategy fits into the picture.\\nA theoretical approach to understanding the technology adoption lifecycle\\nEvery major innovation, such as electricity, the internet and smartphones, follows the same technology adoption lifecycle curve. First come the innovators, then the early adopters and eventually, the early and late majority.\\nRight now, AI is still early in this cycle. That’s not surprising—in fact, it’s exactly what the early adopter phase looks like. I’ve seen this happen many times at Red Hat. Whether it’s customers experimenting with machine learning (ML) or looking to bring inference into production, early adopters are eager but cautious. They're still validating use cases, assessing architectures and figuring out how to integrate AI into their workflows—classic early adopter behaviors.\\nBut here’s the key: It doesn't mean AI won’t become a standard part of the enterprise stack. It just means we haven’t crossed the chasm yet. When we do, things will accelerate fast.\\nAnchoring bias: early impressions that stick\\nSo what’s holding us back from that turning point? Anchoring bias is part of the story. A lot of organizations still anchor their perception of AI on the earliest, most expensive and complex models (think of the large transformer models requiring huge infrastructure). That initial impression doesn’t go away easily. Even though more efficient, open and specialized AI models, such as DeepSeek, are emerging, many organizations still view AI as “too big,” “too experimental,” “too expensive” or “too enterprise.” Until we challenge that perception, broader adoption will remain out of reach.\\nDeepSeek and the moment of induced demand\\nThat’s where breakthroughs like DeepSeek come in—representing a moment of Induced demand. As AI becomes more efficient and affordable, it won’t just serve existing use cases more cheaply, it will lower the barriers to experimentation and unlock new use cases altogether—from customer service and content creation to healthcare, intelligent automation and AI at the edge. This will be the momentum to push AI from early adoption to mass adoption.\\nThe availability heuristic\\nThe availability heuristic helps explain how this momentum builds. Once people start seeing real-world examples of AI working—especially efficient, targeted cost-effective AI—the perception of AI shifts. It’s not a tech demo anymore; it’s a tool people actually use. The more visible and practical it becomes, the more organizations will feel like they need to get on board.\\nThe Paradox of Choice\\nHowever, even as AI gets cheaper and more accessible, there’s a risk of bottlenecks in decision-making, leading to the Paradox of Choice. Too many frameworks, vendors, architectures and use cases can paralyze decision-makers, especially those outside the engineering core. It's not just about supply and demand—it's also about clarity and confidence in execution.\\nFrom theory to action: how Red Hat simplifies AI adoption\\nThe power of community acceptance in AI adoption\\nAs AI gains traction, organizations look for guidance to make informed choices, often focusing on trusted tools, active communities and expertise that is accessible. While the most visible tools attract early attention, Red Hat focuses on long-term viability. Red Hat doesn’t just follow trends—it helps shape trends into real-world technologies that can support business-critical environments. In an ecosystem powered largely by open source, teams want to build on what’s already proven to work. But as the ecosystem expands, so do choices, making it harder to know what comes next. Fortunately, community acceptance helps guide adoption and point teams in the right direction.\\nDelivering platforms that meet people and data where they are\\nThis is where Red Hat’s AI strategy makes a meaningful difference—and it’s something I’ve come to deeply appreciate in my work. In conversations with customers across industries, I’ve seen how excitement about AI is often matched with hesitation. The technology is powerful, but the implementation path is not always clear.\\nThat’s why Red Hat’s approach resonates so strongly. We don’t just provide infrastructure—we provide clarity in a landscape that’s increasingly noisy and complex. Our focus on open, hybrid and flexible architectures helps remove the friction that slows down AI adoption. Through platforms like Red Hat AI, we offer streamlined, opinionated solutions that work consistently across environments—from the datacenter to the edge.\\nBuilding the open AI ecosystem\\nOur strategy goes beyond platforms. Red Hat is building an open, modular AI ecosystem designed to give organizations the freedom to innovate—without the limitations of vendor lock-in or the chaos of managing disconnected tools. Rooted in our foundational values of interoperability, transparency, freedom and community-driven collaboration, our ecosystem supports everything from open model hubs like Hugging Face to widely used frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. We work across the hardware and software stack to abstract the complexity of AI deployment, orchestration and scaling.\\nIn a world where the Paradox of Choice threatens to slow innovation, Red Hat helps teams reduce the overhead of evaluating and integrating countless tools. We offer an opinionated, curated and security-focused enterprise-grade foundation rooted in open source. We reduce complexity and accelerate time to value and shift the focus to delivering real business outcomes. In that sense, our ecosystem isn’t just open—it’s orchestrated for impact.\\nMLOps meets DevSecOps: turning models into experiences\\nAI models are just one part of the equation—the real experience comes from applications enhanced with AI capabilities. While Red Hat AI provides the foundations for building and serving models, Red Hat OpenShift, as a platform, ties it all together by enabling developers to integrate AI models into production-ready applications using CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows and DevSecOps practices. It’s where application development and AI operations come together to deliver intelligent, scalable experiences.\\nFinal thoughts: beyond the paradox\\nBuilding the future of AI won’t depend only on supply and demand. It will be shaped by creating the right conditions: ecosystems, trust, usability and opinionated design that favor adoption and real-world success.\\nThe Jevons paradox offers a clever economic metaphor, but when it comes to AI, it is only part of the story. Efficiency matters without a doubt, but it isn’t the only factor behind adoption, so are usability, flexibility and trust. The future of AI won’t be dictated by reduced costs or economic analogies alone. It will be shaped by how easily organizations can design, build and scale AI across diverse environments.\\nThe future of AI depends on how intentionally we design the tools, platforms and ecosystems that support it. It’s about how we build everything around those efficient models. And those who shape that intent through openness and user-centered architectures will define what comes next. AI today is not a commodity in the same way coal once was. It’s a dynamic, evolving capability shaped by human behavior, infrastructure maturity and community collaboration.\\nThat’s exactly where Red Hat comes in. While others debate theory, we focus on simplifying AI infrastructure, enabling choice and building open ecosystems that move innovation forward. From our work on Red Hat AI to our collaborations across the open source communities, we’re making AI accessible not just for the few, but for the many—across industries, geographies and levels of maturity.\\nAnd if there’s one thing I’ve learned from working with open ecosystems and enterprise teams alike, it is that technology only matters when people can actually use it.\\n“GenAI presents a revolutionary leap forward for enterprises, but only if technology organizations are able to actually deploy and use AI models in a way that matches their specific business needs.” - Ashesh Badani, Senior Vice President and Chief Product Officer at Red Hat\\nresource\\nOpen the future: An executive’s guide to navigating the era of constant innovation\\nAbout the author\\nMeet the Architect of Influence\\nSince joining Red Hat in 2021, I’ve been working at the intersection of cloud architecture, AI strategy, and customer transformation.

Explore Aleph.im’s decentralized cloud for compute, storage, and AI innovation.\\nChange is inevitable!\\nSo the ancients say and so we've seen in the continuous evolution of technology to solve ever-multiplying human problems.\\nThe information age is upon us, transforming every aspect of our daily lives. The internet has become a global tool for everyday life, with billions of people around the world surfing the web from the comfort of their homes on various kinds of devices. A time traveler from just a hundred years ago would assume the technology of today is magic, best believe.\\nBut innovation never stops, right? Humans have continued to find ingenious ways to change the harsh society we evolved in into a much safer one for us and those who come after us. The everlasting wheels of progress have driven us to the birth of new technologies that are revolutionizing the global internet; this is blockchain technology or Web3.\\nThe current internet is known as Web 2. It is a version of the internet dominated by centralized companies running dynamic websites and applications that enable user interaction. Social media giants like Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, etc., and cloud titans like Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure stand at the helm of Web 2 technology. However glorious Web 2 has come to be, though, it suffers from one fatal flaw: centralization.\\nWeb 2 companies are centrally owned and managed. This means that an entire technology serving billions of people is completely subject to the agenda of a handful of corporations and personal interests. This is not the worst part. This centralization of the technology constitutes a great weakness for the entire system; a singular point of failure.\\nCome with me.\\nSo IT runs on infrastructure, right? I mean the servers, masts, giant cables, satellites, etc. that power what we call the internet. Imagine how much that costs. Definitely too much for the regular Joe on the street, right? Well, very few people can actually afford to set up this infrastructure for platforms like cloud technology. Hence, the industry is already monopolized by money.\\nThis is beside the fact, though, that the main issue is how vulnerable this centralized infrastructure makes the entire system. A single problem in the server, wiring, or software can bring down the entire system. Hence, all that work to make the world a global village can be undone with one single breach.\\nCrazy right? Picture Dormammu - a world-dominating entity - trapped in a time loop.\\nFor those who don't understand the the reference, dormamu is a world eating villain from the Avengers series in the first doctor strange movie. After consuming many planets, dormamu sets its murderous eyes on earth to swallow it and at first sight seems rather unstoppable. However, Dr. Strange stops the monster by with a simple magic trick of trapping it in a time loop. A rather ridiculous ending if you ask me.\\nSo what's the way forward, you may ask? Do we just sit and surf the web, risking our great online arena to one single breach yet to come? Of course not, that's not what people do, right? People find a way.\\nWeb 3 to the rescue.\\nInspired by the dangers of centralized impunity in the finance industry, i.e., the 2008 financial crisis, Web 3 technology was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto to specifically tackle this centralization issue. He leveraged a decentralized public ledger known as the blockchain to create a new internet of sorts, which is becoming rather mainstream.\\nWeb 3 infrastructure runs on a decentralized network of nodes, distributed around the world. This constitutes a network that will definitely overcome Dormammu’s bane if you ask me, i.e., there's no singular point of failure. Even if one node is compromised, others are still active and will keep the network up and running. Way to make lemonade.\\nWell, problem solved, right? Web 3 is the way; all web 2 companies should just adopt web 3 infrastructure so you can peacefully scroll through TikTok endlessly.\\nNo…\\nHow about the ginormously expensive infrastructure already in place for Web 2? You just pack them up somewhere and move on? Doesn't work like that. Aside from centralization, web 2 infrastructure also has some advantages that web 3 is yet to catch up with. An example is that the technology is rather more established, hence, easily more maintainable. So, how do you solve the centralization vulnerability without the great loss of web 2 infrastructure?\\nEnter the DePin Philosophy!\\nAs the name suggests, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) merges decentralized technology with physical infrastructure, creating new opportunities for efficiency, security, and global accessibility. DePIN, or Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, is a concept where blockchain technology is applied to manage and operate physical infrastructure. Unlike traditional infrastructure systems, controlled by governments or private entities, DePIN uses decentralized networks to distribute control among participants.\\nFor example, rather than a telecom provider owning a network of cell towers, a DePIN project could allow individual operators to host nodes that form a collective network. This approach enhances inclusivity and minimizes single points of failure. The magic of DePIN lies in its integration of blockchain’s decentralized nature with tangible infrastructure.\\nWelcome to the Aleph Supercloud.\\nAleph Supercloud is a Web3 network, providing infrastructure for decentralized storage, compute, and AI. Built on hundreds of globally distributed nodes, it powers scalable and resilient applications for Web3, DeFi, AI, and gaming industries. Developers rely on Aleph for high-performance resources across networks like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. Aleph also provides a blockchain indexing framework, allowing developers to index data from any blockchain network by leveraging the network's decentralized storage and compute capabilities.\\nAleph provides a robust infrastructure for DePIN, which we’ll explore further.\\nAleph Decentralized Infrastructure Network\\nAleph is an open-source off-chain P2P (peer-to-peer) network. It offers a decentralized key-value store, file storage, function execution, and virtual machine provisioning. Interactions with the network rely on decentralized identities that are interoperable with many major blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Tezos, and Solana.\\nThe Aleph.im project has the following components:\\n- The Aleph peer-to-peer network comprises Compute Resource Nodes or CRNs and Core Channel Nodes, or CCNs.\\n- Python and TypeScript SDKs to integrate Aleph.im's decentralized compute and storage solutions into your project.\\n- A Python command-line tool to interact with the Aleph.im network directly from a terminal\\n- A Web Console to create and manage cloud resources.\\n- A Node Operator Dashboard\\n- A Message Explorer\\nThe Aleph.im network is composed of 2 sets of nodes:\\n- CCNs, the backbone of the P2P network. They serve as an entry point into the network through an API (similar to a blockchain node's RPC).\\n- CRNs, responsible for the actual compute and storage available on Aleph.im. CRNs must be tied manually to a single CCN, and each CCN is incentivized to tie up to 3 CRNs.\\nCore Channel Nodes\\nAleph.im Core Channel Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of the aleph.im decentralized network, which provides a secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant platform for various types of data storage and messaging services. The core channel nodes are responsible for maintaining the integrity, security, and reliability of the network by processing and validating transactions, storing and sharing data, and ensuring consensus among the participating nodes.\\nThese nodes are crucial for the seamless operation of aleph.im as they enable various functionalities, such as cross-chain communication, data storage, and data indexing. They facilitate the exchange of information between different blockchain networks and allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the power of aleph.im.\\nThe core channel nodes are designed to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant, ensuring that the aleph.im network remains operational even in the face of adversarial conditions or network failures. They are governed by a set of protocols and consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior and discourage malicious actions.\\nMoreover, aleph.im core channel nodes are operated by a diverse set of participants, including individuals, organizations, and developers, which helps ensure the decentralization and security of the network. To become a compute resource node, participants need to stake ALEPH tokens, which serve as a form of collateral to ensure that the node operators remain honest and provide reliable services. Node operators are rewarded with ALEPH tokens for their contribution to the network, which further motivates them to maintain\\nHardware requirements\\n- Processor: Recent cpu with at least 4 cores\\n- Memory: 32 GB of RAM minimum (64 GB recommended)\\n- Storage: 4+ TB HDD or SSD (ideally with at least the system on an SSD)\\n- Connectivity: 100 MB upload bandwidth minimum (ideally 1 GB)\\nCompute Resource Nodes\\nAleph.im compute resource nodes (CRN) are decentralized computing infrastructure components that form a vital part of the aleph.im network. These nodes work collectively to provide distributed and secure computing power, storage, and other resources to users and applications on the platform.\\nCompute resource nodes are designed to support a wide range of tasks, including off-chain smart contract execution, decentralized application (dApp) hosting, and decentralized file storage. These nodes enable users to access and utilize decentralized computing resources without relying on centralized servers or cloud providers, ensuring better privacy, security, and control over their data and applications.\\nIn return for their contributions, node operators are rewarded with ALEPH tokens, creating an incentive system for maintaining a healthy and robust ecosystem.\\nThe aleph.im network relies on a peer-to-peer architecture, where compute resource nodes communicate with each other to share information and coordinate tasks. This architecture ensures that the network remains resilient against single points of failure, as the removal of one node does not impact the overall functioning of the system.\\nFurthermore, aleph.im employs advanced cryptographic techniques and consensus algorithms to ensure that the compute resource nodes\\nHardware requirements\\n- Platform: A bare metal server is required since virtual servers are often too slow and unable to run nested virtualization.\\n- Processor using x86_64 (alias amd64) architecture (2 options): Min. 8 cores / 16 threads, 3.0ghz+ CPU (gaming CPU for fast boot-up of microVMs) Min. 12 core / 24 threads, 2.4ghz+ CPU (datacenter CPU for multiple concurrent loads)\\n- Memory: Min. 64GB of RAM\\n- Storage: 1TB (NVME SSD preferred, datacenter fast HDD possible under conditions, you’ll want a big and fast cache)\\n- Connectivity: Minimum of 500 Mbit/s, both IPv4 and IPv6 configured\\nTools in the Aleph Infrastructure\\nAleph.im offers a wide range of tools and services to help you build decentralized applications. Whether you need decentralized storage, compute power, or web3 integration, Aleph.im has you covered. Let's explore the key features and potential use cases of Aleph.im's infrastructure.\\nCompute Power\\n- On-demand VMs/Serverless Functions: Deploy virtual machines and serverless functions for your applications.\\n- Permanent VPS: Secure permanent virtual servers for ongoing needs.\\n- Confidential Compute: Upcoming support for sensitive data processing using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).\\n- Custom Runtimes: Create custom runtimes for specific programming languages and environments.\\n- VRF Support: Use Verifiable Random Functions for secure randomness in decentralized applications.\\nStorage\\n- Decentralized Storage: Store data securely across a distributed network.\\n- IPFS Integration: Use InterPlanetary File System for robust, cryptographically verifiable data storage.\\nWeb3 Integration\\n- Blockchain Interoperability: Connect to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more.\\n- Reverse Oracle: Interact with Aleph.im network using smart contracts & oracles.\\n- Blockchain Indexing: Index data from any blockchain network using Aleph.im's decentralized storage and compute capabilities.\\n- Token Payments: Pay for resources using ALEPH tokens across various blockchains.\\n- Decentralized Identities: Use decentralized identities for secure interactions with the network.\\n- Wallet Support: Interact with Aleph.im using popular wallet applications like Metamask.\\nAleph Cloud Supported Chains\\nThe support of a chain consists of the functionalities below. The support of a chain may be partial when only some of these functionalities are supported.\\n-\\nMessage signature: Messages on the aleph.im network must be signed using a user's private key. Different chains may use public-key cryptography differently, resulting in different methods of verifying message signatures.\\n-\\nWallet support: Interacting with aleph.im in a browser and signing messages requires the use of a Wallet application. These applications are often specific to one or a few chains.\\n- Token availability: Allocating resources on the aleph.im network relies on a fungible onchain token. Exchanging that token on a blockchain requires that token to be available on that chain first.\\n- Balance support: The aleph.im network needs to be aware of user's tokens on each supported chain in order to allow users to allocate resources on the network. Some services are not available without balance support.\\n- Staking support: Users can help securing the aleph.im network by holding tokens and staking them on Core Channel Nodes they consider trustworthy. The aleph.im network interacts with blockchains to achieve this mechanism.\\n- PAYG support: Users can pay for network resources in real-time by streaming tokens for the duration of their usage. When they open a token stream, payments flow continuously as long as they use the resource. Once they close the stream, payments stop, and the resource becomes inaccessible. This approach ensures users only pay for what they actively use, offering a flexible and efficient payment method.\\nAleph DePin for Global Connectivity - Reaching Underserved Regions\\nWhile we've greatly dwelt on the security concerns of traditional centralized systems, another limitation of these systems we're yet to explore is scalability/reach. We are in the information age and the world is supposed to be a global village. However, the limitations of centralized web 2 infrastructure (e.g., huge cost of network masts and cabling) greatly hinders its potential for global connectivity.\\nFor example, certain remote areas of the world remain underserved by web 2 internet access.\\nExamples of such areas include;\\n- Harsh continental areas (Villages, deserts, and thick forests)\\n- Oceans\\n- North Pole and Antarctica\\nThis is another problem to be solved by the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN). Imagine adopting individually operated blockchain nodes in those underserved communities and integrating them with the general internet. It would be a great application of DePin.\\nAleph Supercloud infrastructure is more than capable of handling this connectivity problem in underserved communities.\\nAleph DePIN versus Centralized Infrastructure\\n- Security: Aleph and DePIN technology in general creates a more secure system by tackling the singular point of failure problem found in centralized infrastructure.\\n- Cost: DePIN technology (blockchain nodes) is cheaper to set up and maintain than centralized infrastructure (satellites, masts, cables, and servers).\\n- Scalability: DePIN infrastructure is easier to set up in any part of the world, and hence is more scalable than centralized infrastructure.\\nConclusion\\nWeb 2 infrastructure is limited by factors like security (single point of failure), cost, and scalability, prompting the development of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN).\\nAleph Supercloud features an exceptional DePIN you can't afford to miss.\"}\n",

His AI clone just spoke in court.\\nSocial card description: AI continues to trickle into courtrooms, from 'hallucinated' court cases to deepfaked videos.\\nPeople just can’t stop using generative AI tools in legal proceedings, despite repeated pushback from frustrated judges. While AI initially appeared in courtrooms through bogus “hallucinated” cases the trend has taken a turn—driven by increasingly sophisticated AI video and audio tools. In some instances, AI is even being used to seemingly bring victims back from the dead.\\nThis week, a crime victim’s family presented a brief video in an Arizona courtroom depicting an AI version of 37-year-old Chris Pelkey. Pelkey was shot and killed in 2021 in a road rage incident. Now, four years later, the AI-generated “clone” appeared to address his alleged killer in court. The video, first reported by local outlet ABC15, appears to be the first known example of a generative AI deepfake used in a victim impact statement.\\n“To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,” the AI replica of Pelkey says in the video. “In another life, we probably could have been friends.”\\nThe video shows the AI version of Pelkey—a burly, bearded Army veteran—wearing a green hoodie and gray baseball cap. Pelkey’s family reportedly created the video by training an AI model on various clips of Pelkey. An “old age” filter was then applied to simulate what Pelkey might look like today. In the end, the judge sentenced Horcasitas to 10.5 years in prison for manslaughter, a decision he said was at least partly influenced by the AI-generated impact statement.\\n“This is the best I can ever give you of what I would have looked like if I got the chance to grow old,” the Pelkey deepfake said. “Remember, getting old is a gift that not everybody has, so embrace it and stop worrying about those wrinkles.”\\nA New York man used an AI deepfake to help argue his case\\nThe AI-generated impact statement comes just a month after a defendant in New York State court, 74-year-old Jerome Dewald, used a deepfake video to assist in delivering his own legal defense. When Dewald appeared in court over a contract dispute with a former employer, he presented a video showing a man in a sweater and blue dress shirt speaking directly to the camera. The judge, confused by the video, asked Dewald if the person on screen was his attorney. In reality, it was an AI-generated deepfake.\\n“I generated that,” Dewald said according to The New York Times. “That is not a real person.”\\nThe judge wasn’t pleased and reprimanded Dewald for failing to disclose that he had used AI software to aid his defense. Speaking with the NYT after the hearing, Dewald claimed he hadn’t intended to mislead the court but used the AI tool as a way to more clearly articulate his defense. He said he initially planned to have the deepfake resemble himself but switched to the version shown in court after encountering technical difficulties.\\n“My intent was never to deceive but rather to present my arguments in the most efficient manner possible,” Dewald reportedly said in a letter to the judges.\\nRelated: [This AI chatbot will be playing attorney in a real US court]\\nAI models have ‘hallucinated’ fake legal cases\\nThe two cases represent the latest examples of generative AI seeping into courtrooms, a trend that began gaining traction several years ago following the surge of public interest in popular chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Lawyers across the country have reportedly used these large language models to help draft legal filings and collect information. That has led to some embarrassing instances where models have “hallucinated” entirely fabricated case names and facts that eventually make their way into legal proceedings.\\nIn 2023, two New York-based lawyers were sanctioned by a judge after they submitted a brief containing six fake case citations generated by ChatGPT. Michael Cohen, the former personal lawyer of President Donald Trump, reportedly sent fake AI-generated legal cases to his attorney that ended up in a motion submitted to federal judges. Another lawyer in Colorado was suspended after reportedly submitting AI-generated legal cases. OpenAI has even been sued by a Georgia radio host who claimed a ChatGPT response accused him of being involved in a real embezzlement case he had nothing to do with.\\nGet ready for more AI in courtrooms\\nThough courts have punished attorneys and defendants for using AI in ways that appear deceptive, the rules around whether it’s ever acceptable to use these tools remain murky. Just last week, a federal judicial panel voted 8–1 to seek public comment on a draft rule aimed at ensuring that AI-assisted evidence meets the same standards as evidence presented by human expert witnesses. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts also addressed the issue in his 2023 annual report, noting both the potential benefits and drawbacks of allowing more generative AI in the courtroom. On one hand, he observed, AI could make it easier for people with limited financial resources to defend themselves. At the same time, he warned that the technology risks “invading privacy interests and dehumanizing the law.”\\nOne thing seems certain: We haven’t seen the last of AI deepakes in courtrooms.\"}\n",

Scribe David D. Levine slams \\'use of planet-destroying plagiarism machines\\'\\nFans and writers of science fiction are not necessarily enthusiastic about artificial intelligence - especially when it\\'s used to vet panelists for a major sci-fi conference.\\nThe kerfuffle started on April 30, when Kathy Bond, the chair of this summer\\'s World Science Fiction Convention (WorldCon) in Seattle, USA, published a statement addressing the usage of AI software to review the qualifications of more than 1,300 potential panelists. Volunteers entered the applicants\\' names into a ChatGPT prompt directing the chatbot to gather background information about that person, as an alternative to potentially time-consuming search engine queries.\\n\"We understand that members of our community have very reasonable concerns and strong opinions about using LLMs,\" Bond wrote. \"Please be assured that no data other than a proposed panelist’s name has been put into the LLM script that was used.\"\\nThe statement continues, \"Let’s repeat that point: no data other than a proposed panelist’s name has been put into the LLM script. The sole purpose of using the LLM was to streamline the online search process used for program participant vetting, and rather than being accepted uncritically, the outputs were carefully analyzed by multiple members of our team for accuracy.\"\\nThe prompt used, as noted in a statement issued Tuesday, was the following:\\nUsing the list of names provided, please evaluate each person for scandals. Scandals include but are not limited to homophobia, transphobia, racism, harassment, sexual misconduct, sexism, fraud.Each person is typically an author, editor, performer, artist or similar in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and or related fandoms.\\nThe objective is to determine if an individual is unsuitable as a panelist for an event.\\nPlease evaluate each person based on their digital footprint, including social, articles, and blogs referencing them. Also include file770.com as a source.\\nProvide sources for any relevant data.\\nThe results were reviewed by a staff member because, as Bond acknowledged, \"generative AI can be unreliable\" – an issue that has been raised in lawsuits claiming defamation for AI generated falsehoods about people. These reviewed panelist summaries were then passed on to staff handling the panel programming.\\nBond said that no possible panellist was denied a place solely as a result of the LLM vetting process, and that using an LLM saved hundreds of hours of volunteer time while resulting in more accurate vetting.\\nThe tone-deaf justification triggered withering contempt and outrage from authors such as David D. Levine, who wrote:\\nThis is a TERRIBLE idea and you should really have asked a few authors before implementing this plan. The output of LLMs is based on the work of creators, including your invited guests, which was stolen without permission, acknowledgement, or payment, and the amount of power and water used is horrific. The collation of multiple search results could have been handled with a simple script, without the use of planet-destroying plagiarism machines or the introduction of errors that required fact checking.\\nI acknowledge and appreciate the use of fact checking and I will take you at your word that no one was rejected because of the use of LLMs. Nonetheless this is an extremely poor choice, with exceptionally bad optics, and will result in a LOT of bad press and hurt feelings, which could easily have been avoided.\\nAuthor Jason Sanford offered a similar take: \"[U]sing LLMs to vet panelists is a powerful slap in the face of the very artists and authors who attend Worldcon and have had their works pirated to train these generative AI systems. My own stories were pirated to train LLMs. The fact that an LLM was used to vet me really pisses me off. And you can see similar anger from many other genre people in the responses to Kathy Bond’s post, with more than 100 comments ranging from shock at what happened to panelists saying they didn’t give Worldcon permission to vet them like this.\"\\nFollowing the outcry, World Science Fiction Society division head Cassidy, Hugo administrator Nicholas Whyte, and Deputy Hugo administrator Esther MacCallum-Stewart stepped down from their roles at the conference.\\nOn Friday, Bond issued an apology.\\n\"First and foremost, as chair of the Seattle Worldcon, I sincerely apologize for the use of ChatGPT in our program vetting process,\" said Bond. \"Additionally, I regret releasing a statement that did not address the concerns of our community. My initial statement on the use of AI tools in program vetting was incomplete, flawed, and missed the most crucial points. I acknowledge my mistake and am truly sorry for the harm it caused.\"\\n- Feeling dumb? Let Google\\'s latest AI invention simplify that wordy writing for you\\n- FYI: Most AI spending driven by FOMO, not ROI, CEOs tell IBM, LOL\\n- IT pros are caught between an AI rock and an economic hard place\\n- Meta blames Trump tariffs for ballooning AI infra bills\\nWhile creative professionals have varying views on AI, and may use it for research, auto-correction or more substantive compositional assistance, many see it as a threat to their livelihoods, as a violation of copyright, and as \"an insult to life itself.\"\\nThe Authors Guild\\'s impact statement on AI acknowledges that it can be commercially useful to writers even as it poses problems in the book market. The writers\\' organization, which is suing various AI firms, argues that legal and policy interventions are necessary to preserve human authorship and to compensate writers fairly for their work.\\nIn a joint statement posted on Tuesday evening, Bond and program division head SunnyJim Morgan offered further details about the WorldCon vetting process and reassurances that panellist reviews would be re-done without AI.\\n“First, and most importantly, I want to apologize specifically for our use of ChatGPT in the final vetting of selected panelists as explained below,” Morgan wrote. “OpenAI, as a company, has produced its tool by stealing from artists and writers in a way that is certainly immoral, and maybe outright illegal. When it was called to my attention that the vetting team was using this tool, it seemed they had found a solution to a large problem. I should have re-directed them to a different process.”\\n“Using that tool was a mistake. I approved it, and I am sorry.”\\nCon organizers are now re-vetting all invited panellists without AI assistance. ®'}\n",

Image restoration test with Blank Noise-Only Images\\n7. CONCLUSIONS\\nWe have showcased astronomical image restoration from HST quality to JWST quality using the efficient Transformer model via transfer learning. The pretraining dataset was created by rendering GT galaxy images based on analytic profiles and generating corresponding LQ versions by reducing their resolution and introducing noise. The finetuning dataset was produced by sampling GT galaxy images from deep JWST images, which were then degraded to the LQ images in a similar fashion.\\nWith the test dataset, we find that the restored images show significantly enhanced correlations with the GT images than their original LQ versions, reducing the scatters of isophotal photometry, Sersic index, and halflight radius by factors of 4.4, 3.6, and 4.7, respectively, with Pearson correlation coefficients approaching unity. We also visually confirm that the restored images are superior in terms of resolution and noise level. When we applied our model to real low-exposure HST images, the restored images also show significantly improved correlations with their multi-exposure versions, although the absence of their real GT images limits our interpretations.\\nWe discuss a few limitations of our model. First, the performance degrades in high noise regimes, where the background rms approaches ∼10% of the object peak values. Second, highly correlated noise can be misinterpreted as astronomical features, leading to the manifestation of low-surface brightness features. Third, the restoration of point sources is less than optimal.\\nAlthough it is possible to further improve the model with larger training datasets and enhanced training strategies, we anticipate that our current Transformer-based deep learning model will prove useful for a number of scientific applications, including precision photometry, morphological analysis, and shear calibration.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThis work was supported by Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No.2021-0-02068, Artificial Intelligence Innovation Hub).

IMAGE RESTORATION TEST WITH BLANK NOISE-ONLY IMAGES\\nOne of the key requirements of our deep-learning-based restoration model is that the model should not generate any false object images by overinterpreting the noise when the image contains no real astronomical source. To test this, we created blank noise-only images by varying the random seed and the noise level. We used 10 different random seeds, and for each random seed, we generate 1000 images, where the mean and standard deviation of the noise were set to\\nmimic those of a randomly selected galaxy image from the JWST train dataset. The RS images created from these blank images were carefully inspected. No image was found to contain pseudo-sources.

One expert in religious studies weighs in.\\nPresident Donald Trump doesn’t seem to be taking the criticism over an artificial intelligence-generated image depicting him as the pope too seriously.\\nThe controversial image, which showed Trump dressed in papal regalia — a white cassock, a papal mitre on his head and a cross around his neck — was posted on the president’s account on his Truth Social platform on Friday. The image was also reshared on official social media accounts for the White House. Trump had joked to reporters days prior that he’d “like to be pope” following the death of Pope Francis.\\nPeople have been outraged by the image. Several Catholic leaders publicly condemned the depiction, calling it disrespectful and a mockery.\\n“This is deeply offensive to Catholics especially during this sacred time that we are still mourning the death of Pope Francis and praying for the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the election of our new Pope,” said Illinois Bishop John Paprocki in a statement on Facebook. “President Trump owes an apology to Catholics and all people of good will.”\\nThe official social media account for the New York State Catholic Conference, the public policy voice of the Catholic bishops of New York state, released a statement on X on Saturday, saying “there is nothing clever or funny” about the image.\\n“Do not mock us,” the statement read.\\nBut the president hasn’t seemed too bothered by the backlash. He insisted the AI-generated image was a “joke” when a reporter asked him about it during an event at the Oval Office on Monday, where he announced that the 2027 NFL draft will be held in Washington, D.C.\\nHe gave quite the offhand response to the criticism: “They can’t take a joke?”\\n“You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media? The Catholics loved it,” Trump continued before seeming to distance himself from the image.\\n“I had nothing to do with it, somebody made up a picture of me dressed like the pope, and they put it out on the internet,” he said. “That’s not me that did it. I have no idea where it came from. Maybe it was AI... I just saw it last evening.”\\n“Actually my wife thought it was cute,” he added, referencing first lady Melania Trump.\\nWhen the reporter pointed out that the photo was posted on official White House social media accounts, Trump shrugged it off, saying, “Somebody did it in fun, it’s fine. Have to have a little fun, don’t you?”\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on who posted the image to Trump’s Truth Social account.\\nAnd Trump isn’t the only person in his administration to have found humor in relation to the vacancy of the papacy. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was slammed online last week after he responded to Trump’s joke about becoming the next pope by writing on X: “I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope.”\\n“This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!” he quipped, adding: “The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides.”\\nVice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism, made a joke last week on X that Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s latest title could be pope.\\nPope Francis’ funeral service was held on April 26 in St. Peter’s Square. The conclave to elect the new pope is set to begin on Wednesday.\\nDaniel Speed Thompson, associate professor in religious studies at the University of Dayton College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that while he believes Trump’s response to criticism over the AI-generated image seemed typical for the president — to treat criticism directed at him as ‘trivial’ — it also spoke volumes.\\n“By saying that the AI image was a just a joke, he himself dismisses and trivializes the concerns of Catholics who found the image ill-timed and repugnant,” Thompson said. “It indicates to me, at the very least, that the president has no conception of ‘sacredness’ outside of how people regard him.”\\nJohn P. Wihbey, director of the AI-media strategies lab at Northeastern University in Boston, told Reuters on Monday that Trump is exploiting an “uncharted territory,” which is the “merging of social media and AI power, organized for political power and narrative dominance.”\\nHe added: “I suspect politicians around the world will begin to use generative AI and social together in newfound ways.”\\nIt’s unusual to joke about an upcoming conclave in this manner.\\n“I have lived through four papal elections, with the fifth one occurring this week. I’ve never seen this level of humor expressed by U.S. public officials about an upcoming conclave,” Thompson said, though he pointed out that “we live in a media world vastly different from even the time of the last papal election in 2013.”\\n“We also live in the Trump era, which relishes overturning norms of acceptable behavior by public officials,” he said.\\nThompson said that while, in general, humor about the papacy may not necessarily always be considered offensive, Trump’s AI-generated photo goes “beyond the pale of humor and into the realm of insult and humiliation.”\\nWe Won't Back Down\\nYour Support Fuels Our Mission\\nYour Support Fuels Our Mission\\nAlready contributed? Log in to hide these messages.\\n“That indeed is a concerning precedent for the future,” he said.\\nThompson said that he believes Catholics were offended by the image for two main reasons: Catholics around the world are still mourning the death of Pope Francis, and the image itself was “disturbing.”\\n“For them, picturing President Trump, the seeming antithesis of so many Christian values, as the pope, who ideally should represent faith, integrity, selflessness, and peace, was jarring,” he said.\"}\n",

Alas, the latest salvo in the US-China trade war will shave about $700 million off those anticipated Q2 revenues, which it now expects to come in at $7.4 billion give or take $300 million or so.\\n\"Sequentially, we expect the client and gaining segment revenue to increase by double digit percentage; embedded segment revenue to be flat-ish; and we expect datacenter segment revenue to decrease due to the exclusion of MI308 revenue,\" CFO Jean Hu told analysts on the call.\\nWhile less than ideal, Hu emphasized that at the midpoint of the forecast, Q2 revenue growth would still top 27 percent compared to the same time last year.\\nMost of the remaining $800 million in revenues lost to unrealized MI308 GPU sales in China are expected to come out in Q3 with \"very little in Q4,\" Su explained.\\nIn addition to the expected total loss of $1.5 billion in revenues this fiscal year, the x86 giant had already announced in an SEC filing that it would take a charge of up to $800 million for \"inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves\" - this most likely refers to stockpiled chips that it will not be able to sell. In its Q1 earnings statement [PDF] Tuesday, AMD reiterated this, saying it expected to take \"approximately $800 million in charges for inventory and related reserves due to the new export controls\" in Q2.\\nThe situation could be worse. AMD\\'s much-larger rival Nvidia recently revealed it\\'ll book a $5.5 billion charge on account of H20 GPUs it can no longer sell to its Chinese partners.\\nAMD preps next-gen Instinct accelerators for early arrival\\nAMD expects its prospects to improve significantly in the second half as the US corp begins shipping its next generation of AI accelerators designed to compete directly with Nvidia\\'s Blackwell generation of GPUs.\\nInitially expected late in 2025, AMD moved up the launch, presumably to get out ahead of Nvidia\\'s newly announced Blackwell Ultra accelerators. As we previously reported, the MI355X promises to deliver peak floating point performance roughly equivalent to that of Nvidia\\'s B200 while also delivering 50 percent more memory capacity at 288GB of HBM3e memory.\\nOracle, Su said, will be among the first cloud providers to deploy a \"multi-billion\" cluster of the accelerators alongside its 5th-gen Epyc datacenter processors, and Pollara 400 smartNICs.\\nThis higher capacity has allowed AMD to serve larger gen AI models like Meta\\'s Llama 3.1 405B and OpenAI\\'s GPT family of models using fewer resources than comparable Nvidia systems. However, Blackwell Ultra slated to ship later this year, Nvidia will close the gap with 288GB of memory and 50 percent higher dense 4-bit floating point performance.\\nSu also teased its upcoming MI400-based rack-scale systems, which Su suggested would \"deliver leadership performance in both inferencing and training,\" when they arrive in 2026. Up to this point, AMD has lacked a rack-scale architecture to compete with Nvidia\\'s GB200 and GB300 NVL-72 platforms.\\nWe expect to get more information on both the MI355X and MI400-series accelerators at AMD\\'s Advancing AI event next month.\\n- First Nvidia, now AMD: Trump trade turmoil threatens $800M in China chip sales\\n- Cerebras CEO actually finds common ground with Nvidia as startup notches IBM win\\n- Intel tweaks its 18A process with variants tailored to mass-market chips, big AI brains\\n- Anthropic calls for tougher GPU export controls as Nvidia\\'s CEO implores Trump to spread the AI love\\nQ1 Performance\\nAs for the company\\'s Q1 performance, AMD banked $709 million in profits – up significantly from the year-ago quarter\\'s $123 million – on revenues which grew 36 percent year-on-year to $7.4 billion. This growth, Su said, was once again driven by strong demand across its Epyc, Instinct, and Ryzon product lines.\\nDatacenter sales accounted for the lion\\'s share of AMD\\'s revenue gains during the quarter, with the division generating $3.7 billion, up 57 percent from a year ago, as the biz ramped production of its MI325X accelerators and 5th-gen Epyc CPUs during the quarter.\\nAccording to Su, AMD will begin production of the latter in the United States later this year at TSMC\\'s Arizona fab site.\\nAMD\\'s Client and Gaming segment revenues, meanwhile, jumped 28 percent to $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Of that, Ryzen processor and SoC sales accounted for the majority of that at $2.3 billion. Gaming revenues, on the other hand, slid a precipitous 30% from last year to $647 million on weak demand for custom SoCs used in Sony, Microsoft, and Valve game consoles.\\nFinally, the embedded compute segment, which includes FPGAs and adaptive-SoCs, pulled in $823 million during the quarter, down 3 percent from this time last year. ®'}\n",

Chinese AV firms are already expanding internationally. Aside from Abu Dhabi, WeRide is operating commercial services in Beijing and France, and testing in several other markets across China and Europe.

WEF and UN push new global policies to regulate speech under the guise of cybersecurity.\\nHow long until online misinformation and disinformation are considered cybercrimes? perspective\\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes a blog post calling for the creation of a global authority on cybercrime that would have extradition and enforcement powers over uncooperative nations.\\nLast week, the WEF published a blogpost entitled, “4 steps towards creating an international agency against cybercrime,” in which the authors argue for the creation of an “International Cybercrime Coordination Authority (ICCA)” to act as an intelligence sharing body between like-minded nations that also has to the power to “standardize cybercrime extradition laws” and to “impose collective penalties on nations” that refuse to cooperate.\\n“It is time to formalize these efforts through the creation of an International Cybercrime Coordination Authority (ICCA), a standing alliance of nations committed to coordinated enforcement, intelligence-sharing, legal harmonization and joint disruption of cybercriminal infrastructure”\\nWEF, “4 steps towards creating an international agency against cybercrime,” April 2025\\nWritten by Anna Sarnek from Amazon Web Services and Ross Haleliuk of Venture in Security, the article is part of the WEF’s Center for Cybersecurity wherein the authors argue that the establishment of an ICCA would go far beyond the intelligence sharing capabilities of groups like the Five Eyes, the UN, and NATO and into the realm of collective punishment and extradition powers over nations.\\n“While intelligence-sharing networks like Five Eyes and global institutions like the United Nations (UN) have historically played a role in international warfare, they are not sufficient to address the scale, complexity and speed of modern digital threats,” they write.\\nTo the unelected globalists, every problem is a global one, and every problem requires a global solution bathed in bureaucracy.\\n“The ICCA would push to standardize cybercrime extradition laws, simplify digital evidence-sharing procedures and impose collective penalties (financial or diplomatic) on nations that refuse to cooperate or actively harbor offenders”\\nWEF, “4 steps towards creating an international agency against cybercrime,” April 2025\\nUsing Russia as an exemplary boogeyman for providing a safe haven for cybercriminals, the WEF authors want the ICCA, once established, to “impose collective penalties” on the country for being uncooperative and actively harboring offenders.\\n“In order to stop safe havens like Russia, we need to standardize extradition laws for cybercriminals and strengthen Interpol-led cybercrime enforcement,” they write.\\nHowever, before setting up an international body that would operate like a hybrid International Cybercriminal Court, a Global Police Force, and a Five Eyes rolled into one, a definition of what cybercrime actually is will be needed.\\n“Building on top of the work by Partnership against Cybercrime (PAC), a globally recognized legal definition of cybercrime could include attacks on hospitals, emergency services, airports and public utilities, ransomware, digital extortion, financial fraud, phishing, and identity theft at scale, as well as operation of criminal infrastructure such as botnets and dark web marketplaces,” the authors write.\\nWhat the authors leave out is that the Partnership against Cybercrime Working Group, and the WEF in general for that matter, also considers online “disinformation” as a threat to democratic governments as detailed in an Insight Report from November, 2020.\\n“In addition to financial crimes, criminals use internet based infrastructure to uphold terrorism and drug trafficking, and spread disinformation to destabilize governments and democracies”\\nWEF, Partnership Against Cybercrime Insight Report, November 2020\\nCommenting on this point is investigative journalist, author, and contributing editor at Unlimited Hangout, who wrote “Ending Anonymity: Why the WEF’s Partnership Against Cybercrime Threatens the Future of Privacy” for The Last American Vagabond in July 2021:\\n“Notably, the WEF Partnership against Cybercrime employs a very broad definition of what constitutes a ‘cybercriminal’ as they apply this label readily to those who post or host content deemed to be ‘disinformation’ that represents a threat to ‘democratic’ governments. The WEF’s interest in criminalizing and censoring online content has been made evident by its recent creation of a new Global Coalition for Digital Safety to facilitate the increased regulation of online speech by both the public and private sectors.”\\n“Shoring up trust will be a key goal of cybersecurity efforts over the next decade. The online spread of mis- and disinformation are now core cybersecurity concerns” \\\\ “Cybersecurity will become less about protecting the confidentiality and availability of information and more about protecting its integrity and provenance”\\nWEF, Cybersecurity Futures 2030: New Foundations, December 2023\\nIf that wasn’t enough, the WEF declared that online misinformation and disinformation were “core cybersecurity concerns” in a report published on December 5, 2023 entitled “Cybersecurity Futures 2030: New Foundations.”\\nAccording to the report, “Stable governments that follow through on long-term technology and cybersecurity strategies can become trusted ‘brands,’ gaining advantages in attracting talent, seizing leadership opportunities in multilateral standards-setting processes and countering disinformation campaigns.”\\nFast forward a few years, and the desire to stamp out all narratives that don’t align with unelected globalists at the UN and WEF has only intensified.\\nFor the second year in a row, the WEF has declared that the greatest global risk is misinformation and disinformation.\\nAccording to the WEF Global Risks 2025 report:\\nPolarization “continues to fan the flames of misinformation and disinformation, which, for the second year running, is the top-ranked short- to medium-term concern across all risk categories.\\n“Efforts to combat this risk are coming up against a formidable opponent in Generative AI-created false or misleading content that can be produced and distributed at scale,” which was the same assessment given in the 2024 report.\\n“The Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change responds to the commitment in the Global Digital Compact, adopted by United Nations Members States at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, which encourages UN entities, in collaboration with Governments and relevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals”\\nG20 Leaders Summit, November 2024\\nLast year, the G20 launched the “Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change” as an attempt “to address disinformation campaigns that are delaying and derailing climate action.”\\nIn the name of “information integrity” any narrative that could impede upon the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to be stamped out.\\nAccording to the G20 Leaders Summit 2024, “The Initiative responds to the commitment in the Global Digital Compact, adopted by United Nations Members States at the Summit of the Future in September 2024, which encourages UN entities, in collaboration with Governments and relevant stakeholders, to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.”\\nAt the time UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres remarked that member states must work together to crush climate disinformation.\\n“We must fight the coordinated disinformation campaigns impeding global progress on climate change, ranging from outright denial to greenwashing to harassment of climate scientists. Through this Initiative, we will work with researchers and partners to strengthen action against climate disinformation”\\nAntonio Guterres, G20 Leaders Summit, November 2024\\nIn 2023, the UN established a “voluntary UN Code of Conduct for Information Integrity on Digital Platforms” replete with policies aimed at silencing dissenting voices on digital platforms under the guise of mitigating “mis- and disinformation,” which is conveniently lumped-in with hate speech.\\nTo give you an idea of the sheer size and scope to which the UN wishes to eradicate anything it deems “mis- and disinformation,” here are a few policy recommendations taken from the “Towards a United Nations Code of Conduct” section of the policy brief that calls-on not just member states, but private groups such as stakeholders (i.e. NGOs, businesses, academia, etc.), digital platforms, advertisers, and news media to do the UN’s bidding:\\n- All stakeholders should refrain from using, supporting or amplifying disinformation and hate speech for any purpose.\\n- All stakeholders should allocate resources to address and report on the origins, spread and impact of mis- and disinformation and hate speech, while respecting human rights norms and standards and further invest in fact-checking capabilities across countries and contexts.\\n- All stakeholders should promote training and capacity-building to develop understanding of how mis- and disinformation and hate speech manifest and to strengthen prevention and mitigation strategies.\\n- All stakeholders should take urgent and immediate measures to ensure the safe, secure, responsible, ethical and human rights-compliant use of artificial intelligence and address the implications of recent advances in this field for the spread of mis- and disinformation and hate speech.\\n- Member States should ensure public access to accurate, transparent, and credibly sourced government information, particularly information that serves the public interest, including all aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals.\\n- Member States should invest in and support independent research on the prevalence and impact of mis- and disinformation and hate speech across countries and languages, particularly in underserved contexts and in languages other than English, allowing civil society and academia to operate freely and safely.\\n- Digital platforms and advertisers should ensure that advertisements are not placed next to online mis- or disinformation or hate speech, and that advertising containing disinformation is not promoted.\\n- Digital platforms should ensure meaningful transparency regarding algorithms, data, content moderation and advertising.\\n- Digital platforms should publish and publicize accessible policies on mis- and disinformation and hate speech, and report on the prevalence of coordinated disinformation on their services and the efficacy of policies to counter such operations.\\n- Digital platforms should ensure the full participation of civil society in efforts to address mis- and disinformation and hate speech.\\n- News media should ensure that all paid advertising and advertorial content is clearly marked as such and is free of mis- and disinformation and hate speech.\\nIn its own words, the UN is primarily concerned with what it deems to be “misinformation” because the unelected globalist body is worried about information that may affect “UN mandate delivery and substantive priorities,” especially when it comes to criticism of its Sustainable Development Goals.\\nTo bring it all back home, the WEF is promoting the creation of an International Cybercrime Coordination Authority, but how long will it be until online misinformation and disinformation are considered cybercrimes?\\nDon’t agree with climate change narratives?

The language used is GLSL 1.0, extended array access (foo(index)\\n, usable anywhere on the source), setters (foo(index) := value\\n, usable on the end only), and int i\\n, a global variable with the index of the monkey.\\nMore elaborate algorithms can be developed with GLSL.\\n-\\nVector multiplication:\\nmonkeys.set(\"a\", [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]); monkeys.set(\"b\", [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]); monkeys.set(\"c\", 16); // use a number to just alloc an array monkeys.work(16, \"c(i) := a(i) * b(i);\"); console.log(monkeys.get(\"c\"));\\n-\\nCrypto-currency mining:\\nmonkeys.set(\"blockhash\", [blockhash]); monkeys.set(\"monkeyNonce\", monkeyNonce); monkeys.set(\"result\", [0]); monkeys.work(totalMonkeys, ` const float attempts = ${attemptsPerMonkey.toFixed(1)}; float bhash = blockhash(0); float startNonce = monkeyNonce(i); float mined = 0.0; for (float nonce = startNonce; nonce < startNonce+attempts; ++nonce){ // Yes, this hash function is stupid float hash = mod(bhash * (nonce+1.0), pow(2.0,31.0) - 1.0); if (hash >= 0.0 && hash <= 3000.0) mined = nonce; }; result(mined > 0.0 ? 0 : 1) := mined; `); // Will be set if mined a block console.log(monkeys.get(\"result\"));\\nYou can also define libs, write to many indices in a single call, and work with raw Uint32 buffers if you wish to. For more details, please check the examples\\ndirectory.\\nThe only reliable way to access the GPU on the browser is by using WebGL. Since it wasn\\'t designed for general programming, doing it is very tricky. For one, the only way to upload data is as 2D textures of pixels. Even worse, your shaders (programs) can\\'t write directly to them; you need to, instead, render the result using geometrical primitives. You\\'re, thus, in charge of converting JS numbers (IEEE 754 floats) to pixels, projecting them to/from 2D textures and using proper geometries to render the results on the right places. You must also deal with aliasing/blurring, rounding, and loss of precision. It is a very delicate job with many small details that could go wrong and no satisfactory way of debugging. WebMonkeys takes care of all that for you, abstracting the overcomplication away and making the power of the GPU as easily accessible as possible, with a very simple API based on array reads and writes.\\n-\\nA single monkey can write to multiple places. If you need to fill an array of 100 numbers, you could use 100 monkeys writing to 1 index each, or 10 monkeys writing to 10 indices each. What is faster will depend on your application.\\n-\\nWhile CPU/GPU bandwidth is huge these days, it still takes time to communicate data between them. Whenever possible, reduce your calls to\\nset/get\\n, and keep things internal to the GPU. For example, if you need to move data between two arrays, this:monkeys.work(16, \"target(i) := source(i);\")\\n- is much faster than this:monkeys.set(\"target\", monkeys.get(\"source\"))\\n. -\\nThe first call to\\nmonkeys.work(count, someTask)\\nis slow due to program compilation, but every call after that is fast. That is for two reasons: 1. WebMonkeys caches shaders so that, when you calltask\\nwith a repeated source code, it just recovers the previously compiled program; 2. JS engines keep strings hashed, which means that retrieval can be done in O(1). In other words, it is perfectly reasonable to callmonkeys.work(n, bigSourceCode)\\ninside your animation loop (as long asbigSourceCode\\ndoesn\\'t change). -\\nSince WebMonkeys stores numbers as WebGL textures, writing/reading to/from arrays has an encode/decode overhead. If your application spends much more time doing arithmetics than writing/reading data, that is acceptable. If not, use raw buffers and do your own packing/unpacking.\\n-\\nRemember you can\\'t have setters (\\nfoo(i) := v;\\n) in the middle of your program. They must be at the end.

The company’s Intelligent Data Infrastructure supports many of the world’s largest cloud platforms and is designed to meet the performance demands of today’s artificial intelligence-driven environments.\\n“We see NetApp aiming to redefine what’s possible at the intersection of AI, data and cloud by delivering a unified, intelligent infrastructure that simplifies complexity and secures data everywhere it lives,” Strechay said. “We expect more announcements covering the innovation that brings AI to the data, not the other way around — unlocking faster decisions, better outcomes and seamless operations across hybrid and multicloud environments.”\\nThat vision will take center stage during NetApp’s “Architecting Outcomes in the Era of Intelligence” event on May 13. TheCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio, will welcome data platform specialists, cybersecurity architects and cloud strategists to examine how intelligent infrastructure is evolving to support enterprise AI readiness amid growing complexity and risk. With AI model complexity surging and threat vectors expanding, the event is set to explore technical strategies for scalable performance, built-in cyber resilience and next-generation data management. (* Disclosure below.)\\nData-layer defense and enterprise AI readiness: A new blueprint for trust\\nThe rising tide of AI-enhanced cyberattacks prompts enterprise security leaders to rethink where and how they harden defenses. NetApp is responding with new capabilities that embed protection directly into the storage layer, where data resides and breaches can be the most devastating. The company’s expanded BlueXP platform adds ransomware-specific role-based access controls and extends protection to native cloud workloads. NetApp has introduced backup and recovery enhancements for Microsoft SQL Server, VMware and Kubernetes environments, alongside post-quantum cryptography for file and block storage.\\n“Backup and recovery is an important part of security at the storage layer, but NetApp’s comprehensive security capabilities expand the role of primary storage with built-in automated ransomware detection and response that enable customers to take a proactive approach to keep their data secure,” Gagan Gulati, senior vice president and general manager of data services at NetApp, said in a recent release. “With built-in security capabilities that secure our customers’ data on any workload, anywhere, NetApp has made storage as critical to a sound cybersecurity strategy as perimeter and endpoint security tools.”\\nThese developments lay the foundation for enterprise AI readiness by prioritizing resilience, scalability and data-layer trust. As enterprises expand AI across their environments, NetApp’s investments in storage-layer defense signal a broader commitment to building confidence in data-driven systems. That balance between protection and progress is expected to shape key discussions at the event.\\nNetApp is reinforcing a message it has carried all along: The real challenge lies in aligning infrastructure and data. Chief Executive Officer George Kurian continues to emphasize the need to simplify data management so AI efforts can move beyond experimentation and deliver business impact. That focus on unifying infrastructure and intelligence is expected to underscore some of the technical discussions unfolding during the event.\\n“AI has been implemented as a silo from an infrastructure, data and process perspective, which is why so many of the AI projects never make it to production,” Kurian told theCUBE during a recent interview. “The algorithms are only as good as the data that you feed them, so it’s super important that you have a really good data strategy and a data management approach that helps the algorithms understand your business better so that you can use [them] to drive business advantage.”\\nKurian advocates for an inclusive model of AI innovation that depends on data access and shared data and platform standards. That perspective continues to shape how NetApp approaches solution development and partnership strategy, and Kurian doesn’t mince words about the need for broader inclusion.\\n“We believe that for AI to have the transformative impact that people talk about today, it can’t just be the largest organizations, but it has to be every organization, whether it’s educational institutions — whether it’s governments, whether it’s underdeveloped countries, all of them have to be able to access,” Kurian said.\\nTheCUBE event livestream\\nDon’t miss theCUBE’s coverage of NetApp’s “Architecting Outcomes in the Era of Intelligence” event on May 13.

In today’s landscape, the ability to recover quickly from an attack hinges on how effectively AI can be deployed to protect and verify core data assets.\\nSo what does cyber resiliency actually look like when AI is at the heart of it? Are organizations seeing real-world benefits, or just more complexity?\\n“AI is the force multiplier, and it’s the force multiplier for the good or bad actors in terms of what’s happening there,” said Brian Householder (pictured, left), senior advisor at Index Engines Inc. “The attack surface, the attack vectors, all of those things are really becoming much, much greater, and so I think that’s the challenge that most of them have. I even see it when it comes to AI deployments for enterprises.”\\nHouseholder and Jim McGann (right), chief marketing officer of Index Engines, spoke with analyst Christophe Bertrand during an exclusive conversation on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed how AI is reshaping cyber resiliency, even as attackers weaponize it to develop new attack vectors and entry points. (* Disclosure below.)\\nAI as a defensive strategy in modern cyber resiliency\\nAI has become essential in protecting digital infrastructure. At Index Engines, AI is embedded into its CyberSense platform to detect anomalies, verify data integrity and support faster, more confident recovery. Without it, organizations face enormous challenges in identifying clean copies of data post-attack, according to McGann.\\n“Part of cyber resiliency is about trust in data, trust that you have good data, because that’s what keeps a business going — whether it’s an Epic or healthcare database with records in it, or whether it’s running your financial systems,” he said. “That’s the most important point: You can try to keep them out, but making sure you have a clean copy data is critical.”\\nAI is especially crucial for identifying subtle signs of data corruption. Legacy recovery methods often assume backups are trustworthy, but modern attacks frequently target backups first. This makes AI-based scanning and validation a linchpin in any resiliency strategy.\\n“Now you have to make sure [the gold data copy] hasn’t been corrupted and it hasn’t been ransomware or encrypted or partially encrypted or all these different attack vectors that now occur,” Householder said. “I think that’s the critical one where AI … it sounds like where people are starting to realize, ‘OK, that gold copy, I’m not sure if it’s a gold copy after all.'”\\nCyberSense’s approach to AI is proactive and research-driven. Index Engine’s lab detonates thousands of ransomware variants in isolated environments to study behavioral patterns. This enables the AI engine to differentiate between normal user activity and malicious manipulation of files or databases.\\n“We see 800 to thousands of new variants every day,” McGann said. “They’re just iterations. Now with ransomware as a service and AI, that’s turned up significantly. We went into an AI engine and described what a ransomware needs to do. It kicked out the code to that, and it was pretty good. We’re seeing hundreds, if not thousands, of variants a day. We have an isolated network; we detonate the malware, and we study the behavior.”\\nIndex Engines delivers CyberSense through strategic partnerships with leading storage and data protection vendors, such as Dell Technologies Inc. These alliances ensure that AI-powered data integrity checks are integrated into both primary and secondary storage environments, according to McGann.\\n“Dell has a Cyber Recovery isolated vault that’s been very successful,” he said. “We have thousands of deployments globally, including some of the largest organizations out there. We also have partnerships with IBM with their safeguarded flash storage environment in production, so snapshots of data are being scanned. We have partnerships with Infinidat as well. Again, snapshots with their InfiniSafe product.”\\nHere’s theCUBE’s complete interview with Jim McGann and Brian Householder:\\n(* Disclosure: Index Engines Inc. sponsored this segment of theCUBE.

      "async_langchain: 132, {'article': \"Page title: Zed: The Fastest AI Code Editor — Zed's Blog\\nSocial card title: Zed: The Fastest AI Code Editor - Zed Blog\\nSocial card description: From the Zed Blog: Zed is now the world's fastest AI code editor.\\nFor millions of years, humans have used tools to create things. We programmers have recently created some very useful tools for ourselves: large language models. So far, these futuristic tools have been accessible to programmers in one of three ways:\\n- Copy/pasting from a website\\n- Running in a terminal emulator\\n- Baked into a closed-source fork of an open-source fork of a web browser\\nAs of today, there is now a fourth option:\\nZed, the world’s fastest AI code editor.\\nBuilt in Rust, Open Source (GPL)\\nThe entire Zed code editor is open source under GPL version 3, and scratch-built in Rust all the way down to handcrafted GPU shaders and OS graphics API calls. Zed's new AI capabilities are also open-source, just like the rest of the editor, so you can see exactly what the new Agent Panel is doing under the hood.\\nHere it is in action:\\nThe Agent Panel lets you tell an AI agent what to do, and it'll do as you asked to the best of its ability. This can be anything from asking questions about your code base to having it directly make changes and write new code.\\nFor example, here I opened the Agent Panel and asked the agent to make a change about a blog post format:\\nI just typed in the words and pressed Enter; I didn’t have to teach the agent anything about my code base first, or wait for an indexing process to finish. The agent quickly figured out what it needed by searching the code base—the same thing I’d do if I found myself in a new code base and wanted to orient myself.\\nThis example had the agent making a trivial edit, but agents can be helpful even when I want to handcraft code myself. For example, in an unfamiliar part of a large code base, an agent can save me time by tracking down the spot where I need to make the change.\\nPrivacy and Security by Default\\nYour conversation with the agent is private by default; Zed doesn't harvest your data for training purposes (or any other purpose). If you want to share feedback to help improve Zed's AI, we've made it easy to do that by pressing a thumbs-up/thumbs-down button... but unless you opt into it by pressing the button, your conversation is never saved on our servers.\\nThe agent will also prompt you for confirmation before doing things that potentially couldn't be undone, like running terminal commands. (You can also tell it to always confirm, if you aren’t worried about what it might run.)\\nSecurity prompts aside, generally the agent is designed to run in the background without bothering you, so you can do other things while it works. When the agent is done, you get a notification if you had Zed in the background (including if you had a second Zed window open so you could work on another git checkout while the agent does its thing).\\nOnce it’s done, you can review everything it did in one unified diff.\\nThe diff is fully editable, so you can easily make changes to whatever the model came up with. It supports multicursor editing, language server integrations, and all the speed you love from the rest of Zed.\\nCustom Models, Custom Tools\\nA dropdown lets you choose which language model powers the agent. In addition to our selection of popular models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5—available either through your Zed account or by bringing your own API key—you can also run custom models on your own hardware via Ollama.\\nEach agent can access the full capabilities of the editor. That means not only can it edit the filesystem, it can also run language servers, linters, formatters, and even terminal commands in your local shell (with your permission). Every extension you install can give the agent new powers.\\nYou can also customize which powers an agent may use on a given task. Revoking an agent’s access to a tool is as simple as unchecking that tool from a list, and you can save those preferences to Profiles for quickly switching between tool configurations later. Zed ships with three convenient built-in Profiles: Write (all tools enabled), Ask (just the readonly tools), and Minimal (no tools at all, for when you just want to chat with the model).\\nYou can extend the agent’s capabilities with new tools, via Zed’s support for the Model Context Protocol. This can give the agent access to things like databases, analytics, creating pull requests, and browser automation.\\nAs an example of how MCP tools can be tailored to your specific use-case, check out this demo that Elixir creator José Valim made of a MCP tool that works directly with the popular Phoenix Web Framework.\\nWhat does it cost?\\nIt costs nothing to use Zed without the AI features. As always, you can download Zed (or build it from source) and use it as a non-AI editor without signing up for anything. All the non-AI features will work as normal. This is how it’s always been, and we don’t plan to change that!\\nYou can also pay someone else to use Zed’s AI features. That is, you can bring your own API keys and they will Just Work with the new Agent Panel. As with Zed’s other AI features, you can also use Ollama to run Zed’s agents on your own hardware. (The only AI feature that doesn’t support this yet is Edit Predictions; custom models are on the roadmap but haven’t landed yet.)\\nWe’re also giving away some amount of AI usage. On our free plan you'll get 50 prompts per month and on our new Pro plan you'll get 500 prompts for $20/month. Check out our Pricing page for more details.\\nWe’re offering these plans because monthly limits are a popular alternative pricing structure to usage-based APIs—but if you’d prefer to bring your own API keys and pay (someone else) per token, you absolutely can. It doesn’t cost us anything when you do that, so we don’t charge anything for it either!\\nOur goal at Zed has always been to make the world’s best code editor. We built the Agent Panel because we believe the world’s best code editor should give its users easy access to helpful AI agents, not because we’re trying to make money by charging a premium on top of third-party AI services.\\nLong-term, we aim to build a self-sustaining business where revenue comes mostly from optional paid features that make an already-great experience even better.\\nTry it out!\\nYou can try out Zed’s new Agentic Editing experience right now—just download Zed here. That’s the easiest way to see what you think of it!\\nRight now, Zed only has a stable release for macOS and Linux. Windows users can build from source, but the reason we don’t have a stable release for Windows is that it’s not finished yet. (Scratch-building an editor means scratch-building support for each OS individually!) We plan to have a stable release of Windows later in 2025, and you can sign up for the beta right now.\\nAs exciting as this launch is, we’re just getting warmed up. Stay tuned for:\\n- A major debugger release later this month\\n- Improved collaboration between programmers and AI agents\\n- Windows!\"}\n"
