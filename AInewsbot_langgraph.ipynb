    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n"

      "Social card title: Unlocking the soundscape of coral reefs with artificial intelligence: pretrained networks and unsupervised learning win out\n",
      "Social card description: Author summary Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise bioacoustic monitoring of coral reefs. So far, only a limited set of work has used machine learning to train detectors for specific sounds such as individual fish species. However, building detectors is a time-consuming process that involves manually annotating large amounts of audio, followed by complicated model training. This process must then be repeated for any new dataset. Instead, we explore machine learning techniques for whole soundscape analysis, comparing the acoustic properties of raw recordings from the entire habitat. We identify multiple machine learning methods for whole soundscape analysis and rigorously test these using datasets from Indonesia, Australia and French Polynesia. Our findings reveal that use of a neural network pretrained on 5.2 million hours of unrelated YouTube audio offers a powerful tool to produce compressed representations of reef audio data, conserving the data’s key properties whilst being executable on a standard personal laptop. These representations can then be used to explore patterns in reef soundscapes using unsupervised machine learning, which is effective at grouping similar recordings together. We show these groupings hold relationships with ground truth ecological data, including coral cover, the fish community and depth.\n",
