    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- rate stories for impact, credibility, novelty, using an ELO competition\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "- use new stateful OpenAI API, make some persistent assistants instead of complex prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

      "Social card title: Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data\n",
      "Social card description: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples.

      "Social card title: Scoring the European Citizen in the AI Era\n",
      "Social card description: Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness, monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks, and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory. Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based scoring.\n",

Read about AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Amazon, and more.\\n- Nvidia dominates the AI semiconductor market.\\n- Nvidia\\'s dominance stems from early investment in GPUs for AI, starting with CUDA software.\\n- AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and startups challenge Nvidia with new AI chip designs and strategies.\\nNvidia is undoubtably dominant in the AI semiconductor space. Estimates fluctuate, but the company has more than 80% market share by some estimates when it comes to the chips that reside inside data centers and make products like ChatGPT and Claude possible.\\nThat enviable dominance goes back almost two decades, when researchers began to realize that the same kind of intensive computing that made complex, visually stunning video games and graphics possible, could enable other types of computing too.\\nThe company started building its famous software stack, named Compute Unified Device Architecture or CUDA, 16 years before the launch of ChatGPT. For much of that time, it lost money. But CEO Jensen Huang and a team of true believers saw the potential for graphics processing units to enable artificial intelligence. And today, Nvidia and its products are responsible for most of the artificial intelligence at work in the world.\\nThanks to the prescience of Nvidia\\'s leadership, the company had a big head start when it came to AI computing, but challengers are running fast to catch up. Some were competitors in the gaming or traditional semiconductor spaces, and others have started up from scratch.\\nAMD\\nAMD is Nvidia\\'s top competitor in the market for AI computing in the data center. Helmed by its formidable CEO Lisa Su, AMD launched its own GPU, called the MI300, for the data center in 2024, more than a full year after Nvidia\\'s second generation of data center GPUs started shipping.\\nThough experts and analysts have touted the chip\\'s specifications and potential based on its design and architecture, the company\\'s software is still somewhat behind that of Nvidia, making these chips somewhat harder to program and use to their full potential.\\nAnalysts predict that the company has under 15% market share. But AMD executives insist that they are committed to bringing its software up to par and that future expectations for the evolution of the accelerated computing market will benefit the company — specifically, the spread of AI into so-called edge devices like phones and laptops.\\nQualcomm, Broadcom, and custom chips\\nAlso challenging Nvidia are application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. These custom-designed chips are less versatile than GPUs, but they can be designed for specific AI computing workloads at a much lower cost, which have made them a popular option for hyperscalers.\\nThough multipurpose chips like Nvidia\\'s and AMD\\'s graphics processing units are likely to maintain the largest share of the AI-chip market in the long term, custom chips are growing fast. Morgan Stanley analysts expected the market for ASICs to double in size in 2025.\\nCompanies that specialize in ASICs include Broadcom and Marvell, along with the Asia-based players Alchip Technologies and MediaTek.\\nMarvell is in part responsible for Amazon\\'s Trainium chips while Broadcom builds Google\\'s tensor processing units, among others. OpenAI, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and TikTok parent company ByteDance have all entered the race for a competitive ASIC as well.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nAmazon and Google\\nWhile also being prominent customers of Nvidia, the major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, often called hyperscalers, have also made efforts to design their own chips, often with the help of semiconductor companies.\\nAmazon\\'s Trainium chips and Google\\'s TPUs are the most scaled of these efforts and offer a cheaper alternative to Nvidia chips, mostly for the companies\\' internal AI workloads. However, the companies have shown some progress in getting customers and partners to use their chips as well. Anthropic has committed to running some workloads on Amazon\\'s chips, and Apple has done the same with Google\\'s.\\nIntel\\nOnce the great American name in chip-making, Intel has fallen far behind its competitors in the age of AI. But, the firm does have a line of AI chips called Gaudi that some reports have said can stand up to Nvidia\\'s in some respects.\\nIntel installed a new CEO, semiconductor veteran Lip-Bu Tan, in the first quarter of 2025 and one of his first actions was to flatten the organization so that the AI chip operations reports directly to him.\\nHuawei\\nThough Nvidia\\'s American hopeful challengers are many, China\\'s Huawei is perhaps the most concerning competitor of all for Nvidia and all those concerned with continued US supremacy in AI.\\nHuang himself has called Huawei the \"single most formidable\" tech company in China. Reports that Huawei\\'s AI chip innovation is catching up are increasing in frequency. New restrictions from the Biden and Trump administrations on shipping even lower-power GPUs to China have further incentivized the company to catch up and serve the Chinese markets for AI. Analysts say further restrictions being considered by the Trump administration are now unlikely to hamper China\\'s AI progress.\\nStartups\\nAlso challenging Nvidia are a host of startups offering new chip designs and business models to the AI computing market.\\nThese firms are starting out at a disadvantage, as they don\\'t have the full-sized sales and distribution machines decades of chip sales in other types of tech bring. But several are holding their own by finding use cases, customers, and distribution methods that are attractive to customers based on faster processing speeds or lower cost. These new AI players include Cerebras, Etched, Groq, Positron AI, Sambanova Systems, and Tenstorrent, among others.'}\n",

As the digital…\\nAI-powered sex chat platforms are rapidly gaining attention, ranking among today’s most talked about technology trends. As the digital landscape evolves, more people are turning to ai sex chat for intimacy, privacy, and self-discovery. Driven by a combination of curiosity, changing social norms, and the desire for safe exploration, these platforms present a unique opportunity to connect intimately without concern for judgment or stigma. Below, we’ll explore key statistics and uncover the top benefits of using AI sex chat, illustrating why so many are adopting this innovative approach to personal connection.\\nThe Rise of AI Sex Chat in Numbers\\nRecent data highlights a significant upward trend in the use of artificial intelligence for intimate conversations:\\n- A 2023 survey showed that over 40% of users seeking online intimacy have explored AI-powered sex chat at least once in the last year.\\n- Monthly searches for “AI sex chat” grew by over 150% in the past 18 months, according to aggregated search engine reports.\\n- 67% of users report feeling less anxious and more willing to discuss sexual desires and concerns with an AI partner, compared to speaking with a human.\\n- Nearly 80% of respondents stated that privacy and anonymity were top motivators for choosing AI over real-person interactions for intimate conversations.\\n- Among users aged 18-29, the adoption rate of AI intimacy platforms is twice as high as users over 40, showcasing its appeal among digitally native generations.\\nThese numbers point to a surge in interest, driven by the desire for safe, stigma-free spaces to explore and understand personal needs.\\nUncovering the Core Benefits of AI Sex Chat\\nA Judgment-Free Environment\\nMany individuals hesitate to discuss intimate topics with friends, partners, or therapists due to fear of being judged. AI sex chat breaks down this barrier by offering a completely judgment-free zone. The AI interacts without preconceived notions, cultural biases, or personal opinions, making it easier for users to open up about fantasies, insecurities, or questions.\\nStatistics underscore this advantage:\\n- About 72% of AI sex chat users agree that they feel more comfortable sharing personal details, knowing they are conversing with a non-judgmental AI.\\n- Over half of users recognize reduced feelings of shame and guilt when disclosing sensitive matters to AI, compared with traditional conversation partners.\\nPrivacy and Anonymity\\nMaintaining privacy is a key concern when exploring intimate topics. AI chat platforms prioritize user confidentiality, offering discreet environments protected by cyber-security measures. Users can express themselves freely, without fear of social consequences or revelations outside the digital space.\\n- 86% of surveyed participants said that knowing their information wouldn’t be disclosed contributed significantly to their willingness to use AI sex chat platforms.\\n- Many users rely on secure logins, encrypted messaging, and customizable identities, further safeguarding anonymity.\\nImmediate, Non-Stop Engagement\\nOne of the prized advantages of AI is its availability. Users can access these platforms at any hour, receiving immediate responses. There are no limitations based on time zones, personal schedules, or AI fatigue. This offers a distinct advantage over traditional connections, where finding someone to talk with can be challenging.\\n- A majority (81%) of users cite 24/7 availability as an important benefit for spontaneous connection or whenever the need arises.\\n- The average time spent per session is 22 minutes, reflecting how users value in-depth engagement without interruption.'}\n",

Happy Mother\\'s Day to anyone celebrating today. I\\'m Alistair Barr. I\\'m subbing in this week to get some practice ahead of Tech Memo, a BI newsletter launching very soon. It\\'s a weekly inside look at Big Tech — what you need to know, what it\\'s like to work in Silicon Valley, and how to get ahead. I\\'m paying for two kids in college right now, so do me a solid and sign up here!\\nOn the agenda today:\\n- The ugly truth about America\\'s homebuying outlook.\\n- Tesla\\'s robotaxi will compete with Waymo in Austin. Here\\'s how the two companies compare.\\n- Rich Americans are keeping the country from sliding into a recession.\\n- Berkshire Hathaway shareholders told BI what they thought of a future without Warren Buffett.\\nBut first: Working in Big Tech is changing radically.\\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider\\'s app here.\\nThis week\\'s dispatch\\nWanted: Fewer, better employees doing more with less\\nFor decades, Silicon Valley has suffered from a shortage of technical talent. This place is a software-production engine, and smart, young, hungry engineers have been its main fuel source. They work night and day, churning out code for websites, apps, search engines, social networks, and more.\\nThe companies that won recruited and retained the best talent. The result was a race to lavish employees with juicy salaries and huge stock awards. Perks were plenty: free massages, laundry service, and delicious food served on cushy campuses.\\nLike all powerful trends, though, this is ending. Don\\'t get me wrong. Tech companies are still hiring a lot of software engineers, and compensation is holding up so far. But the intensity, borne out of this talent supply-demand mismatch, is waning.\\nThe COVID-era tech hiring boom is partially to blame. Companies want fewer, better employees now.\\nGenerative AI is another big factor. Turns out, AI models are really good at writing and checking software code, changing the power dynamic between Big Tech and employees. It\\'s the topic of a story by BI reporters Eugene Kim and Hugh Langley.\\nDavid Sacks, a venture capitalist who advises the White House on AI, puts it well. \"The ramifications of moving from a world of code scarcity to code abundance are profound,\" he wrote on X recently.\\nThere\\'ll be A LOT more code, and way more software products that are updated and improved quicker, changing how developers work. Eugene\\'s exclusive on Amazon\\'s secret AI coding project, called Kiro, is a good example. \"With Kiro, developers read less but comprehend more, code less but build more, and review less but release more,\" the company wrote in an internal document.\\nHere\\'s another, more disruptive, potential outcome: Everyone can become a developer. In the past, if you wanted something technical done, you had to ask your well-paid, overworked engineering colleagues for help. Now, with AI tools, maybe you can do some of this yourself. Cursor, Vercel, Replit, and Bolt.new are just a few of the new low- or zero-code AI-powered services that help users solve problems with plain English instructions.\\nAll of that means the pool of available developers is likely to grow massively, and Big Tech companies will have to do a lot less talent-chasing.\\nIs now a good time to buy a house?\\nIt\\'s not a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" Recent economic uncertainty and steep prices have tainted the housing market for buyers. But they also have more options — and bargaining power.\\nIn BI\\'s second installment of its six-part series on making major life decisions, senior real estate reporter James Rodriguez broke it all down.\\nHow house hunters can come out strong.\\nAlso read:\\n- You\\'re in for a reality check if you want to job-hop right now\\n- It\\'s a chaotic world right now. Here\\'s why that makes it the ideal time to start a business.\\nThe battle of the robotaxis\\nTesla plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin this June, stepping on Waymo\\'s turf. But the two companies\\' approaches to driverless vehicles are pretty different.\\nBI compared their tech and business strategies to understand how each will gain ground. One company stands out as more autonomous.\\nAlso read:\\n- Texas is on the verge of handing Tesla and other big businesses a major win\\n- Uber CEO says the Waymo robotaxis on its app in Austin are busier than 99% of human drivers\\nRich to the rescue\\nLower- and middle-income people have scaled back spending, but the wealthy haven\\'t. Love \\'em or hate \\'em, rich people are propping up the US economy right now.\\nHowever, there are risks to having the economy depend on a small group of people. If things go south for the wealthy, they\\'ll take everyone else with them.\\nIt\\'s time to start rooting for the rich.\\nA Buffett-less future\\nWarren Buffett shocked investors at Berkshire Hathaway\\'s \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" last weekend by announcing his retirement from the company.\\nA BI reporter asked Buffett fans what they thought of the news. There were some tears, and plenty of anxiety about Berkshire\\'s future.\\nAlso read:\\n- I spent 8 hours in the cold to see Warren Buffett speak. I witnessed his retirement bombshell — and met Tim Cook and Hillary Clinton.\\n- Warren Buffett delivered a masterclass in succession planning — and a lesson in high drama\\nThis week\\'s quote:\\n\"People are increasingly grumpy because they can\\'t change jobs.\"\\n— Guy Berger, the director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, on Americans feeling stuck at the jobs they want to leave.\\nMore of this week\\'s top reads:\\n- We went to Milken, where the rich were worrying in public — and partying in private.\\n- Apple\\'s comments on Search gave investors one reason to worry about Google\\'s future. Here\\'s another.\\n- For Instagram creators, getting likes is no longer enough.\\n- A once-niche market for secondhand stakes in private funds is booming.

That made me stop and think-what\\'s going on here? It was an aha moment that made me question the effectiveness of traditional SEO.\\nWhen people ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or You.com questions, these AI systems dig into web content directly for answers-bypassing the traditional \"10 blue links.\" AI searchability means structuring your site so that AI can easily understand and extract your content, which is a completely different game from classic SEO.\\nAI Searchability vs. Traditional SEO\\nSEO has long been about keywords and backlinks to rank on search pages. AI-driven search goes further: it uses language models to grasp meaning and context. Instead of simple keyword matching, semantic understanding now drives relevance. In an AI answer, your content might be summarised or quoted directly rather than just linked. This means clarity and context matter more than ever.\\nA Few Steps to Make Your Site AI-Friendly\\n- Use Structured Content: Write with clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet points. Organize content using semantic HTML (like\\n<article>\\nand<section>\\ntags) so AI can parse it logically. For example, an FAQ section with concise Q&A pairs helps a chatbot quickly find direct answers. - Schema Markup & Metadata: Implement Schema.org structured data (Article, FAQ, Product schemas) and rich metadata. This gives AI context about your page. Proper schema and meta tags (titles, descriptions, OpenGraph tags) act as signposts, helping ChatGPT and other models understand your information (icenineonline.com).\\n- Write in Plain Language: A smart, conversational tone works best. Avoid unnecessary jargon – AI models prefer clarity. Content written in a Q&A style or that directly answers user questions is easily picked up by an AI looking for specific info.\\n- Optimise Crawlability: Ensure AI crawlers can reach your content. Update your XML sitemap and allow reputable AI bots via your\\nrobots.txt\\n(icenineonline.com). The more accessible your pages, the more likely they’ll be indexed and used in AI-generated answers. - Embrace Semantic SEO: Think beyond exact keywords. Cover topics in depth and use relevant terms so your content’s vector embeddings signal to AI which queries it’s suited for (wix.com).\\nThe Payoff: Visibility in AI Answers\\nBy making your site AI-friendly, you increase the chances of your content being featured in AI-generated responses.

In the era of generative AI, companies need more branded content and third-party mentions.\\nSome consumers are beginning to shop using ChatGPT, and digital marketing that’s geared toward web searches must shift too, experts say.\\nThe threat that generative AI poses to search engines was highlighted when Apple’s senior vice president of services said Safari web browsing recently decreased for the first time in 20 years, attributing it to users switching to large language models.\\nWhile Google refuted these claims, saying its search engine continues “to see overall query growth,” other data hints at ChatGPT’s influence in shopping.\\nBetween late October and mid January, Amazon.com was the most frequently visited domain referred from ChatGPT’s search function, accounting for 9.13% of all traffic, according to a survey by Datos.\\nOverall, e-commerce domains received 12.65%, trailing news (21.42%) and academic (17.81%) domains, Datos said.\\nThe increase in popularity to shop via AI alters a marketer’s approach to get eyes on their brand.\\nTraditional marketing techniques revolve around search engine optimization (SEO) practices to create a better chance of showing up on a user's Google query.\\nTo improve the odds that the search algorithm will raise a company’s visibility on the web, SEO practices focus on keywords, a site’s load time, and mobile-phone friendliness.\\nBut marketers now have to optimize for an investigative query from LLMs, which will pull from online content and third-party mentions. That includes a brand’s website and the general consensus on social media platforms like Reddit and X\\n“Until recently, digital marketing was all about winning the clicks. With the rise of LLMs, it is now all about winning the mentions,” Yaron Litwin, chief marketing officer of the Parent Control App, told Fortune.\\nAdvertisement\\nLike retail brands, the CMO of the content-filtering software business has adopted AI marketing to get ahead of the trend.\\nAnd when it comes to searching for the top-rated running shoes, for example, it’s “more of a conversation,” Erik Huberman, CEO of Hawke Media, a Los Angeles-based marketing company, told Fortune.\\nThe LLM will then give users options by explaining why each shoe is the best fit for that specific query.\\nWhile marketers are beginning to optimize for LLMs, Huberman said that the increase in ChatGPT shopping is “not significant enough yet to really throw anyone off.”\\n“So we haven't seen like a drop in organic traffic that’s anything concerning…no alarm bells have gone off, but we know it's coming, so we’re prepping for it,” he added.\\nHawke Media is partnering with Gumshoe, an AI optimization expert that helps marketers understand how their brands are perceived and talked about by LLMs by generating thousands of conversations using AI models.\\nAs LLMs take a holistic approach, Pietryla PR & Marketing President Christine Wetzler told Fortune that brand reputation is now “critical.”\\n“Credibility is being built outside your site now,” so companies must curate “brand storytelling,” Wetzler said.\\nBrand storytelling echoes the brands voice, in digestible content for an LLM, like articles, blogs, or on-site customer reviews.\\n“This is your new digital billboard,” Mongoose Media CEO Lauren Petrullo told Fortune. “If your company isn’t correctly represented, AI will fill in the blanks often inaccurately.”\\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\"}\n",

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice.\\nSolana (SOL), one of the top contenders in the blockchain ecosystem, continues to impress with its resilience and growth. Solana has maintained its position as a high-performance blockchain platform, trading at $172.39 and experiencing a 4.75% rise in the last 24 hours.\\nIts speed, scalability, and recent institutional partnerships highlight the promise of blockchain technology on a grand scale.\\nWhile Solana has already become a dominant player, many seek early-stage opportunities with comparable potential for exponential returns. Enter Ruvi, a new cryptocurrency project that aims to position itself as the next big thing in the blockchain space.\\nWith innovative technology, scarcity-focused tokenomics, and a lucrative presale, Ruvi could follow the trajectory that once propelled Solana to its success.\\nThe Rise of Solana\\nSince its inception, Solana has redefined expectations for blockchain performance with its Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus model. This innovation enables high transaction speeds and affordable fees, making it a favorite for developers, institutional players, and DeFi projects alike.\\nSolana’s recent market momentum, fueled by initiatives like tokenized equities and partnerships with institutional players, demonstrates its ability to reinvent itself while attracting massive on-chain activity and interest continually. The ecosystem’s maturity, however, means fewer entry points for achieving explosive returns, compared to those seen by its early adopters.\\nWhy Ruvi Is Poised to Shine\\nUnlike Solana, which focuses on scalability and DeFi infrastructure, Ruvi carves out its niche at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Ruvi’s ecosystem is built to solve practical challenges in predictive analytics and automation, offering unique solutions tailored for productivity across diverse industries.\\nAnother defining trait of Ruvi is its scarcity-focused tokenomics. Ruvi’s total token supply is capped at 5 billion, creating intrinsic value through limited availability. For comparison, Solana has more than 600 million tokens in circulation, making Ruvi a standout for scarcity-driven growth.\\nThe Presale Opportunity You Don’t Want to Miss\\nRuvi has launched its exclusive presale, positioning itself as the perfect entry point for those looking to tap into a high-growth blockchain project at its infancy. Tokens are priced at just $0.01, and presale participants enjoy significant bonus rewards designed to encourage early adoption.\\nLearn From Solana’s Success\\nSolana’s early holders reaped monumental rewards when it soared over 5400x from its seed sale price of $0.04 to its all-time high. Although the window for such returns on Solana is gone, Ruvi offers a new and exciting opportunity for exponential growth. With analysts forecasting Ruvi to achieve 200x–300x returns, the FOMO (fear of missing out) is real.\\nWhy Timing Is Everything\\nThe Ruvi presale provides a rare opportunity to secure tokens at their lowest price point and attractive bonus rewards. Once the presale closes and Ruvi is listed on major exchanges, these early incentives will be unavailable, and the token price is expected to rise significantly. Acting now ensures traders maximize their ROI potential while benefiting from early-stage advantages.\\nThe Future Belongs to Innovators\\nBy merging AI capabilities with blockchain technology, Ruvi sets itself apart as a project designed for the future of decentralized solutions. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics, visionary use cases, and early adoption incentives make it a compelling option for those seeking the next big crypto opportunity.\\nDon’t miss your chance to get in on the ground floor of this revolutionary project. Get in, Ruvi, today and position yourself at the forefront of blockchain and AI-driven innovation.\\nLearn More\\nBuy RUVI: https://presale.ruvi.io\\nWebsite: https://ruvi.io\\nWhitepaper: https://docs.ruvi.io\\nTelegram: https://t.me/ruviofficial\\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/RuviAI\\nTry RUVI AI: https://web.ruvi.io/register\\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article, and views in it do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, ZyCrypto.

Using AI to push through it can rob students of the chance to find their own arguments, and their voice.\\n‘Help me write’: AI can jump start your kid’s writing, but beware of the dangers | Opinion\\nAs I type this, a little gray message keeps popping up. “Help me write,” it offers whenever I pause for a certain length of time. It makes me chuckle, because writing is my job, and then grumble.\\nI don’t need the help to get started on a writing assignment, but this wasn’t always the case. Even though teachers complimented my writing, I struggled with getting started for years. But I practiced starting, and eventually finishing, writing assignments over and over again until it stopped being so hard.\\nMore than almost any skill I’ve learned to do over the years, I consider getting started my superpower. Now, I’m concerned that fewer people could learn it as ChatGPT and other generative AI becomes a beacon for students who are staring down a blank page on a deadline.\\nNot wanting to sit at my desk fretting about kids these days, I reached out to experts in AI and higher education. They too have their eye on the way students use AI in writing assignments. The good news is that instructors are making the potential pitfalls of AI as much a part of the curriculum as its possible uses. It comes down to teaching students the value of being human.\\nGareth Barkin, Dean of Operations and Technology at the University of Puget Sound, said professors there have a lot of discretion in how they limit or encourage the use of AI. It’s a balancing act, because writing an original essay or research paper teaches students critical thinking skills. But banning the tools altogether could leave graduates unprepared to work in a world where AI tools are prevalent.\\n“We don’t want to live in denial and imagine that these tools won’t be available,” Barkin said.\\nIt would be hard to say how much genuine writing ChatGPT and its ilk are replacing, since there have always been ways to get words on the screen without putting much thought into it. When it comes to outright cheating, the difference now is that a software program is doing the writing instead of another student who’s earning some money on the side (RIP to that income stream). There’s also old-fashioned, copy-paste plagiarism, and the dishonorable tradition of “BS-ing” your way through a writing assignment.\\nThe students I’m worried about are the ones who have a spark inside them, but find the process intimidating. Maybe they feel overwhelmed by an assignment that’s asking a lot more of them than they’re used to. Maybe they’re putting a lot of pressure on themselves, and need the courage to start even though the first few drafts won’t meet their own standards.\\nBarkin’s colleague, Julie Christoff, teaches rhetoric and composition at UPS. She agrees that students lose something by using AI tools to get started, which may be tempting because they’re worried their arguments aren’t strong enough.\\n“That really short-circuits the thinking process,” she said.\\nAlternatively, free-writing and brainstorming with other humans can help students discover and refine their own ideas. In addition to making time for students to do these activities, teachers can make it clear during class time that they care about what their students have to say, Christoff said.\\nImproving is humbling. You have to be at least a little bad at something before you can be competent. Personally, I’ve dealt with a cycle of perfectionism, procrastination and self-loathing. That sounds something like, “I need this piece of writing to be amazing. I’m avoiding starting because the fear of failing is deeply unpleasant. Now I have even less time to make this amazing, it’s my fault, I’m a piece of garbage.” Rinse and repeat.\\nA little gray message offering to “help” me write might have been all too tempting as I learned to overcome this. And maybe it would have made my life a little better in the short run. There’s an argument to be made for using generative AI to write a first draft that you then write over to include your style, stronger arguments and important details that got left out by the machine.\\nBut most professional writers will tell you that they already do the equivalent of ChatGPT’s job in this scenario. They smash out a first draft, turning off their inner critic as much as they can and getting something on the page. Then they write over it. (Some people claim writing just comes out of them onto the page in its final form. Those people are the worst.)\\nBy making this process an ordinary part of my life, I’ve made huge personal progress in breaking that cycle of procrastination and, frankly, mean thoughts about myself. I still avoid some things that feel extremely important to me, but the level of pain this causes in my life is much lower than it once was.\\nBarkin points out that students need to learn to push through this process if they’re going to go on to use AI effectively in the workplace. Maybe they’ll need to bring a human eye to something written by ChatGPT, giving it a thorough edit to catch random errors and add nuance and clarity.\\nYou can’t do a good job of editing something written by AI, Barkin said, “until you learn to write convincingly and clearly yourself.”\\nTo do that, you have to get started.'}\n",

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\\nWhen I started applying for jobs earlier this year, I figured my best shot at landing interviews was to optimize my résumé as much as possible.\\nOne of the most effective strategies I used was asking AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to rate my résumé — both overall and by section — on a scale from one to 10 (one being the worst and 10 being the best).

Then, to gather a broader range of insights, I did the same with Gemini.\\nWhile I didn't spend much time tailoring my résumé to each individual job description, I did create separate versions for the four main types of roles I was targeting: technical lead, staff engineer, engineering manager, and principal engineer. I asked the AI tools to help me craft résumés for each of these roles and rate my résumés along the way. My target score was eight or better.\\nThings got a bit confusing at times. For instance, ChatGPT might rate one version of my résumé a nine, while Gemini gave it a seven — and it wasn't always clear why. The feedback could also be inconsistent. If I asked ChatGPT to suggest improvements to a résumé it had scored as a seven, applying those changes might raise the score to a nine. But if I uploaded that revised résumé to a new ChatGPT chat, I'd sometimes get a different score.\\nOver time, it became clear that these tools didn't follow a consistent scoring system. Their ratings were based on the context of each conversation I'd have with the AI tool: which résumé version I shared, how I framed my questions, and what criteria were being applied.\\nReceiving a perfect 10 was difficult, though I managed it at certain points. I never asked the AI tools to generate a résumé that would score a perfect 10, because I wanted to ensure they wouldn't hallucinate or include inaccurate information. Instead, I focused on refining my résumé using the tools' suggestions.\\nIn the end, it didn't matter much whether all my résumés scored a perfect 10. What mattered was that I felt the AI feedback was helping me keep improving my résumé.\\nOnce I felt I had a solid résumé on hand, I started applying to a few jobs to see how I'd fare. If I didn't hear back from employers, I'd revisit the AI tools to make additional tweaks. When I began having more success, I felt confident that my résumé was in a strong place.\\nAI also helped organize and format my résumé\\nThe most helpful part of using AI tools to improve my résumé was getting clear, real-time feedback and practical suggestions for how to make it better. The AI helped me reword things to sound clearer and more effective, include the right keywords to get past applicant tracking systems, and organize my experience in a way that made my accomplishments stand out. It also made it easy to go through multiple résumé drafts quickly, adjusting the language and layout until my résumé felt polished. If I had to pick the AI tool I found most useful, I'd say Gemini.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBesides asking the AI tools to rate my résumé, I also asked for advice on formatting, help comparing different versions, and suggestions for how to tailor it for specific jobs — including senior roles and applications to top tech companies. I also got tips on how to rewrite sections like my professional summary to sound more focused, impactful, and leadership-oriented.\\nOverall, using AI this way helped make sure my résumé matched what companies were looking for and gave me a better shot at landing competitive roles.\\nHuman connections and internet research were also helpful\\nIn addition to using AI tools to improve my résumé, I also used them to refine my cover letters and run mock interviews to sharpen both my behavioral and technical responses.\\nHowever, I can't credit all of my job search success to AI tools. When I first set out to improve my résumé, I started by conducting research on the latest trends for tech role applications. I found out that simply listing my skills wasn't enough: To make it through applicant tracking systems, I needed to highlight concrete accomplishments from my past roles.\\nSome of the best feedback I got during my job search didn't come from an AI tool, but from a former coworker. He suggested I limit my job search to no more than two hours a day, set aside time to stay sharp on job-related skills — including some involving AI — and then spend the rest of the day with my family. Looking back, I think that was very wise advice.\"}\n",

This brings the company’s total raised capital to $24M.\\nThe round was led by GV (Google Ventures). Workday Ventures, XTX Ventures, Episode 1, Playfair, and individual investors from OpenAI, DeepMind, Microsoft, and Mulesoft also joined the round.\\nLuna Schmid, Partner at GV, says, “What impressed us most about StackOne is its ambition and clarity. Romain and Guillaume aren’t building just another SaaS integration platform. They’re creating infrastructure that modern software and the entire AI agent ecosystem can rely on. The depth of secure integrations, the pace of delivery, and the team’s foresight into AI’s future uniquely position StackOne to redefine this category.”\\nThe company will use the funds to develop its tool-calling language model, invest in research and development, and increase the number of integrations and available actions on its platform.\\nFueling innovation by connecting software\\nStackOne is addressing integration challenges faced by software platforms, which depend on connections with other tools to operate.\\nTasks such as recruitment, security alerts, and HR processes often rely on integrations between AI agents and enterprise systems. These connections are a top concern for 83 per cent of B2B buyers, but 71 per cent of SaaS companies still take over three weeks to launch a single integration, resulting in delays and lost opportunities.\\nFounders Romain Sestier and Guillaume Lebedel encountered these issues over a decade of building SaaS products at companies like Google, Oracle, and Yieldify.\\nAs AI agents become more common, the need for new integration methods is increasing. Existing standards, such as Model Context Protocol, provide direction but fall short in areas required for enterprise use.\\nStackOne responds to this by introducing a new integration method using a proprietary AI agent and real-time engine. This approach helps teams link SaaS products and AI agents with enterprise systems more efficiently.\\nCo-founder, Romain Sestier, says, “For over a decade, Guillaume and I have felt the acute pain of integrations. We’d see teams burn months rebuilding or refusing requests and nothing on the market eased this pain. So we, alongside a super-talented and passionate team, built it ourselves.”\\n“StackOne doesn’t just reinvent how integration platforms can and should be built – with depth, accuracy and security by default – but we believe AI agents are the missing piece in finally delivering enterprise-grade integrations at scale.”\\n“It’s the platform we’d always dreamed of, built for the AI future of SaaS, and it’s a vision shared by the whole team. This shared experience has shaped a culture of innovation, collaboration and deep care for the product we’re building and it shows.”\\nCurrently, the platform provides access to over 3,000 actions across 200+ connectors, streamlining integrations across various systems such as HR, CRM, ticketing, and identity access management. This approach ensures that integrations are secure and up-to-date, allowing developers to focus on scaling and product development.\\nBuilding an AI developer community\\nStackOne is also developing an AI developer community through initiatives like AI Demo Days, which bring together researchers, builders, and infrastructure teams, and by contributing to open-source projects.\\nThis effort supports StackOne’s goal of becoming a central hub for those working on AI-powered software integration.\\nCo-founder and CTO, Guillaume Lebedel, says, “Integrations are now table stakes for winning and keeping customers in B2B SaaS, especially for the ever-growing swathe of AI agents.”\\n“You only need to look at the rise of standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to see the demand, but these protocols just aren’t fit for enterprise use by themselves – they’re a small piece of the puzzle. They lack security, accuracy and scale. They don’t work with multi-tenant systems, they’re too restrictive for the complex needs of big business, and they don’t go deep enough.”\\n“StackOne solves all of this in a single layer; one that marks the birth of a new generation of integrations platform for an AI-first world.”\\nBarbry McGann, Managing Director and SVP at Workday Ventures, adds, “We’ve been impressed by how quickly and deeply StackOne integrates with complex enterprise systems – and now, with their focus on agent-to-agent interoperability, they’re unlocking even more powerful use cases for customers.”\\n“In a space where speed and scale often trade off with reliability, compliance, and functionality, StackOne delivers all of the above in a universal layer – without compromise.”\\n01\\nWhy use EDI?

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach by enhancing students’ perceptions of competence, control, and value while transforming teacher-student interactions. This paper advocates for a research agenda exploring AI’s role in shaping achievement emotions and calls for a broader shift in educational research toward leveraging AI for meaningful and transformative learning experiences.\\nIntroduction\\nWe offer here a call-to-action for researchers and educators as they respond to the ever-growing presence of various implementations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our schools and universities. We make this call based on our critique of the dominant discourses around AI in the year following the release of ChatGPT; that is, the discussion has been too focussed on the products of education—the lesson plan, the essay, the multi-media presentation—and not sufficiently on the processes of learning.\\nThe distinction we make between the products of education and the processes of learning can be a fine one but, in the context of considering the role of AI in education, it should not be understated. When we talk about the use of a technology such as AI, it can be very easy to think in very linear and business-like terms with respect to the efficient production of the things we have traditionally used to signify learning. It can be even easier to forget that those things have been used as signifiers and not as the actual object of education. In short, the purpose of education is not to produce artefacts such as essays. Rather, the essay is a tool we use with the objective of transforming the understanding of the student.\\nThese concerns take on new urgency in the context of AI’s expanding role in education. The term AI has been in use for nearly 75 years since Turing1 posed the question, ‘Can machines think?’ Over the decades, progress in the field has fluctuated, moving through various stages of artificial intelligence and towards the aspirational goals of artificial general intelligence and artificial superintelligence2. At the heart of these evolving conceptions of AI is the idea of machines “behaving in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving3.” While contemporary AI systems are undeniably sophisticated, we argue that they are not yet truly intelligent in the human sense. This said, we do not dismiss the possibility of future developments in general artificial intelligence. For the purposes of this article, we intentionally adopt a broad definition of AI, one that avoids a purely technocentric perspective and instead keeps open the question of how these tools might be meaningfully integrated into the learning process.\\nWith this distinctly educational purpose in mind, we seek to use this short article to promote an agenda of educational research and implementation that gives consideration to the use of AI as a means to support student learning in the deeper sense of achieving significant developmental transformations. By way of example, our focus here will be on potential roles for AI in cultivating students’ socio-emotional learning (SEL), and we will give particular attention to the persistent problem of mathematics anxiety (maths anxiety). The paper will begin with a short outline of this educational ambition, before turning to a discussion of potential AI use cases that might address it.\\nManaging mathematics anxiety: a socio-emotional learning goal\\nThe desire to reduce students’ maths anxiety provides an instructive example of how our research and design focus can, if we consider the role of AI, move from the products that represent learning to the underlying educational goals. In the context of mathematics education, SEL can play a crucial role in reducing mathematics anxiety, as it provides students with the emotional and cognitive resources needed to regulate and balance the challenges of learning mathematics.\\nMaths anxiety remains a significant challenge in schools worldwide. Maths anxiety is an emotional response characterised by a sense of fear, tension, and apprehension when it comes to mathematical tasks and tests4. For many students, this anxiety can be so paralysing that it hinders their mathematical learning and performance. While it is normal to feel some level of anxiety when encountering challenging subjects, excessive maths anxiety can lead to avoidance, reduced self-confidence and reduced feelings of control, and even long-term aversion to mathematical learning5. Maths anxiety is not confined to the school classroom and has been found to be prevalent across the adult population6, often manifesting early in middle school students7.\\nIn essence, maths anxiety appears when the subjective appraisal of a student’s control over a situation involving mathematics is uncertain and the focus of thoughts revolves around the anticipation and fear of failure8. According to the Control-Value Theory of Achievement Emotions, anxiety in educational contexts can be understood as the feeling that arises when students place value on a subject like mathematics but perceive a lack of control over their performance in it9. When they value the subject but feel uncertain about their abilities, maths anxiety tends to emerge10.\\nFigure 1 presents a much simplified and sharply focussed model of the process of learning mathematics. In this model we suppose that the underlying educational goal in having students successfully complete the mathematics activities (the hexagon) is the development of students’ SEL (the square). That is, the activity is a ‘means’, it is not the ‘ends’. Key to this is the provision of educationally appropriate learning activities ①. Also contributing to an increased likelihood of success in these activities is a student’s own appraisal of the control ② and value ③ they have over the process with which they engage with these activities. The teacher is able to take various actions, such as tailoring the relevance of the activity for the student, to cause an increase in the perceived value of the learning and thus increase the likelihood of success. However, an unintended consequence of this action might be a corresponding increase in maths anxiety ④. A student may be able to use their emotional self-regulation to dampen (indicated by the balancing loop B1) this change in maths anxiety, or their appraisal of an increased level of control of their learning may result in a reduction in maths anxiety (indicated by ).\\nTwo reinforcing loops exist in this model. R1 indicates that success in the learning activity can lead to improvements in the underlying educational goal of SEL development. In turn, this leads to greater perception of control in learning activities leading to an increased likelihood of success in future activities. Secondly, R2 shows that an increased perception of control leads to a reduction in maths anxiety which in turn leads to further increases in the perception of control. However, it must be noted that while these reinforcing loops can be helpful in increasing a student’s perception of control, they can also have undesirable consequences. For example, R2 also indicates that a perceived loss of control can result in an increase in maths anxiety which then leads to further reductions in perceived control. It is important to stress that the model presented here is not intended to be complete representation of the process of learning. Rather it serves to highlight that effectively addressing the complex issues around students’ emotions and learning outcomes requires new thinking, and in this pursuit, AI emerges as a valuable ally.\\nThe provision of highly tailored, high quality learning activities, facilitated by the teacher (as indicated by the mortarboard icon), plays an important role in ensuring that students experience greater frequency of success than difficulty in their learning. Of course, we also need to recognise the value of productive struggle in reshaping students’ self-perceptions and fostering resilience. Research highlights the importance of allowing students to engage in tasks that are appropriately challenging11,12. Overcoming difficulty, rather than succeeding solely because tasks are perceived as “easy”, can provide students with a sense of accomplishment, and build their confidence. It is also essential to recognise that a highly trained expert teacher who knows their students and how they learn, is invariably the best placed individual to make these assessments. However, the realities of a classroom environment where one teacher may be working with thirty students, means that there is very little time in a 1-h lesson for this individual assessment to occur. AI systems, that can process multiple streams of complicated information in parallel, can start to address this issue by identifying moments when students are ready to tackle more complex challenges and take action either directly or indirectly though the teacher.\\nImportantly, we acknowledge that individualised reference points for autonomy and self-regulated learning (SRL) may be beneficial in impacting how students engage with processes like those described in Fig. 1. It is evident that not all students will benefit equally from the same SRL-focused intervention, and this may be particularly true for those students who may initially struggle with self-directed learning. It is equally evident that students will each respond differently to any feedback provided and thus each student will need their own tailored mix of information13. The CVT takes into account the role of individual appraisals in shaping emotional responses, acknowledging that students’ perceptions of control and value can vary significantly across individuals and situations. From a measurement perspective this implies that absolute measurements of these constructs may not be helpful and that relative measurements of how these change over time may be more informative. This level of fine granularity in students’ starting points, is difficult for a single teacher with limited resources to achieve in reality and might lead to the idea of ‘teaching to the middle’ rather than teaching to the individual. However, this highly pattern-based approach to measurement is ideally suited to a machine based (AI) solution. It also highlights the need for adaptive systems that can differentiate between students based on their unique profile and tailor interventions accordingly. AI has the potential to revolutionise this space by monitoring individual learning patterns over time and offering personalised learning experiences14 with finer granularity than a human teacher can achieve alone. Furthermore, by keeping educators in the feedback loop they will be able to identify which students may require more structured guidance and which students are ready for more autonomous tasks and thus the face-to-face teacher-student dynamic will change.\\nDesigning a role for AI within a system of educational activity\\nFigure 1 also indicates the potential for AI (the robot icon) to contribute to the development of the underlying educational goals (SEL development in this example), as well as assisting in mediating both the balancing and reinforcing feedback loops (B1 and R2) associated with emotions. Some of these envisaged points for interaction are autonomous, where the robot icon appears alone, and some are supervised, where the robot and mortarboard coexist. It is important to note that these potential points of AI support are entirely indicative and the examples that are presented here are general suggestions.\\nBefore exploring Fig. 1 in detail, it is important that we emphasise the cyclical nature of this model. Learning does not happen as a one-off event. Rather the objects of education (SEL development in this example) result in a series of changes in other quantities that are then available for use in future cycles. It is also essential to recognise that the system presented in Fig. 1 is incomplete and forms just one sub-system in a much more complex process. That is, there will be other factors in the larger system connected to the nodes of our model that are not represented here (e.g., resilience). For this reason, it is important that students experience both successes in learning and difficulties. Each will cause different emotional responses, and the larger system will respond in different ways potentially developing attributes like perseverance that are not represented here. Any AI implementations that become incorporated into this system need to ensure that they are designed to respond appropriately to both success and difficulty in ways that enhance the underlying educational objectives without disempowering students or their teachers or shortcutting the learning processes.\\nWorking from our conceptual model (Fig. 1), we propose six general areas where AI may be able to provide mechanisms or approaches that support the learning process. From these we have identified specific elements of learning design that may be targeted for research, improvement, or modification. These objects of transformation and their associated design goals are presented in Table 1 along with possible AI application strategies and examples of implementation.\\nFirstly, supporting teachers to provide mathematical learning activities that are personalised at an appropriate level of complexity to match the cognitive abilities of individual students is essential. The strengths of current approaches to AI lie in their ability to mimic human processes, using vastly larger quantities of data, and with far greater speed that humans can achieve. When an AI is presented with a problem that is similar to ones it has ‘seen’ before, then it is reasonable to expect the algorithm to follow a similar process in generating output. Therefore, the implementation of some form of semi-supervised, or even unsupervised, algorithm to analyse each student’s past and current learning performance and/or mastery data and to suggest learning pathways for them to follow or to dynamically adjust the task demands to an appropriate level would be a potentially effective use for an AI learning support. Such an implementation would appear at ① in Fig. 1 and provide personalised challenges that maintain an optimal balance between task demand and cognitive quality of instruction. These individualised learning experiences will align with each student’s proficiency level, minimising their frustration and enhancing the likelihood of successful learning outcomes. However, personalisation should not be limited to task difficulty alone. AI can help pinpoint specific moments where students struggle, providing feedback that is not only task-focused but also supports positive appraisals of their efforts. For example, AI-driven systems can identify when a student shows signs of frustration or disengagement and offer supportive feedback that highlights their progress and effort rather than solely focusing on task completion. This can help students reinterpret their experiences as opportunities for learning, thereby fostering a more positive self-concept and increasing their motivation. An algorithm such as this would be best suited for general implementation by resource producers, as they would have ready access to the large amounts of data needed to establish the parameters of the algorithm. However, in a semi-supervised arrangement, some system or process would need to be developed to allow the classroom teacher to provide input and fine tune the algorithm in a straightforward and intuitive way.\\nExtending the idea of performance monitoring to student self-monitoring, AI algorithms can be used to enhance learners’ perceptions of agency and control and might be utilised at ② in Fig. 1. Using a large set of learning performance data a resource producer could develop a predictive model that gives students a selection of recommended next steps for their own personalised learning yet remains within the same area of knowledge that the teacher has assigned. In this conception, the AI algorithm essentially creates a decision tree for building learning pathways but leaves the final step of the process, the decision itself, up to the student. Built into such a predictive system would be the opportunity for learning analytics that could build an understanding of each student’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses and provide nudges to assist the student in achieving their own stated goals. AI-enabled tools might also be used in creative learning environments encourage cooperation and thus cultivating positive social interactions. These tools might include interactive and collaborative platforms where students can explore mathematical concepts independently and engage in cooperative problem-solving activities. AI can also contribute to the development of enhanced feelings of control and growth through individualised achievement goal structures and expectations; approaches that are key in reducing maths anxiety.\\nAI may also assist teachers in enhancing students’ value induction ③ which is an important facet of learning success. AI search engines have access to an almost endless volume of information that could be used to select contexts or situations that highlight the real-world applications and uses of mathematical problems in a way that is relevant to individual students. Such an approach can contribute to students’ understanding of the intrinsic value of mathematical knowledge15.\\nChatbots based on large language models (LLMs) have become particularly effective in recent years. While chatbots are still far from perfect, the ability to sideload an LLM with an appropriate set of background data files, does offer educators the possibility to use these algorithms in a safe and closed environment while ensuring that the chatbot has access to only appropriate additional information and not the entire unfiltered web. Adopting such an approach has the added advantage that the LLM itself can be smaller allowing it to run on prosumer level local hardware and removing the need to run on massive cloud infrastructure. The use of an AI approach like this to assist students in moderating feedback loops, such as the one at ④, has great potential for research and impact16. As noted, there is a reinforcing loop between perceptions of control and maths anxiety (R1 in Fig. 1). In a traditional classroom, this feedback loop might be driven by general reflection on the task and its success criteria analysing what the student got wrong and how to fix this. This type of feedback needs to be carefully supervised to ensure that unhelpful self-talk does not dominate the process. An AI chatbot can help to reframe these reflections to consider how an individual has developed in multiple ways while engaging with the learning activities and reduce the dichotomous focus on success vs. failure.\\nFurthermore, retraining students’ notions of failure and success becomes feasible through AI interventions that emphasise the iterative nature of learning and the value of the underlying educational goal. Such AI tools placed at ⑤ could promote the use of personal micro-targets for students and shift the focus of the cognitive process away from the learning activity and onto this deeper learning goal, AI-driven interventions can lead to a shift in student mindset as they learn to view setbacks as opportunities for growth and reduce the anxiety associated with performance.\\nHowever, while current AI tools are capable of ‘decision making’ using large amounts of mostly structured data, they lack the capability to genuinely understand and adapt to the emotional and cognitive needs of students. The AI models tend to focus more on the mechanics of teaching rather than the emotional well-being of the learner. That is, currently available AI tools are more focussed on the products of learning than on the human process of learning. To truly harness the potential of AI in transforming mathematics education, we need to prioritise different research goals. Researchers should therefore aim to develop new systems and approaches that foster a deeper, more intuitive understanding of mathematical concepts, rather than just improving the efficiency of content delivery.\\nFor example, we know that self-regulation of emotions is essential in order to manage adverse situations such as maths anxiety. Natural language processing algorithms might be developed to identify the fingerprints of both positive and negative emotional meaning in students’ extended textual responses. This might be supplemented with data gathered through multi-modal learning analytics—such as computer vision and audio analysis—to track non-lingual cues such as facial expressions, tonal variation and gestures17. Together such a dataset might be able to be used to provide support and strategies, both virtual and real-life, that can assist students in developing their self-regulation and emotional moderation. Such a technology might have a place at ③ or ⑥ in Fig. 1.\\nAn ethical dilemma\\nWith regard to each of the potential applications for AI outlined here and elsewhere their remains an enormous elephant in the room. AI algorithms can only explore patterns in data and provide students and teachers with appropriate feedback if appropriate data is first collected. Thus, it is almost certain that different, or at least modified, didactical tools will need to be developed and used as part of the learning process. Tools already exist that can run on a student’s own device to collect digital interaction data and provide individualised feedback when writing. Students may have access to devices to record video and audio to demonstrate their learning processes which can then be uploaded to a learning management system and subsequently analysed in partnership with AI. Training classrooms have been established to capture group interactions using video and audio recognition combined with positional information that can inform educators about the development of group dynamics. However, each of these sources of additional data comes with increased risks regarding data security, increased costs regarding equipment purchase and maintenance, and increasingly complex challenges regarding the ethics of collecting and using the data. Additionally, each source of data will be associated with the need for training and pedagogical changes and will have impacts, both positive and negative, on teacher autonomy, well-being, and flexibility.\\nIn our proposed AI use cases, we need to emphasise the importance of educators and providers using data responsibly and transparently to enhance learning without compromising ethical standards. It is easy to see how any of the approaches suggested here could raise ethical questions around data ownership, privacy, and even a person’s right to choose to not engage with a particular tool or technology. However, the details of such discussions would be legion and need to be very specific to the actual technological approach adopted. We will therefore not go further into these points here as much has already been written on the topic of AI ethics18,19. However, we will state definitively that all such concerns must be explored in a wide-ranging and good-faith manner and emergent issues comprehensively addressed before any new technology is implemented. Educational leaders and policy makers must make research-informed decisions rather than relying on intuition or convenience. As historical examples have shown, for example the widespread adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT into every software product under the sun, it is far too easy to put off doing this essential governance until after the horse has bolted, by which point it is too late to consider the consequences and closing the gate is no longer an option.\\nAgenda for AI implementation research\\nThe integration of AI into mathematics education has the potential to revolutionise the field. It can transform the teacher-student dynamic and holds immense potential for enhancing both academic achievement and emotional responses among students. Addressing issues such as maths anxiety requires a positive impact on students’ emotions, particularly in fostering perceptions of competence and control over academic activities. In exploring AI-supported SEL in mathematics education, we propose an agenda that investigates how human-computer interactions go beyond enhancing to actually transform teaching practice20. Our research agenda, centred around three main points, systematically addresses key aspects contributing to SEL and aims to alleviate students’ maths anxiety.\\n(1) Individualised learning, achievement goals and expectations: an interesting avenue of investigation lies in leveraging AI to tailor individual achievement goals and expectations for students. By setting achievable and realistic goals based on each student’s unique abilities, AI can enhance motivation and self-efficacy. This individualisation not only helps in addressing maths anxiety but also fosters a sense of accomplishment as students witness their progress aligned with personalised benchmarks.\\n(2) Moderating feedback mechanisms: researchers could also explore the integration of AI systems that provide real-time emotional feedback during classroom activities. For example, sentiment analysis algorithms could gauge students’ emotional responses to mathematical challenges. Teachers, armed with this data, can adjust their teaching approaches on the fly, offering additional support or introducing activities to alleviate anxiety. Another interesting avenue for research could focus on the development and implementation of AI-driven virtual teaching assistants explicitly designed to provide emotional support. These assistants could engage in natural language conversations with students, offering encouragement, motivation, and strategies to manage maths anxiety.\\n(3) Emotion regulation: future research could focus on developing and investigating the impact of comprehensive AI-driven student dashboards that offer insights into a student’s socio-emotional development and academic progress. These dashboards could generate personalised progress reports that not only highlight academic achievement, but also provide insights into students’ emotional responses during maths activities, their collaboration skills, and overall engagement. By making these dashboards accessible to students, AI serves as a bridge, facilitating transparent communication and metacognitive discussions, as well as supporting emotion regulation. These elements are all essential in both preventing and addressing the symptoms of maths anxiety21,22.\\nWe propose a multi-method approach to investigate the effectiveness of AI implementations in addressing SEL and maths anxiety. The methodology we suggest includes a combination of qualitative (e.g., interviews and focus groups with educators and students, case studies) and quantitative methods (e.g., surveys, psychometric assessments) to capture a comprehensive view of the impact of AI-driven interventions. Additionally, experimental studies can be designed to test the effectiveness of specific AI interventions, comparing traditional teaching approaches with AI-enhanced learning environments.\\nTo address the complexities of human-computer interactions, we advocate for a structured research approach incorporating both detailed case studies and longitudinal studies. Specifically, we propose conducting case studies in diverse educational settings that observe how students and teachers interact with AI tools across varying socio-economic and cultural contexts. These case studies would include the use of video recordings of classroom interactions, detailed logs of AI feedback loops, and interviews with teachers to identify specific instructional adjustments made in response to AI insights. Additionally, longitudinal studies should follow cohorts of students over the course of an academic year, tracking their progress through regular psychometric assessments, classroom observations, and emotional feedback reports. By triangulating data from these methods, researchers can capture the nuanced shifts in students’ perceptions of competence, control, and anxiety. Such an approach would also allow for the identification of key factors that enhance or hinder the long-term effectiveness of AI interventions in transforming teaching practices and emotional responses to mathematics learning.\\nIn essence, the proposed research agenda envisions AI not merely as a tool for product-oriented tasks but as a transformative force, where human-computer interactions lead to an expansion of practice. Through this framework, we seek to go beyond the conventional understanding of AI in education and explore its potential to reshape teaching practices fundamentally. By delving into the nuanced ways in which AI can enhance emotional responses, foster perceptions of competence, and provide support mechanisms for students experiencing maths anxiety, this research agenda aspires to offer practical solutions that transform the educational landscape. Ultimately, this endeavour envisions AI not only as a facilitator of academic achievement but as a catalyst for a profound shift in the dynamics of mathematics education, emphasising personalised and emotionally supportive approaches.\\nReferences\\nTuring, A.

With a background in journalism and the humanities that sets him apart in Silicon Valley, Clark offers a refreshingly sober assessment of AI’s economic impact—predicting growth of 3-5% rather than the 20-30% touted by techno-optimists—based on his firsthand experience of repeatedly underestimating AI progress while still recognizing the physical world’s resistance to digital transformation.\\nIn this conversation, Jack and Tyler explore which parts of the economy AGI will affect last, where AI will encounter the strongest legal obstacles, the prospect of AI teddy bears, what AI means for the economics of journalism, how competitive the LLM sector will become, why he’s relatively bearish on AI-fueled economic growth, how AI will change American cities, what we’ll do with abundant compute, how the law should handle autonomous AI agents, whether we’re entering the age of manager nerds, AI consciousness, when we’ll be able to speak directly to dolphins, AI and national sovereignty, how the UK and Singapore might position themselves as AI hubs, what Clark hopes to learn next, and much more.\\nListen to the full conversation\\nRecorded March 28th, 2025\\nRead the full transcript\\nThanks to an anonymous listener for sponsoring this transcript.\\nTYLER COWEN: Hello everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. Today, I am at Anthropic with Jack Clark. As you may know, there is now an Anthropic Economic Index which is measuring the effect of advanced AI on the US economy. There are two associated reports as of March 2025, and soon, more to come. Jack, of course, is the co-founder of Anthropic. Before that, he was the policy director at OpenAI, a reporter at Bloomberg, and originally, has his background in the humanities. He comes from Brighton, England. Jack, welcome.\\nJACK CLARK: Well, thanks for having me, Tyler. Pleasure to be here.\\nCOWEN: Where is it in our economy that AGI will affect last in a significant manner?\\nCLARK: Ooh, I’d hazard a guess that it’s going to be things that are the trades and the most artisanal parts of them. You might think of trades as having things like electricians or plumbing, or also things like gardening. I think within those, you get certain high-status, high-skill parts, where people want to use a certain tradesman, not just because of their skill but because of their notoriety and sometimes an aesthetic quality. I think that my take might be gardening, actually.\\nCOWEN: They won’t use AGI to help design the garden? Or just the human front will never disappear?\\nCLARK: I think the human front will never disappear. People will purchase certain things because of the taste of the person, even if that taste looks like certain types of modern art production, where the artist actually backs onto thousands of people that work for them, and they’re more orchestrating it.\\nCOWEN: How about in the more desk-bound part of the service sector? Where will it come last?\\nCLARK: Come last? Ooh, good question. I think that on this, there are certain types of desk-bound work that just require talking to other people and getting to alignment or agreement. If you count certain types of sales —\\nCOWEN: But it’s great at doing that already, right? It’s a wonderful therapist.\\nCLARK: It is, but we don’t send Claude to sell Claude, yet. We send people to sell Claude, even though Claude could probably generate the text to do the sales motion. People want to do commerce with other people, so I think that there’ll be certain relationships which get mediated by people, and people will have a strong preference, probably, for deals that they make on behalf of their larger pools of capital, where the deals are done by human proxies for large automated organizations or pools of capital.\\nCOWEN: Where will AGI encounter the strongest legal obstacles?\\nCLARK: I think a few years ago, it was encountering quite strong obstacles in the law itself because lawyers tended to like being able to charge very high prices and had a dislike of things that could bid them down.\\nMy less flippant answer is, probably big chunks of healthcare because it’s bound up in certain things around how we handle personal data, all of the standards around that. All of those standards are probably going to need to be changed in some form to make them amenable to being used by AI. We’ve had a really hard time updating or changing data standards in general.\\nCOWEN: Once you can put the AI on your own hard drive, which will be pretty soon, won’t that all change?\\nCLARK: It will change in the form of gray market expertise, but not official expertise. I had a baby recently. Whenever my baby bonks their head, while I’m dialing the advice nurse, I talk to Claude just to reassure myself that the baby isn’t in trouble.\\nI don’t think we actually fully permit healthcare uses via our own terms of service. We don’t recommend it because we’re worried about all of the liability issues this contains, but I know through my revealed preference that I’m always going to want to use that, but I can’t take that Claude assessment and give it to Kaiser Permanente. I actually have to talk through a human to get everything else to happen on the back end to work out if they need to prescribe my child something.\\nCOWEN: So, the number one job will be surreptitiously transmitting the generation of information that comes from AIs, in essence?\\nCLARK: Some of it may be that. Some of it is about laundering the information that comes from AIs into human systems that are not predisposed to that information going in directly.\\nCOWEN: I was thinking you might say the United States government, or some parts of it, would be where strong AI would come last. I think that would be my forecast. They still use software from the ’60s or maybe even the ’50s sometimes.\\nCLARK: They do, but I actually suspect that that could be a place where we see really rapid changes, actually, and for a couple of reasons. One, we know that AI has relevance to national security. It develops certain types of capabilities.\\nCOWEN: Oh, yes, that will happen quickly —\\nCLARK: Yes, that’ll happen quickly.\\nCOWEN: — but the rest of government.\\nCLARK: The rest of government.\\nCOWEN: The Department of Education, HHS, HUD.\\nCLARK: The non-scary, sharp parts of government. I would wager that it will become surprisingly easy to get it into really hard parts of government, and then there will be a question of political will. All around the world — and I’m sure you experience this — governments desperately want growth, and they desperately want efficiency. We see that here today in —\\nCOWEN: Do they?\\nCLARK: They say that.\\nCOWEN: Oh, I agree there.\\n[laughter]\\nCLARK: But I think if you look at, also, things like voter polling and other things, people want to see more changes out of government than they’re currently getting. I think, sometimes, constituent preferences do ultimately change what their elected officials do. I would just take the other side of this, that government may move slightly faster than you think. It may be very large, established companies that end up having some of the greatest resistance to this in certain areas.\\nCOWEN: Let’s say it was decided that half of the staff of HUD or Department of Education could be replaced by strong AI or AGI. Do we first need to hire more people to make that happen? Who is it we can hire and at what wage that switches the system so you can lay off the remaining half? I don’t understand how that’s ever going to work.\\nCLARK: I think that it will only work in a scenario where the system has got so powerful that you can bring the AI system in itself to help you think through this. Then there will be a question of political will, which is where this all might break down.\\nCOWEN: What do you think is the chance that we decide to protect, say, half of the jobs in existence today with laws analogous to those we find in law and medicine against strong AGI?\\nCLARK: I think there is a high chance for a political movement to arrive which tries to freeze a load of human jobs in bureaucratic amber as a way to deal with the political issues posed by this incredibly powerful technology and how fast the changes are going to come from. I don’t think that we’ll do this in a reasoned way. I think it’ll be driven by the chaotic winds of political forces.\\nIt feels like the sort of outcome that happens if we, as the companies building this stuff, and our customers don’t generate enough examples of what good transitions look like. The fewer bits of evidence you have there and the more evidence you have of larger economic changes, probably the higher chance there’ll be a desire to step in and protect workers in different domains, which comes from an impulse based around wanting to help people, but it might ultimately not be the most helpful thing over the course of decades to do that.\\nCOWEN: But is it possible that’s actually, in a constrained sense, the very best outcome? People will still have a job. They’ll go somewhere in the morning. A lot of the work, especially the hard work, will be done by the AIs. Obviously, we’ll be richer, so we can afford this. All of a sudden, it won’t feel that bad to people. Life will look familiar. Isn’t that, in a sense, what we should be aiming for?\\nCLARK: I think we should be aiming for a —\\nCOWEN: In the same sense, you might need, say, a generous welfare state to have free trade. The welfare state isn’t always the most efficient, but if people accept freer trade, it’s an okay bargain. Isn’t this, in a sense, the welfare state for the service workers? And they still get to go somewhere in the morning if they want to, but they don’t have to.\\nCLARK: I believe that all people, have a desire for meaning and salience to what they do on a day-to-day basis. My worry with what you describe — it might not feel like it has sufficient meaning. I think that there is some giant class of activity that we want to continue happening in the world that people do and from which they draw meaning, but I don’t know that the best way to get there is to take some class of work and say this is work that we’re protecting and from which meaning will spring. Because I’m not confident that you’ll pick a load of jobs which naturally create their own meaning in that sense.\\nCOWEN: Hasn’t this succeeded in academia pre-AI? Most academic jobs are not that meaningful. The research people do — it’s not read by anyone. Maybe they’re decent teachers, but people take great pride in their research. They put a lot of effort into it. It’s meaningless. It seems we solved that problem already. We’re just going to take the academic model, but instead of it being research, bring it to, say, half of our current economy just to keep it going.\\nCLARK: Isn’t there a kind of angst and nihilism even within high-achieving parts of academia for this reason? Seems like when you speak to people, even very smart people who sometimes are doing the things you describe, they know they could be doing different things, and they are trapped into some kind of status game.\\nCOWEN: There’s some of that, but even the Nobel laureates — they’re rivalrous with each other. They can be very bitchy, very petty, but that’s just human nature, right? If the Nobel laureates aren’t happy, there’s no post-AI world that’s going to do much better than how we’re doing for the Nobel laureates today, right?\\nCLARK: Maybe my pushback is, I think that all of this could happen sufficiently quickly that we might have the opportunity to just play different higher-status games that are afforded to us via AI and the productive capacity it unlocks. There are definitely going to be entirely new jobs that involve marshaling and fielding AI systems for all kinds of work. I think there’ll be —\\nCOWEN: But those are hard jobs, right?\\nCLARK: Yes, but I think that there are going to be analogs which look more like creative, fun exercises in getting AIs to build things, or make things, or almost carry out competitions and games where people can play them with one another. And I think there’ll be entirely new forms of entertainment that has some amount of meaning, and perhaps an economic engine wired into it that people can participate in.\\nCOWEN: I believe we’re not that far from the age of what I call the AI teddy bears. You know what I mean when I say that?\\nCLARK: Yes.\\nCOWEN: What percentage of parents now will buy those teddy bears for their kids and allow it?\\nCLARK: I’ve had this thought since I have a person, that is my child, that’s almost two.\\nCOWEN: Sure.\\nCLARK: I am annoyed I can’t buy the teddy bear yet. I think most parents —\\nCOWEN: You’re an outlier [laughs].\\nCLARK: No. I don’t know. I don’t know.\\nCOWEN: You are cofounder of Anthropic, right?\\nCLARK: I don’t think I’m an outlier. I think that once your lovable child starts to speak and display endless curiosity and a need to be satiated, you first think, “How can I get them hanging out with other human children as quickly as possible?” So, we’re on the preschool list, all of that stuff.\\nI’ve had this thought, “Oh, I wish you could talk to your bunny occasionally so that the bunny would provide you some entertainment while I’m putting the dishes away, or making you dinner, or something.” Often, you just need another person to be there to help you wrangle the child and keep them interested. I think lots of parents would do this.\\nCOWEN: Say that the kid says to you, “Daddy, I prefer the bunny to my friends. Can I stay at home today?” Do you take the bunny away? That’s the tough part, right?\\nCLARK: I think that’s the part where you have them spend more time with their friends, but you keep the bunny in their life because the bunny is just going to get smarter and be more around them as they grow up. If you take it away, they’ll probably do something really strange with smart AI friends in the future.\\nNo, I don’t think I’m an outlier here. I think most parents, if they could acquire a well-meaning friend that could provide occasional entertainment to their child when their child is being very trying, they would probably do it [laughs].\\nCOWEN: I feel the word “occasional” is doing a lot of work in that sentence.\\nCLARK: [laughs]\\nCOWEN: If you can just ration how much your kid has the bunny, parents are going to love it, I agree. The same as with screens. A lot of children — they keep on wanting it. It’s hard to tell the child you can’t have it now. In the old days, it was watching television. “Oh, Mom, can I watch Star Trek again? Can I watch TV seven hours a day?” Well, that’s not good, and that’s hard to ration.\\nCLARK: Yes, so there’s some question here of how we portion this out. We do this today with TV, where if you’re traveling with us, like on a plane with us, or if you’re sick, you get to watch TV — the baby — and otherwise, you don’t, because from various perspectives, it seems like it’s not the most helpful thing. You’ll probably need to find a way to gate this. It could be, “When mom and dad are doing chores to help you, you get the thing. When they’re not doing chores, the thing goes away.”\\nCOWEN: Do you end up with too much surveillance over your kid? You’ll know everything if you want to, right? That might be a reason why you give the kid the bunny all the more.\\nCLARK: I think it comes down to frequency, which I mentioned, and also what you are and aren’t allowed to know. I find surveillance puzzling. We have one of these smart webcams that we got when the kids were early, so that you just see that they’re asleep. If they’re waking up, you work out if they’re okay or not. The main thing that that meant is that when the baby cries at night, sometimes we go in less than if we didn’t have the camera because if we didn’t have the camera, we’d have to go and check.\\nAs a consequence, my baby tends to sleep through the night a lot more because they don’t get occasionally interrupted. Sometimes they wake and cry for a minute and just go back to sleep. I think sometimes this stuff allows you to actually interfere less in a person’s life if you know certain things about it.\\nCOWEN: Say you have the hypothesis that so many seven-year-olds — they talk to themselves. They say weird things, and the AI bunny is going to report back to you, “Your kid says — “\\nCLARK: If the bunny says your kid is saying strange stuff —\\nCOWEN: But they all say strange stuff. I might have been chattering on about the New York Mets at age seven, and it would have been perfectly harmless, but it may not have sounded that way.\\nCLARK: You’re going to need to create spaces for unmonitored creativity in people. Actually, the same as how we have an approach to AI research today. Now, AI systems can output their chains of thought, which is the reasoning they use to come up with answers. We’ve had this question at Anthropic of how much should we monitor the chains of thought?\\nIf you actually monitor them, you might create an anti-goal where the system ends up wanting to have chains of thought which are safe to be monitored and which don’t cause demerits, which might actually break how it thinks in a bunch of ways. I think this analog applies here, where you’re going to need to choose how much you actually decide to know about people, or you risk creating incentives that change their behavior such that they have a negative effect.\\nCOWEN: You’ll go out on a date, and your date will say, “Please show me your AI report, what you’ve been talking to yourself about for the last three months.” You can not show it, which is a negative signal, or show it.\\n[laughter]\\nCOWEN: We all learn what other people are really like, and we just grow to accept that?\\nCLARK: Yes. Although, if the person asked you to do that on the first date, it’s fine. If they ask on a second date, you probably shouldn’t be dating that person.\\nCOWEN: Even during the swipe, the AI — you’re asked to upload it. The AI just reads the other AI report, and the person never sees it, and it tells you when you should swipe in the correct way.\\nCLARK: I don’t know. I don’t know if that’s so bad. I met my wife on OkCupid. I don’t know if you recall this. It was an online dating site where you would fill out a survey.\\nCOWEN: Of course. Match.com, for me, is where I met my wife.\\nCLARK: Exactly. Then I met her. Our non-AI but automated system had said, “You guys might get along.” So, we met each other that way. I don’t know that this is so different to previous things we’ve used.\\nCOWEN: But that’s information you’re putting in voluntarily as opposed to it watching you all the time.\\nCLARK: Yes. I just think that this is an area where we’re going to figure out the new norms of this technology and what seems appropriate and not appropriate. Some of that is just going to be solved through the logic of business, and other things through usage.\\nCOWEN: What will the economics of media look like? If you can read a digest of everything that is probably better than the original, or certainly not worse, or more synthetic. Who gets paid for what?\\nCLARK: I think that this is one of the toughest questions in front of us. As you know, I’m a former journalist. I grew up as a professional during the period when online ad market changes were altering the business model of journalism. They were switching from what you might think of as value that you derive through quality, through subscriptions or people buying your stuff to value that you derive from just large-scale attention because that became a lot of the model for funding this stuff.\\nAs a consequence, you saw the need to cross-subsidize journalists with journalists that got loads of eyeballs, and journalists like me, who would write about databases got less eyeballs. We were cross-subsidized by the people that wrote about Justin Bieber or what have you.\\nI think for media — it’s going to be really challenging to think through how the economics of this work. I think that it’ll change in a couple of ways. One, you might move to some of these larger-scale publishing house–style models for certain types of fictional universes which have subsidy and cross-subsidy within them.\\nCOWEN: Where does the cross-subsidy come from? Bloomberg — we know how that works. If AGI is truly general, and it’s based on what’s out there already, it should be able to do better than media on all dimensions.\\nCLARK: I think some things, you want to have come from a person for reasons that are based on the fact that we’re people. I think people will preferentially select the media which is fronted by other people, even if they’re making it using other means. I also think you want a kernel of humanity in a load of this stuff. Then there’ll be another type of media which is maybe attached to these subscription models, which is just on-tap permutations of anything and everything. So, there might be two markets that emerge.\\nCOWEN: Even the things we want to come from humans — say we want Ann Landers, the advice columnist, to come from an actual Ann Landers. The Ann Landers of the world — they’re using AIs, maybe surreptitiously, but the value of that is bid down because anyone can do that for the price of energy. So, we don’t really end up with this one part of the revenue-generating sector that can cross-subsidize the other parts. Just if intelligence is pretty cheap, that hits all of media.\\nCLARK: It hits all of media, and you will end up wanting to pay individuals. I think that happens even in the world we’re in today. People want to subsidize individual creators who may be using a whole bunch of this stuff.\\nCOWEN: It’s like Substack world.\\nCLARK: It’s Substack Patreon world for a large chunk of people, some of which will be incredibly successful. Then, I think, there’s also going to be universe world for certain universes which are very large and rich, which are being extended by AI systems.\\nCOWEN: You mean, like a Lord of the Rings universe.\\nCLARK: Yes, or Warhammer 40k, to show my nerd credentials.\\nCOWEN: They’ll publish fictional news, right?\\nCLARK: Yes.\\nCOWEN: Real news will come from Substack? Substack is not an obvious cross-subsidy. There might be within the Substack company.\\nCLARK: Real news — I genuinely don’t know. I think some real news comes from analysis of publicly available facts, and it being composed together in a way that shows you insights that didn’t exist. Semianalysis on Substack is a good example of this, a lot of public stuff leading to interesting conclusions. But news in the moment that has loads of context was subsidized by previous business models which mostly no longer work, and I genuinely don’t know what happens to it.\\nCOWEN: If we think about what we now call LLMs, five or ten years from now, that kind of AI — how concentrated or how competitive do you think the sector will be? I don’t know if number of firms is exactly the right measure, but how do you see it evolving? Right now, there’s at least six firms. Depending how you count China, there are some complications, but there’s a bunch of firms, a lot of competition.\\nCLARK: I would expect that there will be, for quite some time — many, many years — areas where there are slightly different specialisms on all of these things. They’ll be concentric circles that have got massively large in terms of the space that they cover, and they’ll have edges which are slightly differentiated. But in those edges will be where the frontier of certain types of human value stacks on top of AI value to lead to people choosing one or the other.\\nCOWEN: Claude is more poetic, for instance.\\nCLARK: A bad example due to the economics of poetry aren’t particularly great. Coding might be a better example. Or there could be cases for things like certain types of scientific experimentation where, actually, taste might come to matter a lot for composing experiments.\\nI expect we enter a world where you have a single digit number of these very, very large-scale models which are servicing a much larger set of wrappers on top of them that change the form factor by which they get integrated into your life, and which have a load of helper functions or knowledge, probably built by those AIs in partnership with some kind of other specialized AI system, or expert knowledge from that domain to chain it in.\\nCOWEN: Here’s a worry I have. My former colleague, Vernon Smith, once wrote a paper on this. He argued that, as you approach six competitors or more, a sector essentially behaves like perfect competition, even if it’s not exactly perfectly competitive. If that’s the case, how is it that AI, or indeed, any other companies, can behave ethically above and beyond what they need to do to stay in the market and earn profit? What room is there to be better than the next company?\\nCLARK: I think right now, it’s like we’re car companies, and we are mostly selling cars to teenagers who say, “How fast is it? And can I get it in red?” We’re beginning to find customers that are businesses that operate fleets of cars and say, “What seat belts does it have? What is your accident rate? What are all of these other properties?” The teenager has never asked us about, but these businesses do because it ties to their business model, or to liability, or to other things.\\nI think, therefore, there are technologies to be built that look like the safety equivalents that we have in cars or other things, which will change the logic of competition. We’re in competition right now. That competition will change as we unlock different markets that have different properties that they need to be present in the AI system. Those properties will often ladder up to certain types of safety technology.\\nCOWEN: So, the price of insurance is carrying the mechanism, so to speak?\\nCLARK: I believe that this will be one of the ways that it helps, yes.\\nCOWEN: How do we need to change or improve liability law for the price of insurance to actually carry that? Because right now, liabilities from AI of all sorts. It’s highly unclear.\\nCLARK: I have thought less about liability and more about information that should be made available by the companies, but I think these have an interplay where, today, there isn’t really a common labeling or disclosure standard about what are in these AI systems or the industrial practices you’ve used when making them.\\nI think that this is ultimately an area where you can do interventions to get some common level of transparency. That’ll interplay with both liability and also things like negligence, which will change the behavior of these companies over time. There’s some level of common information we can start providing about these systems, which will also change corporate behavior.\\nCOWEN: The information part worries me, though. I’m more inclined to be an accelerationist and hope the benefits outrace the costs, which I definitely think they will. But information only picks up the private value, so the social cost to the decision you make. The information doesn’t change what you do very much. People know a lot about global warming. Some people eat less meat, but for the most part, they don’t, right?\\nCLARK: Well, one of the things that you do is, you create information which becomes truly common. The economic index work we’ve done is from one single firm, but ultimately, you might want to generalize that to all firms, but then link it to large-scale data gathering that governments might do. I think if that became the case, you would have a higher chance of tying it to actual policy responses that would be larger in scope.\\nI also think, on climate change, just by measuring things like parts per million — stuff like that has helped catalyze large-scale amounts of capital to get re-mobilized around the economy in different areas to deal with this perceived negative impact that that has.\\nCOWEN: Do you agree with my view that we will not have meaningful international agreements on the hard parts of AI? Maybe on the simple parts.\\nCLARK: Ninety percent agreement. I think there is a chance of something that looks like a nonproliferation agreement between states, including the US and China in the limit.\\nCOWEN: The US and China enforce it, and we become vaguely allied with them in this one crusade?\\nCLARK: It might be deciding that certain things, certain capabilities of AI systems might be so potentially destabilizing that you don’t want them broadly available while recognizing that each government may be privately developing them. But you might have some common standard for what’s available to everyone, where you’ve decided, ooh, this would lead to just all kinds of chaos in our countries as well as in other countries.\\nCOWEN: And it would be enforced by the UN or by America? Or just international norms, sanctions?\\nCLARK: My assumption is a lot of this gets enforced by checking and then throwing policy punches at each other on things like tariffs or exports or other issues. I don’t know that there’re global governance bodies that will be formed. Some people feel optimistic about stuff like IAEA-style models for this, but I think things that require mutual inspection regimes end up being very, very hard to do under certain rivalrous dynamics.\\nCOWEN: I worry we’re in a world where NAFTA has not stuck, and NAFTA is one of the easiest agreements.\\nCLARK: NAFTA should have been easy.\\nCOWEN: It should have been easy, and it’s not, to say the least.\\nCOWEN: Say 10 years out, what’s your best estimate of the economic growth rate in the United States?\\nCLARK: The economic growth rate now is on the order of 1 percent to 2 percent.\\nCOWEN: There’s a chance at the moment, we’re entering a recession, but at average, 2.2 percent, so let’s say it’s 2.2.\\nCLARK: I think my bear case on all of this is 3 percent, and my bull case is something like 5 percent. I think that you probably hear higher numbers from lots of other people.\\nCOWEN: 20 and 30, I hear all the time. To me, it’s absurd.\\nCLARK: The reason that my numbers are more conservative is, I think that we will enter into a world where there will be an incredibly fast-moving, high-growth part of the economy, but it is a relatively small part of the economy. It may be growing its share over time, but it’s growing from a small base. Then there are large parts of the economy, like healthcare or other things, which are naturally slow-moving, and may be slow in adoption of this.\\nI think that the things that would make me wrong are if AI systems could meaningfully unlock productive capacity in the physical world at a really surprisingly high compounding growth rate, automating and building factories and things like this.\\nEven then, I’m skeptical because every time the AI community has tried to cross the chasm from the digital world to the real world, they’ve run into 10,000 problems that they thought were paper cuts but, in sum, add up to you losing all the blood in your body. I think we’ve seen this with self-driving cars, where very, very promising growth rate, and then an incredibly grinding slow pace at getting it to scale.\\nI’m skeptical because every time the AI community has tried to cross the chasm from the digital world to the real world, they’ve run into 10,000 problems that they thought were paper cuts but, in sum, add up to you losing all the blood in your body. I think we’ve seen this with self-driving cars, where very, very promising growth rate, and then an incredibly grinding slow pace at getting it to scale.\\nI just read a paper two days ago about trying to train human-like hands on industrial robots. Using reinforcement learning doesn’t work. The best they had was a 60 percent success rate. If I have my baby, and I give her a robot butler that has a 60 percent accuracy rate at holding things, including the baby, I’m not buying the butler. Or my wife is incredibly unhappy that I bought it and makes me send it back.\\nAs a community, we tend to underestimate that. I may be proved to be an unrealistic pessimist here. I think that’s what many of my colleagues would say, but I think we overestimate the ease with which we get into a physical world.\\nCOWEN: As I said in print, my best estimate is, we get half a percentage point of growth a year. Five percent would be my upper bound. What’s your scenario where there’s no growth improvement? If it’s not yours, say there’s a smart person somewhere in Anthropic — you don’t agree with them, but what would they say?\\nCLARK: I think one is something that you touched on earlier, where we could get the politics of this really wrong, and the technology could just get put in a relatively small box that does some economic good somewhere, but at a very, very small constrained amount. That’s the nuclear-power-failure-mode story, where we do some kind of large-scale regulatory scheme. We make it hard to do this stuff, and it ceases to have much of an effect. Maybe it has an effect elsewhere.\\nThe other case I’d give would be . . . It’s very hard for me to give a 0 percent case because we know today it’s incredibly useful for coding. If you just stopped all of it today, all further progress, I think the coding use case alone is going to be incredibly useful because it grows the ability to digitize parts of the economy, which we know drives faster loops in different parts of the economy, but generates value.\\nI think 0 percent is basically sub-1 percent chance of happening. If it did, it would be a Luddite thing, or something that looked like war with Taiwan, leading to everything else looking different as well.\\nCOWEN: In the 5 percent scenario — put aside San Francisco, which is special — but do cities become more or less important? Clearly, this city might become more important. Say, Chicago, Atlanta, what happens?\\nCLARK: I think that dense agglomerations of humans have significant amounts of value. I would expect that a lot of the effects of AI are going to be, for a while, massively increasing the superstar effect in different industries. I don’t know if it’s all cities, but I think any city which has something like a specialism — like high-frequency trading in Chicago or certain types of finance in New York — will continue to see some dividend from sets of professionals that gather together in dense quantities to swap ideas.\\nCOWEN: Could it just be easier to stay at home, and more fun? I find I’m an outlier, but my use of AI — I either want to go somewhere very distant and use the AI there to learn about, say, the birds of a region, or I want to stay at home. It’s a barbell effect. The idea of driving 35 minutes to Washington, DC — that seems less appealing than it used to be.\\nCLARK: Maybe I just have a different personality, or maybe it’s that I work in a really, really confusing domain, and I need to go and talk to other people who work in the confusing domain to get remotely oriented.\\nI also think that people are more . . . their revealed preference from stuff like COVID is that they have a greater desire for certain types of social things that they may have thought, and now they’re bouncing back to it, but it’s going to interplay slightly differently with cities.\\nCOWEN: If so much of labor and capital is going to be revalued, is quality land the best investment? Because I don’t know which firms will benefit the most. You might bet on AI firms — sure, that’s kind of easy, though it’ll be priced in. But the other firms, who knows? So, buy land in Los Angeles, say.\\nCLARK: I think that electricity and the production of electricity is going to be of tremendous value.\\nCOWEN: What’s the thing you would buy?\\nCLARK: I think you buy components that go into things like gas turbines and other things which are the base of the technology tree for generating electricity, of which you know people are going to want to do lots of. You could buy a basket of different components here. I would expect that to be of durable, meaningful value.\\nCOWEN: Let’s say it’s 10 years from now. GPUs are their successor. They’re not that scarce. There’s a lot of idle capacity just sitting around, and let’s say it’s very cheap. What do you have it do in its spare time?\\nCLARK: Ooh, that’s fun. I think one of the things is you might just pay AI systems by giving them access to compute. You could imagine some kind of barter economy. Now, for a range of bone-chilling safety problems with what I just said, but let’s put that aside and assume that those are mostly dealt with. I think there’ll be some form of trade with powerful AI systems or agents that work\"}\n",

The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.\\nIn some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.\\nTEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT\\nHow the microrobot works\\nRobeauté’s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.\\nInside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson’s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.\\nWhat is really impressive is how the robot’s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot’s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.\\nAI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS\\nLooking ahead: Trials and future plans\\nSo far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeauté plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.\\nAI SYSTEM RESTORES SPEECH FOR PARALYZED PATIENTS USING OWN VOICE\\nWhy this technology matters\\nThe potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.\\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\\nKurt\\'s key takeaways\\nRobeauté’s microrobot represents an exciting fusion of robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and medicine. It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company’s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within. With strong funding and a growing portfolio of patents, Robeauté is poised to make a lasting impact on the future of neurosurgery.\\nWould you trust a rice-sized robot to perform brain surgery on you safely?

Mr Altman signalled a willingness to work with Mr Musk, saying human-level artificial intelligence (AI), popularly referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), was much more \\'important\\' than their feud.\\nOn Saturday (May 10), Mr Musk reacted to a post from almost a decade ago where Mr Altman claimed that he would never vote for Donald Trump.

The transition from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA means paying taxes on the converted funds. But, with careful planning and strategic execution, it’s possible to minimize the tax impact.\\nGet matched with a financial advisor who can help you convert your retirement funds.\\nUnderstand the Basics of Roth IRA Conversions\\nWhen you convert funds from a traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA, you’re essentially converting pre-tax dollars to after-tax dollars. This conversion triggers a taxable event, meaning you’ll owe income tax on the amount converted. The key to minimizing taxes lies in understanding the timing and amount.\\nStrategy 1: Partial Conversions Over Several Years\\nInstead of moving the entire $865,000 in one year, consider spreading it across multiple years. This strategy helps to avoid pushing yourself into a higher tax bracket. For example, if you’re currently in the 24% tax bracket, converting a large sum might push you into the 32% or 35% tax bracket, significantly increasing your tax liability.\\nExample Strategy:\\nYear 1: Convert $200,000\\nYear 2: Convert $200,000\\nYear 3: Convert $200,000\\nYear 4: Convert $200,000\\nYear 5: Convert $65,000\\nBy spreading out the conversion, you keep your taxable income lower each year, potentially saving thousands in taxes.\\nKeep in mind, any amount you convert will typically be subject to the five-year rule, which means you can’t withdraw the converted amount without penalty for five years after you convert it.\\nA financial advisor can help you devise a personalized conversion strategy to minimize your conversion taxes. Talk to an advisor today.\\nStrategy 2: Leverage Lower Income Years\\nIf you anticipate a year with lower income — such as retirement or a sabbatical — that might be the ideal time to execute a conversion (though you may have to wait five years to use that income). During a lower income year, your overall taxable income will be less, which means the rollover amount will be taxed at a lower rate.\\nExample Scenario: If you retire at 62 and plan to start taking Social Security at 67, the years between 62 and 67 might be prime for Roth conversions. With no employment income and delayed Social Security, your taxable income is lower, allowing for a more tax-efficient rollover.\\nStrategy 3: Utilize Tax Deductions and Credits\\nTake advantage of available tax deductions and credits to offset the tax liability of your rollover. Charitable contributions, medical expenses and business losses are examples of deductions that can lower your taxable income.\\n-\\nA few years ago, you couldn’t even glance sideways at a media source without mention of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks. While some of the shine has come off the group as of recently, they are still among the best stocks to watch on the market today due to their oversized market capitalizations. Keep in mind, while many have experienced some volatility in 2025, they remain some of the largest and most influential companies in the market.\\nLearn More: How To Get a 10% Return on Investment (ROI): 10 Proven Ways\\nConsider This: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing\\nYou could easily buy stock in all these companies in one fell swoop by investing in funds like the Vanguard Growth EFT. However, if you’re looking to cash in by owning stock in one of the seven, and are trying to decide between investing in like Alphabet Inc. (Google’s parent company) or Meta Platforms Inc. (the owner of Facebook and Instagram), here are some things that may sway your decision.\\nIs Alphabet Stock or Meta Stock a Better Buy?\\nTech behemoths Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are technically fairly similar: both businesses rule their respective industries by making excellent products, both initiated dividends for the first time this year and both make a killing generating enormous amounts of revenue through digital advertising.\\nWhen dissecting two companies of this size, it’s easy to sit on the fence. If you believe in the potential of the metaverse and are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher rewards, Meta might be the better choice. If you prefer a more diversified company with steady revenue from various sources, Alphabet could be a more stable investment.\\nHowever, while both companies have vast growth potential and are poised to continue to change the world as we know it from a technological perspective, they differ in the details. Evaluating the direction in which each company may move in the future, many dictate where you want to place your hard-earned.\\nTrading in internet search engines, cloud infrastructure, entertainment, media, advertising, consumer electronics and mobile operating systems, Alphabet’s main sources of income are YouTube and Google, the world’s leaders in internet searching and online video content searching, respectively.\\nRandi Zuckerberg, former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister of Mark, feels her brother’s company is in a better position than Alphabet to take advantage of the forthcoming AI frontier. Providing the world with social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta Platform’s core earnings drivers are in advertising, the metaverse, consumer electronics and social media. Meta isn’t worth as much as Alphabet, but it’s still got a very well-lined purse.\\n-\\nA $350,000 account could be exhausted in just a few years if both members of a couple required semi-private rooms in skilled nursing facilities. However, that’s not necessarily what would happen. For one thing, most people don’t run up nursing home bills of that magnitude. Also, you may be able to get government assistance to pay nursing home costs while keeping your IRA intact. Long-term care insurance and other financial tools offer other ways to pay a nursing home without emptying your savings. If you are concerned about paying for long-term care, consider discussing it with a financial advisor.\\nPaying for Long-Term Care\\nLong-term care costs unquestionably are eye-catching. In 2021, the Genworth Financial Cost of Care Survey pegged the average daily cost of a semi-private room in a skilled nursing facility at over $94,000 per year. At that rate, if both members of a couple required a similar level of care, $350,000 in IRAs would only cover about two years’ worth of costs.\\nThat doesn’t mean your retirement account will meet a similar fate. According to the federal Administration on Aging, about 35% of people spend any time in a nursing home, and the average stay is about a year. People are more likely to use other types of long-term care, such as assisted living and in-home aides, that cost less.\\nThe government also steps in. Medicare, the national healthcare program available to most people over age 65, covers up to 100 days of nursing home care in most cases. If you need more time in long-term care, Medicaid, the federal-state healthcare program for people of limited financial means, will cover nursing home stays of indefinite length.\\nGet matched with up to three financial advisors for free to discuss your costs, risks and options in retirement.\\nBasic Medicaid Rules\\nYou must have very limited financial resources in order to qualify for Medicaid. States oversee the program and rules vary, but in some you can only have about $2,000 in assets other than your home. The income limits vary but are also strict.\\nSome states don’t include IRAs when determining Medicaid eligibility, so if you live in one of these your IRA is safe. However, most do include IRAs as assets and in these you may have to spend nearly all the money in your retirement fund before you Medicaid will pay for nursing home care.\\nMeeting Medicaid Eligibility Tests\\nIf you have too many assets, you may be able to satisfy Medicaid’s means test by gifting assets to a family member. However, you generally have to do this at least five years before you apply for Medicaid. If you don’t observe the five-year lookback period, Medicaid may include the transferred assets when determining your eligibility. If that happens, you may have to spend the money in your IRA to pay for nursing home costs until your assets decline enough to meet the Medicaid means test.\\n-\\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\\nWith $1 million in a 401(k) and no mortgage on a $500,000 home, retirement at 60 may, in fact, be possible. However, retiring before eligibility for Social Security and Medicare mean relying more on savings. So deciding to retire at 60 calls for careful planning around healthcare, taxes and more. At any age, deciding whether you can retire comes down to weighing your assets against your expenses.\\nDo you have questions about retirement planning? Speak with a financial advisor today.\\nRetirement Decision Basics\\nThe first step in deciding if you can retire at 60 is understanding your financial situation. Important factors include your assets like retirement accounts, other savings and home equity. Your expenses also matter, from basics like housing and food to discretionary costs for travel. Comparing your income sources to your costs reveals whether you need to adjust your savings rate or can retire comfortably.\\nIt’s also key to understand how retirement age affects your future income and expenses. For instance, you aren’t eligible for Social Security until age 62. Also, while you can technically claim benefits at 62, waiting until your full retirement age of 67 or even until 70, boosts your monthly benefit significantly.\\nRetirement age also can greatly affect healthcare costs. That’s because retiring before 65 means paying for five years of private health insurance until Medicare eligibility.\\nRetiring by 60\\nAmerican workers typically retire around ages 64-67. Retiring early at 60 requires diligent preparation, but isn’t impossible. First, understand the rules around retirement accounts.\\nWith a 401(k), you can take penalty-free withdrawals starting at age 55 if you leave your employer. However, you’ll still owe income tax on withdrawals. It’s wise to delay drawing down retirement savings as long as possible, so your investments keep growing.\\nSecond, realize you’ll need to self-fund healthcare until Medicare at 65. In turn, you’ll need to budget for five years of individual coverage or COBRA. If you have health issues, delaying retirement to keep work-based insurance may be safest.\\nThird, while you can claim Social Security at 62, your benefit will be permanently reduced versus waiting. If you delay until your full retirement age, your check will be approximately 30% higher. Waiting until 70 maximizes it even further to 132%. If you can afford to wait, many experts recommend doing so.\\nIf you have a mortgage, consider paying it off before retiring at 60. If you’ve paid off your home, that’s one less expense to worry about after you’re living on a fixed income, notes Alec F. Root, CFA and research analyst at DBR & CO.'}\n",

Professional judgment is critical. AI simply doesn't have anything close. Don't rely on AI for tax advice. \\nArtificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Grok are becoming household fixtures with Americans increasingly turning to them. These tools are being used to find answers on everything from cooking recipes to complicated tax questions. How reliable is AI for taxpayers seeking tax advice, particularly on U.S. international tax issues?\\nWhile AI has laudable capabilities and provides great speed in its responses, the reality is that currently in the U.S. international tax area (indeed, in the tax area generally), AI often delivers inaccurate or incomplete information. Since U.S. international taxation is such a highly specialized field, AI can leave users at risk of costly mistakes. For now, a thorough and proper tax analysis requires the expertise of a seasoned professional who can understand the interplay of the tax law, Treasury regulations, IRS notices and rulings, court cases, and international tax treaties.\\nAI Tax Advice: The Temptation and Limitations\\nThere is an undeniable appeal of AI in the complicated U.S. tax space that often overwhelms even tax professionals, let alone the lay person. With its speedy answers that are generated so easily and for free, the AI tool seems a godsend in the complicated tax world. For the more straightforward and typically domestic (as opposed to international) tax issues, these tools might be sufficient to point users in the right direction.\\nThe cracks in AI’s armor start to show when tackling U.S. international tax matters. This is not only because international tax is an area rife with complexity but also because it is highly dynamic. Aside from the technical aspects involved, U.S. international tax is shaped by frequent regulatory updates, IRS interpretations, and judicial decisions. AI struggles to keep pace.\\nTake for example, the proliferation of IRS Practice Units, many of which focus on international tax matters. Practice Units are internal IRS training materials for examiners. The IRS just started issuing these in 2020. As international tax issues are becoming more and more common in today’s global economy the IRS has had to be proactive training its agents to understand them and catch noncompliance.\\nThe Units are publicly available on IRS.gov but are not binding and cannot be used as precedent. From January to the first week of May 2025 the IRS has already issued 35 such Units. Of these, 22 cover complicated international tax topics such as “French Foreign Tax Credits”, “Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax”, “Foreign Tax Credit Computations”, “Foreign Tax Credit Limitations”, “General Deductions of a Foreign Corporation Engaged in U.S. Trade or Business (Non-Treaty)”, “Reduced Foreign Taxes Under Treaty Provisions” and many more subjects delving into technical international taxation. The Practice Unit resource is just one of many forms of tax guidance that is constantly evolving. The tax laws, regulations, treaties and updates may not be picked up by AI models resulting in incorrect or incomplete answers.\\nThe Risk of AI Inaccuracy\\nThe problem of AI’s questionable accuracy has its roots in how AI generates its responses. AI tools such as ChatGPT and Grok rely on so-called “large language models” trained on a huge and diverse amount of text that includes online forums, books, articles, websites and public records. This training results in an end-product that sounds like highly intelligent answers cloaked in perfect conversational text. Critically, this alone is not sufficient for a tax analysis, and it is all too easy to forget that AI cannot think independently. Professional judgement remains critical.\\nAI tools do not guarantee accuracy. This is particularly so in nuanced areas such as international tax which demands precise, up-to-date expertise. There’s the significant problem of “simplexity”. The tax law is highly complex. If AI presents the law as if it is simple, this can result in presenting the law as something different from what the law actually is, as has been encountered with the IRS chatbot “Interactive Tax Assistant”.\\nOther problems involve misinterpretation, relying on outdated sources, entirely missing out on important information, conflating similar but distinct international tax concepts (e.g., it might confuse the Foreign Tax Credit with the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion) and even “hallucinating”.\\nMy own experiences with an AI “hallucination” occurred recently. The first, when I asked whether there was an exception in the FBAR filing rules for non-U.S. accounts owned by a foreign government entity. I was examining whether Pope Leo XIV, a U.S. citizen, might have a possible FBAR obligation with regard to accounts at the Vatican Bank. AI incorrectly reported that such an exception existed (the exception applies only to foreign financial accounts of any governmental entity of the United States). Another incident occurred when I asked if the U.S. had negotiated totalization agreements with the countries of Ecuador or Costa Rica and received an (incorrect) answer in the affirmative. No such totalization agreements exist.\\nOther tax professionals testing AI have found incorrect answers, in one instance 100% of the time. Even though answers were on the right track, AI failed to catch the critical nuances, of which the U.S. tax laws are replete.\\nAny of these missteps could lead to incorrect answers or calculations, potentially triggering an IRS audit and penalties. The problem, especially for the layperson, is that the AI generated responses sound so good, that they are taken at face value.\\nAI Errors Have Real-World Consequences\\nGetting things wrong, especially in international tax compliance which remains a top IRS enforcement priority, can lead to serious consequences. Errors in reporting foreign income or assets involves stiff penalties. For example, there is a $10,000 penalty for an untimely FBAR or foreign information return such as Form 8938 or 5471; a 40% accuracy-related penalty on unpaid tax for errors involving foreign assets. Reliance on AI and AI chatbots will not suffice as “reasonable cause” to avoid imposition of IRS penalties.\\nLast year, the U.S. Taxpayer Advocate Service cited a Washington Post review finding that AI chatbots from leading tax return preparation companies gave inaccurate tax advice up to 50% of the time on complex tax questions. Beyond the significant financial costs that can result from inaccurate AI tax advice, taxpayers face the stress of audits and the burden of correcting mistakes.\\nWhy Human Tax Professionals Matter A Lot\\nCurrently, AI has serious shortcomings when it comes to U.S. international taxation. Experienced international tax professionals occupy an irreplaceable role and unlike algorithms, they specialize in deciphering the many nuances involved in international tax matters.\\nThe top professionals stay current on IRS guidance, monitor treaty updates, and analyze case law on a regular basis. They tailor tax advice to a client’s unique situation. Doing this often requires using professional judgment because a one-size-fits-all approach does not work in the international tax world. Tax professionals strategize and provide all-important context that can optimize the tax outcome for each particular case. AI has yet to master any of these skills; it has a long way to go.\\nThis isn’t to say AI has no place in the world of international tax planning. It can certainly be a useful time-saving tool and starting point for a general explanation of unfamiliar tax concepts. Relying on AI alone, however, is a gamble not worth taking. In time, as AI inevitably evolves, its accuracy and abilities will develop, but at the moment AI is not a substitute for a qualified tax professional.\\nStay on top of tax matters around the globe.\\nReach me at vljeker@us-taxes.org\\nVisit my U.S. tax blog www.us-tax.org\\nNO ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP OR LEGAL ADVICE\\nThis communication is for general informational purposes only.

And according to Robert Califf, who served as FDA commissioner between 2016 and 2017, the agency review teams have already been experimenting with AI for several years.\\n\"It will be interesting to hear the details of which parts of the review were \\'AI assisted\\' and what that means,\" Califf told Wired. \"There has always been a quest to shorten review times and a broad consensus that AI could help.\"\\nThe agency was considering using AI in other aspects of its operations, too.\\n\"Final reviews for approval are only one part of a much larger opportunity,\" Califf added.\\nMakary, who was appointed commissioner by president Donald Trump, has frequently expressed his enthusiasm for the technology.\\n\"Why does it take over ten years for a new drug to come to market?\" he tweeted on Wednesday. \"Why are we not modernized with AI and other things?\"\\nThe FDA news parallels a broader trend of AI adoption in federal agencies during the Trump administration. In March, OpenAI announced a version of its chatbot called ChatGPT Gov designed to be secure enough to process sensitive government information. Musk has pushed to fast-track the development of another AI chatbot for the US General Services Administration, while using the technology to try to rewrite the Social Security computer system.\\nYet, the risks of using the technology in a medical context are concerning, to say the least. Speaking to Wired, an ex-FDA staffer who has tested ChatGPT as a clinical tool pointed out the chatbot\\'s proclivity for making up convincing-sounding lies — a problem that won\\'t go away anytime soon.\\n\"Who knows how robust the platform will be for these reviewers\\' tasks,\" the former FDA employee told the magazine.\\nMore on medical AI: Nonverbal Neuralink Patient Is Using Brain Implant and Grok to Generate Replies\\nShare This Article'}\n",

      "async_langchain: 39, {'article': 'Page title: Waymo Cofounder Says Safety Is \\'Paramount\\' to Dominating Robotaxi Race - Business Insider\\nSocial card title: The visionary behind Waymo reveals what will make or break robotaxi companies\\nSocial card description: Sebastian Thrun, a pioneer of the self-driving industry, talked to BI about Waymo\\'s greatest strength and why he still hasn\\'t given up on flying cars.\\n- Sebastian Thrun is one of the leading pioneers of self-driving technology.\\n- He cofounded Waymo, which began as a \"moonshot\" project under Google X.\\n- Thrun spoke to BI about his thoughts on Waymo now and what he anticipates for the future.\\nSebastian Thrun, a pioneer in the self-driving industry, looks at Waymo like a proud dad.\\nNearly 20 years ago, Thrun and his team at Stanford University made a pivotal leap in autonomous driving after their retrofitted Volkswagen completed a 132-mile course in the Nevada desert.\\nThere was no human behind the wheel.\\nThe feat captured the attention of Google cofounder Larry Page. The then-CEO called Thrun and convinced him to head Google\\'s self-driving project, which would be part of Google X, the company\\'s research and development arm. There, some of the smartest and brightest pursued \"moonshot\" projects.\\nSince then, Thrun has watched autonomous cars grow from an experiment to a real-world business.\\nThe Google project was rebranded Waymo in 2016, two years after Thrun had already left the search engine company to start up a tech school. Thrun also headed the now-defunct Kittyhawk, a flying car project backed by Page.\\nThrun spoke to BI about Waymo\\'s early aspirations, what it will take to dominate in the race to autonomy, and why he still hasn\\'t let go of his flying car ambitions.\\nA spokesperson for Waymo declined to provide a comment.\\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\nWhen you jump-started what was once just a \"moonshot\" project inside Google X, what was the vision you had for the Google self-driving project, and does Waymo live up to or exceed your expectations?\\nOh, it lives up to my exact expectations. We wanted to make cars safer with self-driving technology and build a business in which cars are used better than they are today, AKA a ride-sharing business.\\nOn the timeline side, it proved to be a hard nut to crack because the tolerance to errors is extremely low.\\nFor example, compare this with recent advances in large language models and chatbots. When a large language model hallucinates, we scratch our heads and are not happy, but no one dies.\\nWhen a self-driving car hallucinates, it might kill somebody or run a red light.\\nWhat did you imagine Waymo\\'s business model would look like at the time?\\nWhen I was running the team, we had business aspirations, but we had not worked out practical things like go-to-market strategies. And our aspiration was really to be the number one ride-sharing, ride-hailing taxi company in the world. But 99.9% of my time was dedicated to making the technology work. And remember, this was 10 years ago.\\nDo you think Waymo made the right decision by going city-by-city to get these highly detailed maps before it deploys a robotaxi service to the public?\\nI believe that safety is paramount. The data suggests pretty clearly that Waymo is taking the right course here. Not only have the cars been remarkably safe — as you know, a recent study by Swiss Re showed that they\\'re safer than human drivers — but I also think Waymo has been able to build the trust of the public necessary to operate.\\nDo you think scaling autonomy is fundamentally a software problem that could be solved with more data, similar to AI models? Or do you think autonomy will always be bound by geographic limitations or infrastructure?\\nNo, I firmly believe that at some point, the technology will be good enough that you can forgo the necessity to build maps.\\nBut I also want to point out that building maps is not an expensive step. It\\'s a bit of a side product of testing. We look at the number of miles that Waymo has been tested. It\\'s now in the tens of millions. If you apply this to the United States, that\\'s like mapping the United States over and over and over again. It\\'s not an expensive factor.\\nI\\'m pretty convinced that the technology is good enough even to drive without maps, but it\\'s just such a good thing to have — an advanced knowledge of where to expect certain things. And remember, the map changes all the time. There are construction zones and routing changes, so it\\'s not a constant thing. The vehicles are constantly remapping the environment.\\nSo, do you envision a future where Waymo will increasingly have to rely less on these detailed maps or maybe even fewer sensors?\\nI can\\'t really speak for the current team here, because I\\'ve not been with them for a decade.\\nOne of my observations is that, just looking at the field as a whole, the cost of sensors has gone down dramatically.\\nRight now, I\\'d say the cost of lidar relative to IRAD (Internal Research and Development costs) is roughly down by a factor of 50. So, to the extent that the sensing argument is a cost argument, I think that as these cars will be produced in larger numbers, that argument will go away.\\nThen it comes to safety. My firm belief is that we should have any piece of software or equipment, including sensing equipment, that can be demonstrated to enhance safety. We are very tolerant of the lack of safety in human driving and tolerate more than a million deaths every year worldwide, which is a significant number. But I don\\'t think we should have the same tolerance for robotic systems. We should have a higher standard, and the higher standard will lead to fewer funerals.\\nJohn Krafcik, the former Waymo CEO, told me that when we talk about sensor costs, the cost argument is trivial. He believes that there are \"quantifiable\" benefits to safety.\\nYou\\'ve tested it, trusted your life into it, and can see the reception now in San Francisco, which is really widely positive. It\\'s become an icon in the tourism industry. You come to San Francisco to try it out.\\nAll these things are possible because of the radical focus on safety. Everything is speculation, but I think it\\'s such an important cornerstone that this technology is accepted and that we feel it defines a completely new level of safety and transportation.\\nIn that case, what do you think of Tesla\\'s proposition: A generalized AI driver? No high-definition maps. No lidar. End-to-end AI driving.\\nLook, I cannot comment on Tesla. I don\\'t know the details of the technology. I can only tell you what my ethos was when I built up the early version of Waymo. Our ethos was that safety is so paramount.\\nI can tell you, positively, that if you took Waymo and ripped out all the radars and lasers, that would make the car less safe. I can say that with confidence, even though I\\'m not part of the current team.\\nThe laser and the radar provide a layer of environment understanding that is succinctly different from a camera. They\\'ll pick up objects just by virtue of being there, even if they\\'re unknown to the machine learning system. I know from the team that they\\'re obviously getting better and better with a subset of sensors.\\nCan I ask like this then? What do you think will determine the \"winner\" of the robotaxi race? Is it the company that proves to be the safest, or is it one that will scale quicker first?\\nThere are a number of elements. I would say safety is paramount.\\nThe two remaining variables are cost and scale. They are intertwined, but they are not the same.\\nOn the cost side, a self-driving car ultimately has to be cheaper than a human-driven car or comparable. I believe that cost is an important factor in transportation for the vast majority of people in the world.\\nAnd then scale is obvious, and scale is hard. It\\'s an enormous undertaking. If you look at the details of what this really entails, there\\'s capital, there\\'s maintenance, and there\\'s even manufacturing. So I think that now that we have the proof-of-concept, and it\\'s a working, very accepted and safe taxi system in four — and soon five cities — I\\'m sure that, and I\\'m not part of the leadership team at Waymo anymore, but I\\'m sure that, at Waymo, people are now thinking about how to scale it up.\\nIs there anything you think Waymo should be betting on or doubling down on right now?\\nWell, I\\'m a long-term fan of an even more radical proposal, which is flying cars.\\nWould I recommend that Waymo drop everything they do and start working on flying cars? No, I would not. But I can tell you the way flying cars are today is exactly the same way self-driving cars were 10 years ago. Ten years ago, when I left, we had prototypes in hand that were able to drive hundreds of thousands of miles without what we call \"critical interventions,\" where the driver had to take over — although with the caveat that this was mostly highway driving at the time.\\nBut it was nowhere near a level of safety that would allow us to operate a commercial business. And obviously, between that time and today, new laws and regulations came into effect, putting a formal pathway in place that would\\'ve retroactively prohibited us from building a commercial service 10 years ago when I left.\\nThe flying car situation is more nascent. There are now prototypes of electrically-propelled vehicles that can take off like helicopters. They\\'re super quiet and can fly for about a hundred miles, give or take.\\nBut we are far from regulatory clarity. Aviation is regulated federally, not statewide, and has a very high bar that you have to meet to even be airworthy. No one has yet met that bar. This is more of a research and development project than a practical project.\\nDo you envision a future in which people are less inclined to drive?\\nLook, my prediction is going to be — and I can\\'t tell you what the timetable is — there will be cities that will realize that this technology is radically safer and radically greener. Every city in the world is full of parked cars, and we don\\'t think about this, but it\\'s quite a burden on the city. A friend of mine once calculated that about 60% of the land mass in Los Angeles is dedicated to cars when you count things like garages and driveways. So more than half.\\nThere will be cities that say, \"Look, we are ready to make our downtown area a parked-car-free area.\"\\nWe\\'ll still have car-based transportation. But we\\'re going to make it greener. You want to make it safer and more pleasant for people. And we\\'re going to do it in a downtown area with lots of young people who don\\'t want to own a car to begin with. Or maybe university cities will do this.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nI think we\\'re going to see this in the next few years, somewhere in the world, where cities will say that\\'s the right time. And what this really means is: For this to be true, it has to be the case that the car will become lower in cost than car ownership. At least that\\'s my belief. Because then you can even make an economical argument to people and say, \"Look, you can own a car, but this thing, I mean, it\\'s cheaper.\" And you save money on top of it. It\\'s greener, it\\'s safer, and cheaper. How would cities not want to do this at some point?\\nBut look at New York, for example. It has congestion pricing right now. If you switch to self-driving cars, the very first thing you do away with is traffic lights. You don\\'t need them anymore because cars can communicate.\\nYour capacity will also increase. If self-driving cars are allowed on a highway, you could easily reduce the spacing between cars by a factor of two, which would double the capacity of the highway.\\nAnything you would be doing differently if you were behind the wheel at Waymo?\\nI\\'m the biggest fan. I open my door every morning and see two or three Waymos zipping by my house, and I couldn\\'t be prouder.\\nI\\'m really very, very proud. The leadership has done an amazing job navigating and has really earned the public\\'s trust, which I think is so important for technological innovations.'}\n",

This farmer is betting on it | CBC News\\nSocial card title: This lettuce is grown with AI. Some believe it\\'s the future of Canadian produce | CBC News\\nSocial card description: A farmer and entrepreneur in King City, Ont., is making a pitch to help Canada become less sufficient on vegetable imports; a fully automated greenhouse, controlled by AI.\\nCan machine-grown lettuce help cut Canada\\'s reliance on U.S. greens? This farmer is betting on it\\nIn 2024, 92 per cent of Canadian lettuce was imported from the U.S.\\nAs Canada\\'s reliance on U.S. produce hits the spotlight, one Ontario farmer has a pitch: locally grown, year-round produce, grown by artificial intelligence and automation.\\nIn a sprawling two-hectare greenhouse, partially tucked inside a wooden red barn in King City, Ont., an animated Jay Willmot, farmer and entrepreneur, shared his vision.\\n\"From sowing and seeding, all the way through to harvest and packing, no one touches this crop,\" he said in front of rows and rows of lettuce shoots.\\nInstead, multimillion-dollar AI and machinery does the work; the whirring and clicking of conveyor belts, hooks and levers, fills the space that was once part of his family\\'s horse farm.\\nWillmot built his business, Haven Greens, to tackle the Canadian winter and a laundry list of obstacles that farmers face — from high labour costs to unpredictable weather. He\\'s not alone; federal and provincial governments have offered incentives to encourage automation.\\nSome experts do urge caution though — saying widespread adoption could have unintended consequences.\\nLettuce close to home\\nEven without AI, a traditional greenhouse, or a vertical farm, would have addressed the issue of year-round growth. It\\'s a route many are choosing to take; Canadian greenhouse lettuce production alone has quadrupled over the last decade, according to Statistics Canada.\\nWillmot said automation and artificial intelligence allows him to maximize the amount of lettuce he can grow, while cutting labour costs, typically a greenhouse grower\\'s biggest operating expense.\\nThe company also uses solar power, rainwater and other \"energy-efficient systems\" to keep costs down, he said. And he says the AI cuts out a lot of the waste that comes with guesswork.\\n\"We have sensors that measure temperature, light intensity, humidity levels, and pressure levels. Everything within this greenhouse is automated by that central computer to achieve optimal growth conditions.\" he added.\\nThe company says the greenhouse produces more than 4,000 kilograms of lettuce per day. It\\'s being sold through the Ontario food terminal and directly to a number of independent grocery stores.\\nFor Willmot, the goal is a reliable product that doesn\\'t need to travel across a continent to hit store shelves.\\n\"I was sick and tired of old, slimy, smelly lettuce,\" he said. When California, where most of Ontario\\'s lettuce comes from, was hit by drought and disease in 2022, lettuce prices hit a record high.\\n\"We need this all across the country so that we can build these local food systems that have inherent food sovereignty within them, that fight food insecurity, that can feed our local communities,\" he argued.\\nEven with the \"tens of millions of dollars\" in start-up costs for the custom machinery and AI tech, Willmot calculates he can turn a profit on this model, while keeping the retail price \"competitive.\"\\nLess reliance on farm labour\\nIt\\'s a business case provincial and federal governments are counting on.\\nEven before trade tensions pushed Canada\\'s dependence on U.S. produce back into the spotlight, there was a push to incentivize agricultural technology, to make Canada more self-sufficient.\\nIn Ontario, for example, the government dished out $547,720 in 2021 to Great Lakes Greenhouses Inc, an operation in the heart of Leamington, Ont. — dubbed North America\\'s greenhouse capital for having the highest density of greenhouses on the continent. The cash was to help the company pilot an artificial intelligence system that would \"allow greenhouse operators to remotely grow cucumbers and eggplant crops, reducing in-person contact,\" a provincial press release reads.\\nB.C. also has an On-Farm Technology Adoption Program, offering cost-sharing funding for labour-saving tech like autonomous weeders, harvesters and sorters.\\nThe country is heavily reliant on temporary foreign workers for farm labour. Nearly half of the people working in Canada\\'s agriculture sector were employed on a seasonal basis in 2022, according to Statistics Canada. It is a gap that Willmot believes automation can fill.\\nBut Canada\\'s Research Chair in Science and Society, Kelly Bronson says, the impact on migrant workers need to be considered carefully.\\n\"There\\'s all sorts of ethical issues presented by that labour supply solution in that these workers tend to be very precariously paid, precariously employed in terms of having no legal infrastructure to support them,\" said Bronson, who has done research consulting migrant farmers.\\n\"Many of them really depend on this income. We have to think about the consequences of displacing already the most marginalized actors.\"\\nWillmot, however, believes Canada\\'s reliance on foreign workers is part of the problem.\\n\"For us, we really like supporting people that are here,\" he said. \"I\\'ll take giving local people that live in our own backyard good-paying jobs 10 out 10 times.\" The company says it has hired 35 full-time staff.\\nA call for a closer look\\nBronson, who has specifically studied the growth and impact of agricultural technology, acknowledges the excitement around food sovereignty amidst a \"geopolitical tariff warfare.\"\\nBut she urges caution — even with the company\\'s solar PV\\'s, rainwater usage, recaptured emissions, and wider net-zero promise.\\n\"If you think about the energy costs of sustaining an indoor farming environment, they\\'re pretty huge. And even if you take a fuller view of AI, we know now the environmental costs in terms of data storage, the energy costs, the impact on climate in terms of data, storage facilities.\"\\nShe calls for detailed, independent research into the use and impact of the automation and AI model in Canada\\'s food systems, to test the claims its proponents make.\\nCambridge University researchers have also warned about potential risks from rapid deployment of AI in agriculture, in a 2022 Nature Machine Intelligence paper, including accidental failure and unintended consequences.\\n\"I think it is the future,\" said Rozita Dara, director of the Artificial Intelligence for Food initiative at the University of Guelph. But she too urges the sector, and governments, to think about who can benefit from this often costly, technology.\\n\"We have to keep smaller businesses in mind because we want them to operate and thrive in this situation.\"\\nBack in King City, Willmot is confident in his vision. The third-generation farmer, and lawyer, is keenly aware that Canada\\'s farmers are aging out, and the new generation isn\\'t keen to take up the mantle. By 2033, 40 per cent of Canadian farm operators are expected to retire, and Statistics Canada numbers find that 66 per cent don\\'t have a succession plan.\\nWe want \"to show young people there\\'s exciting stuff happening in agriculture. And we need more people to come in and grow food for Canada,\" he pitched.'}\n",

I believe in forgiveness and a God who forgives. I still do.”\\nIt was the first time the AI avatar of a victim—in this case, a dead man—has ever addressed a court, and it raises many questions about the use of this type of technology in future court proceedings.\\nThe avatar was made by Pelkey’s sister, Stacey Wales. Wales tells 404 Media that her husband, Pelkey’s brother-in-law, recoiled when she told him about the idea. “He told me, ‘Stacey, you’re asking a lot.’”\\nGabriel Horcasitas killed Christopher Pelkey in 2021 during a road rage incident. Horcasitas was found guilty in March and faced a sentencing hearing earlier this month. As part of the sentencing, Pelkey’s friends and family filed statements about how his death affected them. In a first, the Arizona court accepted an AI-generated video statement in which an avatar made to look and sound like Pelkey spoke.\\n“Hello, just to be clear for everyone seeing this, I am a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile,” the stilted avatar says. “I was able to be digitally regenerated to share with you today. Here is insight into who I actually was in real life.”\\nThe video then changes to a real video of Pelkey filmed while he was alive, where he talks about his time in the Army and his belief in God. The video goes back to the AI avatar. “I would like to make my own impact statement,” the avatar says. “I can’t tell you how humbled I am for those that spoke up for me, everyone who flew in, took off from work, and for everyone who has supported me and my loved ones through three-and-a-half years and two trials, I wish I could be with you all today.” That’s when the AI avatar directly addressed Horcasitas.\\n“To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,” the AI Pelkey says. “In another life we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness, in God who forgives, I always have. And I still do.”\\nNotably, the judge in the case, Todd Lang, said he was moved by the video.\\n“I loved that AI, and thank you for that. As angry as you are, and as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness, and I know Mr. Horcasitas could appreciate it, but so did I,” Lang said immediately before sentencing Horcasitas. “I love the beauty in what Christopher, and I call him Christopher—I always call people by their last names, it’s a formality of the court—but I feel like calling him Christopher as we’ve gotten to know him today. I feel that that was genuine, because obviously the forgiveness of Mr. Horcasitas reflects the character I heard about today. But it also says something about the family, because you told me how angry you were, and you demanded the maximum sentence. And even though that’s what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it. I didn’t hear him asking for the maximum sentence.”\\nHorcasitas’s lawyer also referenced the avatar when asking Lang for mercy: “As you heard the likeness of Mr. Pelkey say, they could have been friends,” the lawyer said. “And I will tell you, having known Mr. Horcasitas for about three and a half years and reviewing various content of Mr. Pelkey’s phone, I think they had a lot of similar interests, and I think Mr. Pelkey was right, they could have been friends.”\\nWales told 404 Media that she struggled writing her own victim impact statement for months before landing on the idea of using AI to have him give his own. She and her husband—Tim Wales—both work in tech and Tim has used AI tools before.\\n“We talked about it and he says, ‘You know you have to be careful with this stuff. In the wrong hands it can send the wrong message,’” Stacey told 404 Media. “He says, ‘Because without the right script, this will fall short. It will be flat and hokey and I’m not going to let it go out if it’s not authentic.’”\\nStacey said she believes she knew what Christopher would say. “I…know the power of something like this. It needs to be a blanket statement of love, because that’s what Chris would stand for,” she said. “I can't use it selfishly, and I'm already aware of that.”\\nAccording to Stacey, Tim used Stable Diffusion fine-tuned with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to craft the video. “And then we used a generative AI and deep learning processes to create a voice clone from his original voice,” she said.\\nUsing an AI generated video to have a dead victim deliver “their own” impact statement is unprecedented. AI avatars are obviously not the real person, and what they say must either be scripted by a different person, or generated using an LLM that is not the person. In this case, the video was used to help determine the prison sentence of a living person. The video that Pelkey’s family played contained several minutes of video of Pelkey from when he was alive, but everything the AI avatar said was scripted by his sister.\\nThere were videos shown during the trial that Stacey said were deeply difficult to sit through. “Videos of Chris literally being blown away with a bullet through his chest, going in the street, falling backward. We saw these items over and over and over,” she said. “And we were instructed: don’t you gasp and don’t you cry and do not make a scene, because that can cause a mistrial.”\\nStacey said the sentencing hearing was the first time she and her family were able to talk to the court about how his death affected them. “This is the first time we had control, that we could speak up and that we could gasp aloud and let our tears flow and feel emotion in this courtroom. And we controlled the narrative,” she told 404 Media.\\nJessica Gattuso, the victim’s right attorney that worked with Pelkey’s family, told 404 Media that Arizona’s laws made the AI testimony possible. “We have a victim’s bill of rights,” she said. “[Victims] have the discretion to pick what format they’d like to give the statement. So I didn’t see any issues with the AI and there was no objection. I don’t believe anyone thought there was an issue with it.”\\nAI in the courtroom is a controversial topic and one that both lawyers and judges have gotten frustrated with in the past. In January, a judge in Wyoming chastised a lawyer for citing non-existent cases that AI had hallucinated as part of a lawsuit. In March, a different group of attorneys were caught citing AI hallucinated cases and ordered to pay $15,000.\\nGattuso said she understood the concerns, but felt that Pelkey’s AI avatar was handled deftly. “Stacey was up front and the video itself…said it was AI generated. We were very careful to make sure it was clear that these were the words that the family believed Christopher would have to say,” she said. “At no point did anyone try to pass it off as Chris’ own words.”\\nThe prosecution against Horcasitas was only seeking nine years for the killing. The maximum was 10 and a half years. Stacey had asked the judge for the full sentence during her own impact statement. The judge granted her request, something Stacey credits—in part—to the AI video.\\n“Our goal was to make the judge cry. Our goal was to bring Chris to life and to humanize him,” she said.\"}\n",

The company recently released the latest version of Gemstone, adding new cutting-edge AI features, better masking, and more.\\nUnlike ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate 2025, which is an all-in-one photo management and editing application akin to Lightroom, ACDSee Gemstone Photo Editor 15 is more like Photoshop. It features a layer-based workflow, extensive RAW file support, and many features targeted at photographers and graphics designers.\\nMany of Gemstone’s new features rely on advanced artificial intelligence, including ACDSee AI Super-Resolution to enlarge photos, non-destructive AI object masking to easily select and isolate objects in an image, AI Sky Replacement to quickly swap out a dull sky for a new, exciting one, and AI Face Edit to easily retouch portraits.\\nNew and existing AI tools rely on local GPU power, ensuring that the user’s content remains secure while delivering superior AI performance compared to using a computer’s CPU.\\nThere are new tools that don’t rely on AI as well, including new non-destructive color and luminance range masking, new mask refinement controls, more advanced color correction tools, and robust photo merge functionality for creating panoramas and HDR photos.\\n“With ACDSee Gemstone Photo Editor 15, we’ve introduced more AI-driven tools to make complex editing tasks more accessible and efficient,” says Frank Lin, COO and CTO at ACD Systems. “ACDSee software is all about making life easier.”\\nFor users unfamiliar with ACDSee Gemstone Photo Editor, the latest version includes some of the same great features as prior versions, including a tabbed multi-document interface (like Photoshop), non-destructive RAW photo editing, and repair and restoration tools (including heal, dehaze, denies, and more).\\nUnfortunately for Mac users, ACDSee Gemstone Photo Editor 15 is not available on macOS — it is Windows only. Mac users can opt for Photo Studio for Mac 11, which is, like Photo Studio Ultimate 2025 on Windows, a Lightroom alternative rather than a Photoshop one.\\nThat said, for Windows users, Gemstone Photo Editor 15 has a nifty trick up its sleeve that Photoshop doesn’t — a lifetime license. ACDSee Gemstone Photo Editor 15 is available now for a one-time fee of $69.95. There is also a free trial available to download directly from ACDSee’s website.\\nImage credits: ACD Systems'}\n",

But is the next generation of workers already too hooked on the tech?\\nAI Is Reshaping the Workplace, but Entry-Level Hires Are Way Ahead of the Game\\nAI is changing how and what people do at work. But is the next generation of workers already too hooked on the tech?\\nIllustration: Getty Images\\nIn a fascinating fireside chat at the recent SXSW Conference in Austin, two experts dug right into the details of how generative AI is impacting workplaces globally. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania just published a useful summary of the main points tackled by Neil Hoyne, Google’s chief measurement strategist and a Wharton senior fellow, and Wharton marketing professor Stefano Puntoni. College kids are way ahead of them.\\nThe thinkers’ insights are interesting, and may change your own thinking about allowing your staff to use AI at the office, but a separate report from New York magazine might have even more of an impact on your company. It’s a useful look at the emerging workforce, particularly new staff fresh out of college, because it shows exactly how deeply reliant on AI tech today’s students have already become.\\nAs companies are seduced by the promise that AI will boost workers’ efficiency and save money and race to embrace the tech, the two academics concluded its presence is already changing some workplace norms. Hoyne and Puntoni said they think AI is not yet “replacing” people in the workplace, but it is definitely “reshaping it.”\\nThere’s a parallel, the two think, between the way that Adobe’s groundbreaking Photoshop software dramatically changed the photography profession, and the way AI will shift what workers actually do with their eight-hour workdays at the office. The key to making this transition seamless is clearly identifying which tasks are simply utilitarian and can be given to AIs, and the work that still relies on human smarts. That why Puntoni called the advent of AI a “human capital story” versus a simple “tech story.”\\nTo make the most of AI, however, Hoyne and Puntoni warned against merely using it as a branding or sales marker—”we use AI” could become an empty slogan if a company isn’t actually leveraging AI as a “technological differentiator” to truly boost their business. Another risk is deploying AI incorrectly, asking it to take on tasks that humans think they’ll perform better. People are usually happy with the idea of having mundane duties automated, Wharton’s blog noted, but AIs aren’t good at ethical issues, true creativity, and softer management skills like accountability and leadership.\\nThe Wharton experts also echoed numerous AI critics who argue what AI really will force companies to do is recalibrate or reorganize the workforce, shifting people into new roles and reskilling staff where necessary. They didn’t shy away from saying AI will steal some people’s jobs, but in general by training their workers companies using AI will best see the benefits.\\nThe best-case outcome, they said, is that AI will change people’s relationship with work—freeing up time may allow people to tie their identity less to their jobs, and allow them to pursue more hobbies, or more educational pursuits. As Puntoni put it, “Seeing gen AI as a threat is really uninspiring.” AI critics may argue Puntoni has watched one too many Star Trek episodes, since this sci-fi franchise is set in a pseudo-utopian future where that view of work dominates.\\nMeanwhile, New York magazine contends that students are already so in love with the time and energy saving powers of chatbots that “everyone” is using the tools to cheat their way through their studies. Sooner than you might think, these hooked-on-AI youngsters may be your new recruits.\\nNews site The Verge points out a particularly worrisome case from the report, in an interview with a student named Wendy who used ChatGPT to write an essay for her. That, you may think, is bad enough—the whole purpose of writing an essay is to get to grips with the subject matter, and show you can logically frame and complete an argument about it. These are exactly the sort of critical thinking, problem solving skills you may think that companies look for in new recruits—for work on almost any subject, product, or industry.\\nBut the situation is so much worse because the essay was about how tech use is directly impacting students’ ability to think critically. The interviewer asked her if she “recognized the irony in using AI to write not just a paper on critical pedagogy but one that argues learning is what ‘makes us truly human.’ She wasn’t sure what to make of the question.”\\nHiring the right kind of worker from this cohort when they graduate and start looking for jobs might get tricky.\\nThe super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.

      "async_langchain: 4, {'article': 'Page title: AI Isn’t Just a Tool—It’s a Test | Psychology Today\\nSocial card title: AI Isn’t Just a Tool—It’s a Test\\nSocial card description: AI isn’t replacing us—it’s revealing us, testing whether we still show up with the full agency of being human.\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nAI Isn’t Just a Tool—It’s a Test\\nAI is a test not of its intelligence, but of ours.\\nUpdated May 7, 2025 Reviewed by Kaja Perina\\nKey points\\n- AI isn’t the test—it’s the mirror. What’s truly measured is our discernment and curiosity.\\n- AI\\'s allure lies in its convincing mimicry, challenging our capacity for critical thinking.\\n- The danger isn’t AI’s rise—it’s our retreat and staying present is how we steward our own intelligence.\\nTwo recent articles point to something subtle but significant unfolding in our relationship with artificial intelligence. In Rolling Stone, writer Miles Klee critiques the growing presence of AI with a cultural skepticism that’s hard to ignore. He paints it as theater—flashy, convenient, and uncomfortably hollow. In contrast, my own post in Psychology Today offers a different but related view that AI, especially large language models (LLMs), present what I call cognitive theater—an elegant performance of intelligence that feels real, even when it isn’t. Klee questions the cultural spectacle. I question the cognitive seduction. Both perspectives point to the same deeper truth that is as fascinating as it is concerning.\\nI see it almost every day. Smart, thoughtful people become wide-eyed and breathless when an AI tool mimics something clever, or poetic, or eerily human. There’s often a moment of awe, followed quickly by a kind of surrender.\\nThis isn’t gullibility, it’s enchantment. And I understand it. I’ve felt it too. But part of my job now—part of all of our jobs—is to gently pull people back from that edge. Not to diminish the wonder, but to restore the context. To remind ourselves that beneath the magic is machinery. Beneath the fluency, prediction. And that if we mistake performance for presence, we may forfeit something essential—our own capacity to think with intention.\\nThe Performance of Thought\\nToday’s AI doesn’t think in any traditional sense. It doesn’t understand what it says or intend what it outputs. And yet, it speaks with remarkable fluency, mimicking the cadence, tone, and structure of our real thoughts. That’s not a bug—it’s the design. Large language models operate through statistical prediction. They draw on enormous datasets to generate text that fits the prompt, the moment, and often the emotion of the exchange.\\nBut here’s the catch, the more convincing the performance, the more likely we are to suspend disbelief. We hear intelligence. We project understanding. And over time, the line between real and rendered cognition begins to blur.\\nThe danger is not in what the AI knows—it \"knows\" nothing—but in what we assume it knows because it sounds like us.\\nWhen Convenience Replaces Cognition\\nIn professional and personal settings alike, AI is stepping into roles traditionally defined by human judgment. In medicine, AI-assisted diagnostics and decision-support tools hold great promise—offering speed, scalability, and pattern recognition that can genuinely enhance care. But the challenge isn’t just technical accuracy, it’s cognitive trust. As these systems grow more confident in tone, we must be careful not to confuse confidence with correctness. A model trained on partial or biased data can still sound persuasive. That’s why an element of criticality needs to be part of our engagement—from the kitchen to the boardroom.\\nAcross sectors—education, medicine, business—the potential of AI is real. And so is the value of cognitive off-loading. Used wisely, it can reduce noise, accelerate routine tasks, and give us more space to think creatively and act decisively. But there’s a line—subtle but critical—between off-loading and outsourcing ourselves. The risk isn’t overreach, but under-engagement that allows the tool to replace not just effort, but intention.\\nThat’s where the danger lies—not in what AI can generate, but in what we quietly stop generating on our own.\\nThe Risk Isn’t Replacement—It’s Retreat\\nFor years, we’ve debated whether AI will replace human workers, thinkers, or creators. But the more subtle and immediate risk is that we might retreat from the very tasks that make us most human—not because we’re forced to, but because it’s easier. The friction that once demanded engagement is starting to dissolve. That’s not necessarily a problem. But it is a shift that deserves our attention.\\nThis is not an anti-technology message. I’ve spent decades championing innovation and embracing the potential of digital transformation. But even the most transformative tools require thoughtful use. The real danger isn’t that AI will take over. It’s that we’ll slowly, quietly, stop showing up with the full force of our human discernment.\\nThe risk is that we\\'ll let fluency replace curiosity and tragically, let performance stand in for presence.\\nHolding the Line\\nSo what does it mean to hold the line? It means staying mentally engaged, even when the machine offers a shortcut. It means reviewing that AI-generated draft with a critical eye. It means remembering that insight doesn’t arrive fully formed—it often comes from the struggle to find clarity. That struggle, that cognitive friction, is still ours to own.\\nHolding the line doesn’t mean rejecting AI. It means partnering with it intelligently. It means using its fluency as a springboard—not a substitute. The best uses of AI don’t diminish us—they demand more of us. They call us to think more clearly, to question more deeply, and to refine what matters most in the age of synthetic thought.\\nStill Ours to Steward\\nAI doesn’t care. But it performs—brilliantly. And when we accept that performance without question, the test isn’t about the machine—it’s about us. This moment isn’t about whether AI can pass for intelligent.

While generative AI tools may boost productivity for some, they might also secretly damage your professional reputation.\\nOn Thursday, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) published a study showing that employees who use AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini at work face negative judgments about their competence and motivation from colleagues and managers.\\n\"Our findings reveal a dilemma for people considering adopting AI tools: Although AI can enhance productivity, its use carries social costs,\" write researchers Jessica A. Reif, Richard P. Larrick, and Jack B. Soll of Duke\\'s Fuqua School of Business.\\nThe Duke team conducted four experiments with over 4,400 participants to examine both anticipated and actual evaluations of AI tool users. Their findings, presented in a paper titled \"Evidence of a social evaluation penalty for using AI,\" reveal a consistent pattern of bias against those who receive help from AI.\\nWhat made this penalty particularly concerning for the researchers was its consistency across demographics. They found that the social stigma against AI use wasn\\'t limited to specific groups.\\n\"Testing a broad range of stimuli enabled us to examine whether the target\\'s age, gender, or occupation qualifies the effect of receiving help from Al on these evaluations,\" the authors wrote in the paper. \"We found that none of these target demographic attributes influences the effect of receiving Al help on perceptions of laziness, diligence, competence, independence, or self-assuredness. This suggests that the social stigmatization of AI use is not limited to its use among particular demographic groups. The result appears to be a general one.\"\\nThe hidden social cost of AI adoption\\nIn the first experiment conducted by the team from Duke, participants imagined using either an AI tool or a dashboard creation tool at work. It revealed that those in the AI group expected to be judged as lazier, less competent, less diligent, and more replaceable than those using conventional technology. They also reported less willingness to disclose their AI use to colleagues and managers.\\nThe second experiment confirmed these fears were justified. When evaluating descriptions of employees, participants consistently rated those receiving AI help as lazier, less competent, less diligent, less independent, and less self-assured than those receiving similar help from non-AI sources or no help at all.'}\n",

She struggled to find the right words, but one voice was clear: her brother\\'s.\\n\"I couldn\\'t help hear his voice in my head of what he would say,\" Wales told NPR.\\nThat\\'s when the idea came to her: to use artificial intelligence to generate a video of how her late brother, Christopher Pelkey, would address the courtroom and specifically the man who fatally shot him at a red light in 2021.\\nOn Thursday, Wales stood before the court and played the video — in what AI experts say is likely the first time the technology has been used in the U.S. to create an impact statement read by an AI rendering of the deceased victim.\\nA sister looking for the right words\\nWales has been thinking about her victim impact statement since the initial trial in 2023. The case was retried in 2025 because of procedural problems with the first trial.\\nThe chance to speak in court meant a great deal to Wales, who held back her emotions throughout both trials to avoid influencing the jury.\\n\"You\\'re told that you cannot react, you cannot emote, you cannot cry,\" she said. \"We looked forward to [sentencing] because we finally were gonna be able to react.\"\\nWales\\' attorney told her to humanize Pelkey and offer a complete picture of who he was.\\nSo Wales went on a mission. She said she contacted as many people from Pelkey\\'s life — from his elementary school teacher to high school prom date to the soldiers he served alongside in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\nIn total, Wales gathered 48 victim impact statements — not counting her own. When it was time to write hers, she was torn between saying how she truly felt and what she thought the judge would want to hear.\\n\"I didn\\'t wanna get up there and say, \\'I forgive you,\\' \\'cause I don\\'t, I\\'m not there yet,\" she said. \"And the dichotomy was that I could hear Chris\\' voice in my head and he\\'s like, \\'I forgive him.\\'\"\\nPelkey\\'s mantra had always been to love God and love others, according to Wales. He was the kind of man who would give the shirt off his back, she said. While she struggled to find the right words for herself, Wales said writing from his perspective came naturally.\\n\"I knew what he stood for and it was just very clear to me what he would say,\" she added.\\nA digitally trimmed beard and an inserted laugh\\nThat night, Wales turned to her husband Tim, who has experience using AI for work.\\n\"He doesn\\'t get a say. He doesn\\'t get a chance to speak,\" Wales said, referring to her brother. \"We can\\'t let that happen. We have to give him a voice.\"\\nTim and their business partner Scott Yentzer had only a few days to produce the video. The challenge: there\\'s no single program built for a project like this. They also needed a long, clear audio clip of Pelkey\\'s voice and a photo of him looking straight to the camera — neither of which Wales had.\\nStill, using several AI tools, Wales\\' husband and Yentzer managed to create a convincing video using about a 4.5-minute-video of Pelkey, his funeral photo and a script that Wales prepared. They digitally removed the sunglasses on top of Pelkey\\'s hat and trimmed his beard — which had been causing technological issues.\\nWales, who was heavily involved in making sure the video felt true to life, said recreating her brother\\'s laugh was especially tough because most clips of Pelkey were filled with background noise.\\nThe experience made Wales reflect on her own mortality. So one evening, Wales stepped into her closest and recorded a nine-minute-video of herself talking and laughing — just in case her family ever needs clear audio of her voice someday.\\n\"It was a weird out-of-body experience to think that way about your own mortality, but you never know when you\\'re going to not be here,\" she said.\\nThe night before the sentencing hearing, Wales called her victim rights attorney, Jessica Gattuso, to tell her about the video. Gattuso told NPR that she was initially hesitant about the idea because she had never heard of it being done before in Arizona court. She was also worried that the video may not be received well. But after seeing the video, she felt compelled that it should be viewed in court.\\n\"I knew it would have an impact on everyone including the shooter, because it was a message of forgiveness,\" Gattuso said.\\nThe AI generated video helped with healing, sister says\\nTen people spoke in support of Pelkey at the sentencing hearing. The AI-generated video of him went last.\\n\"Hello. Just to be clear for everyone seeing this, I\\'m a version of Chris Pelkey recreated through AI that uses my picture and my voice profile,\" the AI avatar said.\\nThe video went on to thank everyone in Pelkey\\'s life who contributed an impact statement and attended the hearing. Then, the video addressed his shooter, Gabriel Paul Horcasitas.\\n\"It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances. In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness and in God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the video said.\\nThe video ended with the avatar encouraging everyone to love one another and live life to the fullest. \"Well, I\\'m gonna go fishing now. Love you all. See you on the other side,\" it concluded.\\nNeither the defense nor the judge pushed back. Later in the hearing, Judge Todd Lang said, \"I loved that AI. Thank you for that.\"\\nHe added, \"It says something about the family because you told me how angry you were and you demanded the maximum sentence. And even thought that\\'s what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart, as you saw it. I didn\\'t hear him asking for the maximum sentence.\" Horcasitas received 10.5 years for manslaughter.\\nWales said she didn\\'t realize how deeply the video would affect her and her family. For her teenage son, it was a chance to hear his uncle say goodbye. For Wales, it gave her the strength to finally look back at photos of her brother.\\n\"Going through this process of AI and what he\\'d sound like and trimming his beard and inserting laughs and all these other things, it was very cathartic and it was part of the healing process,\" she said.\\nWhat AI and legal experts say\\nOver the years, there have been a growing number of examples testing the bounds of AI\\'s role in the courtroom.\\nFor instance, in 2023, President Trump\\'s former lawyer Michael Cohen unwittingly sent his attorney bogus AI-generated legal citations. More recently, last month, a man attempted to use an AI-generated lawyer avatar in court — an effort that was quickly shut down by the judge.\\nBut the use of AI for a victim impact statement appears novel, according to Maura Grossman, a professor at the University of Waterloo who has studied the applications of AI in criminal and civil cases. She added, that she did not see any major legal or ethical issues in Pelkey\\'s case.\\n\"Because this is in front of a judge, not a jury, and because the video wasn\\'t submitted as evidence per se, its impact is more limited,\" she told NPR via email.\\nSome experts, including Grossman, predict generative AI will become more common in the legal system, but it raises various legal and ethical questions. When it comes to victim impact statements, key concerns include questions around consent, fairness and whether the content was made in good faith.\\n\"Victim statements like this that truly try to represent the dead victim\\'s voice are probably the least objectionable use of AI to create false videos or statements,\" Gary Marchant, a professor of law, ethics and emerging technologies at Arizona State University\\'s Sandra Day O\\'Connor College of Law, wrote in an email.\\n\"Many attempts to use AI to create deep fakes will be much more malevolent,\" he added.\\nWales herself cautions people who may follow in her footsteps to act with integrity and not be driven by selfish motives. \"I could have been very selfish with it,\" she said. \"But it was important not to give any one person or group closure that could leave somebody else out.\"'}\n",

Learn More\\nResearchers at Alibaba Group have developed a novel approach that could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of training AI systems to search for information, eliminating the need for expensive commercial search engine APIs altogether.\\nThe technique, called “ZeroSearch,” allows large language models (LLMs) to develop advanced search capabilities through a simulation approach rather than interacting with real search engines during the training process. This innovation could save companies significant API expenses while offering better control over how AI systems learn to retrieve information.\\n“Reinforcement learning [RL] training requires frequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search requests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain scalability,” write the researchers in their paper published on arXiv this week. “To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of LLMs without interacting with real search engines.”\\nHow ZeroSearch trains AI to search without search engines\\nThe problem that ZeroSearch solves is significant. Companies developing AI assistants that can autonomously search for information face two major challenges: the unpredictable quality of documents returned by search engines during training, and the prohibitively high costs of making hundreds of thousands of API calls to commercial search engines like Google.\\nAlibaba’s approach begins with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process to transform an LLM into a retrieval module capable of generating both relevant and irrelevant documents in response to a query. During reinforcement learning training, the system employs what the researchers call a “curriculum-based rollout strategy” that gradually degrades the quality of generated documents.\\n“Our key insight is that LLMs have acquired extensive world knowledge during large-scale pretraining and are capable of generating relevant documents given a search query,” the researchers explain. “The primary difference between a real search engine and a simulation LLM lies in the textual style of the returned content.”\\nOutperforming Google at a fraction of the cost\\nIn comprehensive experiments across seven question-answering datasets, ZeroSearch not only matched but often surpassed the performance of models trained with real search engines. Remarkably, a 7B-parameter retrieval module achieved performance comparable to Google Search, while a 14B-parameter module even outperformed it.\\nThe cost savings are substantial. According to the researchers’ analysis, training with approximately 64,000 search queries using Google Search via SerpAPI would cost about $586.70, while using a 14B-parameter simulation LLM on four A100 GPUs costs only $70.80 — an 88% reduction.\\n“This demonstrates the feasibility of using a well-trained LLM as a substitute for real search engines in reinforcement learning setups,” the paper notes.\\nWhat this means for the future of AI development\\nThis breakthrough is a major shift in how AI systems can be trained. ZeroSearch shows that AI can improve without depending on external tools like search engines.\\nThe impact could be substantial for the AI industry. Until now, training advanced AI systems often required expensive API calls to services controlled by big tech companies. ZeroSearch changes this equation by allowing AI to simulate search instead of using actual search engines.\\nFor smaller AI companies and startups with limited budgets, this approach could level the playing field. The high costs of API calls have been a major barrier to entry in developing sophisticated AI assistants. By cutting these costs by nearly 90%, ZeroSearch makes advanced AI training more accessible.\\nBeyond cost savings, this technique gives developers more control over the training process. When using real search engines, the quality of returned documents is unpredictable. With simulated search, developers can precisely control what information the AI sees during training.\\nThe technique works across multiple model families, including Qwen-2.5 and LLaMA-3.2, and with both base and instruction-tuned variants. The researchers have made their code, datasets, and pre-trained models available on GitHub and Hugging Face, allowing other researchers and companies to implement the approach.\\nAs large language models continue to evolve, techniques like ZeroSearch suggest a future where AI systems can develop increasingly sophisticated capabilities through self-simulation rather than relying on external services — potentially changing the economics of AI development and reducing dependencies on large technology platforms.\\nThe irony is clear: in teaching AI to search without search engines, Alibaba may have created a technology that makes traditional search engines less necessary for AI development. As these systems become more self-sufficient, the technology landscape could look very different in just a few years.'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 12, {'article': 'Page title: Business leaders are losing trust in their data — agentic analytics promises a fix\\nSocial card title: Anthropic launches Claude web search API, betting on the future of post-Google information access\\nSocial card description: Anthropic launches web search API for Claude as Apple considers AI search alternatives to Google, signaling a major shift in how users discover information online.\\nJoin our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\\nAnthropic has introduced a web search capability for its Claude AI assistant, intensifying competition in the rapidly evolving AI search market where tech giants are racing to redefine how users find information online.\\nThe company announced today that developers can now enable Claude to access current web information through its API, allowing the AI assistant to conduct multiple progressive searches to compile comprehensive answers complete with source citations. The move comes as web search undergoes its most significant transformation since Google revolutionized the field more than two decades ago.\\n“Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to the Messages API,” Anthropic said in its announcement.\\nThe new capability arrives amid signs that traditional search is losing ground to AI-powered alternatives. Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, testified today in Google’s antitrust trial that searches in Safari fell last month for the first time in the browser’s 22-year history. “I’ve lost a lot of sleep thinking about it,” Cue said regarding potential revenue loss from Google’s estimated $20 billion payment to be Safari’s default search engine.\\nAI assistants are eating Google’s lunch: The decline of traditional search engine dominance\\nThe data points to a seismic shift in information discovery patterns. SOCi’s Consumer Behavior Index shows that 19% of consumers already use AI for search, creating the first meaningful challenge to Google’s stranglehold on web information access in decades.\\nThis transformation stems from fundamental differences in how AI assistants process and present information. Unlike traditional search engines that display a list of links requiring users to sift through results, AI assistants synthesize information from multiple sources, delivering concise, contextual answers. This eliminates the cognitive load of evaluating numerous websites and extracts the precise information users seek.\\nThe timing of Anthropic’s announcement is particularly significant. With Safari searches declining for the first time ever — a metric Cue called unprecedented in his testimony — we’re witnessing early indicators of a mass consumer behavior shift. Traditional search engines optimized for advertising revenue are increasingly being bypassed in favor of conversation-based interactions that prioritize information quality over commercial interests.\\nUnder the hood: How Anthropic’s API transforms information retrieval for developers\\nAnthropic’s technical approach represents a significant advance in how AI systems can be deployed as information gathering tools. The system employs a sophisticated decision-making layer that determines when external information would improve response quality, generating targeted search queries rather than simply passing user questions verbatim to a search backend.\\nThis “agentic” capability — allowing Claude to conduct multiple progressive searches using earlier results to inform subsequent queries — enables a more thorough research process than traditional search. The implementation essentially mimics how a human researcher might explore a topic, starting with general queries and progressively refining them based on initial findings.\\nFor developers, the API offers granular control through the max_uses\\nparameter that limits how many sequential searches Claude can perform. This addresses both cost considerations and prevents the AI from falling into research rabbit holes. The domain control features provide crucial guardrails for enterprise deployments, allowing organizations to ensure information comes only from trusted sources.\\nAt $10 per 1,000 searches plus standard token costs, Anthropic has positioned the feature as a premium offering, suggesting confidence that the value proposition justifies the price point compared to direct integration with free search engines.\\nAI search wars heat up: Big tech scrambles to redefine digital information access\\nThe competitive landscape around AI search has become increasingly crowded and contentious. OpenAI integrated web search into ChatGPT last fall and recently expanded with shopping features, leveraging its massive user base — 800 million weekly active users, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — to challenge Google’s commercial search dominance.\\nApple’s potential pivot represents perhaps the most significant threat to the status quo. With Safari accounting for 17.25% of global browser usage and 22.32% on mobile devices according to the most current data from StatCounter, any move to replace Google with AI search alternatives would dramatically alter market dynamics. Apple’s discussions with Perplexity AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic suggest the company is actively exploring multiple partnerships rather than developing its own search technology.\\nMeanwhile, specialized players like Perplexity AI are making strategic moves to embed themselves directly in the hardware ecosystem. Its partnership with Motorola represents an early attempt to position AI search as a device-level feature rather than merely an app or website. Google’s reported resistance to this partnership, revealed during antitrust proceedings, indicates the search giant recognizes the existential threat these new models pose.\\nThe court-mandated unwinding of Google’s Safari search deal — potentially eliminating up to $20 billion in annual payments to Apple — may accelerate this transition by removing the financial incentive for Apple to maintain the status quo.\\nContent economy disruption: Publishers face existential threat as AI bypasses traditional websites\\nThe shift to AI search presents profound challenges for the content economy that has evolved around traditional search engines. When AI assistants provide direct answers synthesized from multiple sources, they dramatically reduce click-through to original content sites. This threatens the advertising-based business model that sustains much of the internet’s information ecosystem.\\nGoogle Search vice president Pandu Nayak’s inability to offer “any guarantees” about traffic recovery highlights the gravity of this situation. Content creators face a future where being cited by AI may become more important than appearing in search results — yet citations alone don’t generate the advertising revenue that sustains content creation.\\nThis creates a potentially unsustainable dynamic: AI systems rely on high-quality web content to generate responses, but by redirecting user attention away from source websites, they undermine the economic model that produces that content. Without a new compensation mechanism for content creators, the long-term health of the information ecosystem could be compromised.\\nFor businesses, this shift demands a fundamental rethinking of digital strategy. Content optimized for traditional SEO may perform poorly in AI-mediated discovery, while content focused on providing clear, authoritative information may gain prominence even without traditional SEO markers.\\nBeyond search: How AI information tools are reshaping the internet’s future\\nAnthropic’s web search API represents more than just another feature in the AI toolkit — it signals the evolution of internet information access toward a more integrated, conversation-based model. As search capabilities become embedded in AI assistants across applications, the distinction between searching, browsing, and asking questions continues to blur.\\nThis convergence is evident in how Quora is incorporating web search into its Poe platform and how Adaptive.ai plans to use it in customer-facing applications. Rather than search existing as a separate activity, it’s becoming an ambient capability woven throughout the digital experience.\\nFor everyday users, this could eventually eliminate the need to think about where to look for information — whether on Google, in a specialized app, or through an AI assistant. The cognitive load of navigating the internet’s information architecture would shift from humans to AI systems.\\nThe race to redefine search has evolved into something much larger: a competition to create the primary interface through which people access digital information. With Google’s traditional search model faltering, Apple potentially pivoting away from its long-standing Google partnership, and companies like Anthropic opening their capabilities to the developer ecosystem, we’re witnessing the most significant restructuring of information access since the advent of modern search engines.\\nIn this new paradigm, the winner won’t be determined by who has the best search algorithm, but by who creates the most intuitive, trusted, and capable AI interface to the world’s information. The era of typing keywords into a search box may soon be remembered as merely a transitional phase in our relationship with digital knowledge.'}\n",

These SoCs use less energy than the chips in devices like the iPhone, and Apple has already optimized it to improve power efficiency.\\nWhile Apple is designing the Ray-Ban like glasses to compete with Meta, it is still working on augmented reality glasses, but that product will not be ready for some time.\"}\n",

This legal challenge could potentially compel the two technology giants to dismantle the agreement.\\nThe consideration of AI search integration comes as AI technology gains traction with consumers. Cue noted a recent dip in Safari searches, which he attributed to increased use of AI. He expressed belief that AI search providers, such as OpenAI, Perplexity AI and Anthropic, will eventually supplant standard search engines like Google. Cue stated that Apple plans to add these options to Safari in the future. Apple has held discussions with Perplexity to implement this capability.\\nAccording to Cue’s testimony, he previously felt that alternative search options were not “valid choices.” Presently, however, he said he sees “much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”\\nThis move represents a major shift for Apple, whose users have relied on Google search in Safari since the iPhone’s debut in 2007. The company currently has more than 2 billion active devices worldwide.\\nThe testimony reportedly led to declines in both Alphabet and Apple shares on Wednesday. While Cue acknowledged the financial benefits of the current agreement with Google and the potential revenue loss, he also stated his belief that technology shifts, like AI, create opportunities for new entrants and true competition.\\nApple currently offers OpenAI’s ChatGPT via the Siri digital assistant and is expected to add Google’s Gemini later in the year. The company also reviewed Anthropic, DeepSeek and Grok from xAI for this purpose. Cue mentioned a “bake-off” between ChatGPT and Google’s offering before ChatGPT was selected for integration into Apple Intelligence in iOS 18 last year.\\nOpenAI is making a strong play for the consumer market with the hiring of Instacart’s CEO to oversee its applications business — a signal that the company is more than just an artificial intelligence (AI) model builder.\\nEarlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that Fidji Simo, who already sits on OpenAI and Shopify’s boards, will become the company’s CEO of Applications, the division responsible for turning its research and models into products that directly benefit users.\\nThe new Applications unit will bring together “a group of existing business and operational teams responsible for how our research reaches and benefits the world,” according to Altman’s blog post, and Simo is “uniquely qualified to lead this group.”\\nSimo will officially join OpenAI later this year, reporting to Altman.\\n“OpenAI clearly wants to own the consumer platform,” Julia Huang, founding partner at Vesey Ventures, told PYMNTS. “They have a great shot at doing it and Fidji’s experience at Instacart in bringing together merchants and consumers would be really valuable.”\\nHuang added, “The challenge to Google is clear already in search,” since people have been moving to AI chatbots for searches. “I think this will be a play to close the loop around the whole transaction.”\\nLast week, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal announced separate initiatives to deploy agentic commerce, where an AI agent will autonomously pay for transactions on behalf of users.\\nAs part of the initiative, Visa said it is working with AI chatbot makers OpenAI, Perplexity, Anthropic and Microsoft to deploy the capability.\\nMeanwhile, other AI model companies such as Perplexity are adding shopping capabilities into their chatbots, amid a competitive race to lead in product discovery — and eventually purchases as well.\\nRead more: OpenAI Turns ChatGPT Into Shopping Assistant With New Commerce Features\\nThe pivot to shopping comes as ChatGPT’s popularity continues to grow. Just 2½ years old, ChatGPT now has 500 million weekly users worldwide, Altman disclosed during a congressional hearing on Thursday (May 8).\\nChatGPT.com is now the fifth most visited website in the world, Altman added, citing statistics from SimilarWeb. Google.com is on top, followed by YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\\nWith this many eyeballs, it’s no wonder OpenAI is accelerating plans for its consumer business.\\n“This is a power move,” said Jeanel Alvarado, CEO of research firm Retailboss. “The CEO of Instacart has a track record of building killer consumer apps. OpenAI is walking straight into Google’s backyard and challenging Google’s search, ads and AI-powered tools.”\\nAlvarado told PYMNTS that OpenAI may be gearing up to “supercharge AI-powered shopping experiences. Think more intelligent shopping and product recommendations, ultra-personalized customer journeys, and behind-the-scenes AI that keeps shelves stocked just right.”\\nOpenAI recently improved its shopping results for ChatGPT. The company disclosed that when ChatGPT displays a selection of products with links to retailers, these are selected “independently and are not ads.”\\nThat means retailers do not pay OpenAI to display their products first in ChatGPT searches. Instead, ChatGPT chooses products when it is “relevant to the user’s intent” based on the user prompt, prior ‘custom’ instructions from the user and other user data it recalls.\\nAt OpenAI, adding Simo to the leadership team to oversee applications is a sign that the company sees this market as potentially becoming even bigger than the AI model market.\\n“The OpenAI hire of Fidji Simo signals a strategic recognition that controlling the application layer might matter more than the model layer alone,” said Dev Nag, a Stanford researcher and CEO of AI startup QueryPal, which is backed by Sequoia Capital, the VC firm that was an early investor in Apple, Google, YouTube, Instagram and many more.\\n“While everyone fixates on model quality improvements, the real moats are forming around user experience, data feedback loops, and the ability to execute real-world actions like shopping,” Nag told PYMNTS.\\nZohar Gilad, CEO of shopping optimization platform Fast Simon, said Simo will give OpenAI “a front-row seat to what merchants need next.”\\nNearly 40% of product discovery today still begins on search engines, but that’s changing, Gilad told PYMNTS. “Simo’s leadership will help OpenAI build faster, more commerce-aware applications that keep brands visible as product discovery expands to new platforms.”\\nAffirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions.\\nThe financial services company announced the collaboration Thursday (May 8) in a shareholder letter. Customers, if approved, will be to able select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco’s website.\\n“[We] are proud to announce our online partnership with Costco — a brand and a retailer I have personally admired for a long time because of their unwavering commitment to customer experience and transparency,” Affirm CEO Max Levchin wrote. “It will be a privilege to deliver honest financial products to their members.”\\nCostco has been looking for ways to use BNPL to drive loyalty for some time. In 2023, the warehouse club chain partnered with Citi for Costco Anywhere Visa cardmembers to access the Citi Flex Pay BNPL option to pay for purchases.\\nAffirm, for its part, has been expanding availability across several sectors. This month, the company launched a partnership with airline-owned network UATP to enable travelers to use BNPL. In April, fashion retailer Revolve Group announced it was integrating Affirm’s pay later functionality.\\nThe adoption of pay-over-time options has become more prevalent among consumers as an alternative to traditional credit cards, particularly amid rising interest rates and elevated inflation. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Pay Later Revolution: Redefining the Credit Economy,” the size of the BNPL market in the U.S. now amounts to $175 billion and usage is on the rise. Near the end of 2024, 38% of U.S. consumers were using BNPL, up from 24% the year prior.\\nWhile some consumers are adopting the payment method by choice, using it to optimize cash flow and manage payment for larger purchases, others are using it out of necessity. Individuals doing so by choice spend more on average using BNPL ($777) than those using it because they have to ($576), according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “New Data: Defining the New Buy Now, Pay Later Consumer.”\\nAmid economic uncertainty, many consumers are turning to the option to manage their spending.\\n“[People] want certainty — especially in an environment where, economically, things are a bit uncertain,” Versatile Credit CEO Ed O’Donnell told PYMNTS in March. “Planning is important and confidence is important — [and with pay later] you can create your own confidence within your own budget.”\\nPeloton Interactive reported strong results Thursday (May 8) for the third quarter, surpassing guidance on key metrics and showcasing progress on profitability. The company also raised its full-year fiscal 2025 guidance across several key financial measures.\\nCEO Peter Stern highlighted achieving key metrics, improving member outcomes, expanding market reach, and enhancing efficiency during the company’s earnings call on Thursday.\\nPersonalized Plans, introduced in January, have been started by nearly 500,000 members by the end of Q3. Engagement metrics indicated higher participation. The company observed year-over-year growth in running workouts (5%) and walking workouts (11%) engagement, with over 80% of Tread users using Pace Targets, up from just under 60% the previous quarter. Strength, mobility, and meditation engagement also increased year-over-year.\\nPaid Connected Fitness subscriptions ended the quarter at 2.88 million, a 6% decline year over year. However, subscription churn improved to 1.2% in Q3, down from 1.4% in Q2, according to the company’s shareholder letter. Net Paid Connected Fitness subscriptions saw slight growth quarter-over-quarter. Paid App subscriptions totaled 573,000, a net increase of 12,000 in the quarter. The company described its subscription business as resilient with strong retention.\\nPeloton said it is testing new models, including a micro-store test in Nashville and collaborations with Amazon. The company is also testing new models for placing Peloton in gyms, including at the University of Texas at Austin.\\nRead more: Peloton Continues Comeback With Strong Subscription Metrics\\nQ3 revenue was $624 million, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $9 million. This included $205 million from Connected Fitness products and $419 million from subscriptions. Total gross profit was $318 million, an increase of $8 million or 3% year over year. Connected Fitness products’ gross margin increased to 14.3%, while subscription gross margin was 69%.\\nOperating expenses decreased 23% year over year. The company is on track toward achieving its target of $200 million in annualized run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025.\\nAdjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $89 million, exceeding guidance.\\nManagement expressed satisfaction with the Q3 results, describing them as strong, surpassing guidance and showcasing effective cost discipline and strategic growth initiatives.\\nPeloton increased its full-year 2025 guidance across several metrics.\\nCEO Stern highlighted the strong Q3 performance, stating they achieved key metrics at the high end of or above guidance. He emphasized the strategic objectives of improving member outcomes, expanding market reach, and enhancing operational efficiency.\\nCFO Liz Coddington said, “We are pleased with our third quarter results as we delivered at the high end of or exceeded guidance on key metrics and continued to make meaningful progress on improving unit economics and profitability.”'}\n",

Google says that\\'s not true. Who\\'s right?\\nSocial card description: Apple says AI engines like ChatGPT are cutting into Google search, but Google says that\\'s not true. Both arguments could be true. \\n- Google stock tumbled Wednesday after Apple\\'s executive Eddy Cue said AI rivals were cutting into the search giant.\\n- Google responded by saying that\\'s not the case.\\n- It\\'s possible that both arguments are correct. The stakes are very high.\\nIs Google screwed?\\nThat\\'s the $2 trillion question the tech world is trying to understand following Wednesday\\'s blockbuster news: A top Apple executive said search queries on the company\\'s Safari browser were declining because people were using AI engines like ChatGPT instead.\\nInvestors immediately acted as if Google\\'s astonishing run at the top of the tech heap was over, and slashed the company\\'s stock by more than 8%.\\nBut a day later, Google\\'s stock was climbing back up a bit, and there\\'s a healthy debate about what Cue\\'s statement means — as well as why he said it.\\nSpoiler: I\\'m not going to solve this one today. But let\\'s at least look at the argument.\\nThe most obvious way to view Cue\\'s comments was the way Wall Street did: that Google search dominance was being eroded by AI competitors.\\nAfter all, fear of being usurped by AI is what pushed Google to fast-track its own AI efforts, even when some of those efforts created embarrassing results.\\nBut later on Wednesday, Google put out a statement that basically said Cue was wrong, without actually saying that out loud. Instead, the company said it was continuing to see increasing searches, and \"that includes an increase in total queries coming from Apple\\'s devices and platforms.\"\\nSo that looks like two of the world\\'s most powerful and valuable companies are disagreeing over basic, knowable facts.\\nBut people who pay attention to this stuff are focusing on three key words in Google\\'s statement: \"total,\" \"devices,\" and \"platforms.\" And the absence of another word: \"Safari.\"\\nAnd that\\'s leading them to translate Google\\'s statement this way: \"Maybe Apple really is seeing fewer searches on Safari, the default web browser on iPhones. But you can use Google in other ways on iPhones — namely, via the Google app, but also via Google\\'s own Chrome browser. And people are using those more — enough to counter any decline elsewhere.\"\\nAssuming that this translation is accurate, that should reassure Google and its boosters a bit, though not completely: Cue said the searches on Safari were down for the first time ever, and that\\'s not the kind of signal you can just wave away.\\nAnd even if Safari Google searchers are really moving to things like the Google app instead, that also underlines the fact that people who used to just type something into their iPhone browser know now they can get results other ways. And there\\'s no reason they couldn\\'t also be searching on Google competitors like ChatGPT.\\nA Google rep declined to comment; Apple hasn\\'t responded to my request for comment.\\nGoogle investors, by the way, don\\'t seem 100% convinced by Google\\'s statement: The stock is up 3% on Thursday, which means Google is still worth 5% less than it was Wednesday morning, when Cue started testifying in the US vs. Google antitrust trial.\\nWhich brings us to the second question Google and Apple watchers are speculating about: Why did Cue say what he said in court, after all?\\nI\\'m an Occam\\'s razor guy, so my first take was that Cue answered the questions he was asked in court.\\nBut there\\'s also a 4D chess argument, put forth by folks like MoffettNathanson\\'s analyst Michael Nathanson. It goes like this: Cue has an incentive to portray Google as a wounded animal.\\nThat\\'s because Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make Google the default search engine on Safari (that\\'s the reason Cue has insight into Google\\'s search activity), and a federal judge has already declared that Google has an illegal monopoly in search.\\nAnd one of the remedies the judge could push for would be to prevent Google from paying Apple for that valuable real estate — which would mean Apple could lose all of that high-margin revenue.\\nSo, the theory goes, convincing the judge that Google no longer has a stranglehold on search, because of AI competition, might allow those payments to keep flowing after all.\\nThat theory also helps explain Google\\'s muted response on Wednesday night, where the company tried to walk the line between tooting its own horn (which bucks up investors but could damage its legal argument) and acknowledging that it has real competition (which could help Google in court but hurt it in the market).\\nWhich brings us back to where we started: Is Google really starting to lose out to the ChatGPTs of the world, and entering a permanent decline, just like pay-TV networks a decade ago? Or is it holding its own despite the competition? Depending on where you\\'re asking the question, Google might give you a different answer.\\nCorrection: May 8, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated which company the Safari browser belongs to. It\\'s Apple, not Google.'}\n",

That\\'s the slowest growth rate since the company began reporting the metric.\\nPaid clicks are exactly what they sound like: people click on ads across Google Search and other services such as Google Play and Gmail.

As recently as 2022, Google had paid Apple at least $20 billion — a massive fee that signals how much value Google sees in having Apple users turn to its search engine for all their queries.\\nIt maintains that this partnership continues to drive growth in searches. Cue\\'s comments were provocative enough to prompt the search giant to issue a public statement stating that it continues to see \"overall query growth\" in Search, including an increase in total queries coming from Apple.\\nThere\\'s little doubt among industry watchers that the overall search pie is growing — though figures from research firm Statcounter suggest Google\\'s control of the global search has fallen slightly. The big question is whether Google\\'s slice of that pie is shrinking relative to rivals.\\nAccording to Statcounter, Google\\'s share of global search traffic fell to 89.71% in March 2025, down from about 91% in March 2024 and about 93% in March 2023.\\nMeanwhile, competing search products are growing. In April, OpenAI said that around 10% of the world uses ChatGPT, which would be at least 800 million users. Meta also said that about 1 billion people use AI across its various products.\\nThe search market expands with AI as chatbots and generative tools expand the definition of search. Google could reap the rewards here, though this also creates an opening for competitors charging as fast as possible to stay ahead of the search giant.\\nBernstein analysts estimated that generative AI queries that run through chatbots such as ChatGPT are reaching volumes close to 15% of the queries processed by Google and other traditional search engines.\\nAnalysts are split\\nOther analysts are divided on just how much of a threat Google\\'s search business faces.\\nRelated stories\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nFor instance, longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo took to X on Wednesday to explain why he felt it was a mistake to think generative AI would not affect Google\\'s advertising business.\\nHe said that despite the \"continued growth of Google\\'s advertising business,\" the company hasn\\'t had much competition yet.\\n\"GenAI service providers have not launched advertising businesses, so Google Ads remains the best choice for online advertisers,\" Kuo wrote.\\nThe following statement by Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, implies that Google search and advertising business are facing potential threats from generative AI (GenAI):\\n— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) May 7, 2025\\nCue noted that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month, which he attributed…\\nKuo likened Google\\'s situation to the one Yahoo faced during the 2000s.

In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance.

      "async_langchain: 21, {'article': 'Page title: Bridging the Gap Between Keyword and Semantic Search with SPLADE - Arcturus Labs\\nBridging the Gap Between Keyword and Semantic Search with SPLADE\\nIn information retrieval, we often find ourselves between two tools: keyword search and semantic search. Each has strengths and limitations. What if we could combine the best of both?\\nBy the end of this post, you will:\\n- Understand the challenges of keyword and semantic search\\n- Learn about SPLADE, an approach that bridges these methods\\n- See a practical implementation of SPLADE to enhance search\\nIf you\\'ve struggled with inaccurate search results or wanted a more transparent search system, this post is for you. Let\\'s explore how SPLADE can change your approach to information retrieval.\\nThe Unfortunate State of the Art\\nWith the rise of RAG methods in prompt engineering, vector-based semantic search has become essential for many applications. It\\'s easy to see why: semantic search overcomes some key limitations of keyword search. In traditional keyword search, you might type terms that mean the same thing as the document you\\'re seeking, but if you use different words, you won\\'t get a match. For example, searching for \"ape costume\" won\\'t find a document mentioning \"gorilla suit.\" Semantic search, on the other hand, converts your query into a vector representing its meaning. If there\\'s a document with a similar meaning (represented by a nearby vector), you get a match!\\nSemantic search seems almost magical... until it\\'s not.\\nThere are some gnarly challenges with semantic search that we\\'re still grappling with:\\n- Larger indexes – Keyword search indexes typically grow to 1.5x-2x the original document size. Semantic search indexes can be twice that size.\\n- Chunking complexity – You need to split text into chunks because embedding quality degrades with too much input. But where do you split? Do chunks need to overlap? How do you ensure important context isn\\'t lost?\\n- Lack of transparency – With keyword search, debugging is straightforward – the tokens are human-readable, so you can understand why a document matches. You can adjust queries, field boosts, and phrase matches to tune relevance. Semantic search is opaque; if a query doesn\\'t match as expected, it\\'s hard to understand why. Fixing relevance often means training a new embedding model and reindexing everything. Ouch!\\nWouldn\\'t it be great to have the best of both worlds? We want semantic search\\'s ability to match on meaning, combined with the transparency and simplicity of traditional keyword search.\\nEnter SPLADE\\nSPLADE (Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for First Stage Ranking) was introduced in a July 2021 paper and quickly improved upon in a September follow-up. The concept is simple: instead of asking a semantic model for a meaning-carrying vector, ask it for important terms that should be in the document, whether they\\'re actually present or not. For instance, given a document containing \"ape costume,\" the model might identify similar terms like \"gorilla orangutan monkey suit clothes.\" These synthetic terms can then be indexed in a traditional search engine, boosting recall when added to the search field.\\nIn this post, we\\'ll explore how to use SPLADE to enhance your search. We\\'ll create a silly document set (because what fun is it to use a realistic example?), index it, and demonstrate how conventional search can fall short when query terms don\\'t quite match. Then, we\\'ll add SPLADE and show how it addresses this problem.\\nSetup\\nWhat\\'s your favorite superhero? Superman? Wolverine? Batman? ... Mine\\'s got to be Hindsight Lad – a computer researcher who contributed to his team by critically reviewing past decisions and explaining what they should have done instead. (Real character! Look him up!)\\nInspired by Hindsight Lad, I\\'ve chosen superheroes for our example dataset. It\\'s a simple list of superheroes including their names, true identities, descriptions, and superpowers. Here\\'s an excerpt:\\n| Name | True Identity | Description | Superpowers |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| Spider-Man | Peter Parker | A high school student bitten by a radioactive spider | Web-slinging, superhuman strength, spider-sense |\\n| Hindsight Lad | Carlton LaFroyge | A teenager with the ability to analyze past events and point out mistakes | Retroactive clairvoyance, tactical analysis of past events |\\n| Batman | Bruce Wayne | A billionaire industrialist and philanthropist | Genius-level intellect, master detective, peak human physical condition |\\n| Arm-Fall-Off Boy | Floyd Belkin | A superhero with the ability to detach his arms | Detachable arms, using detached arms as weapons (yes... another real character!) |\\n| Superman | Clark Kent | An alien from the planet Krypton | Flight, super strength, heat vision, invulnerability |\\nTo demonstrate the semantic mismatch problem, I\\'ve also generated alternative descriptions that convey the same meaning but use almost no common words:\\n| Name | Alternate Description |\\n|---|---|\\n| Spider-Man | An adolescent scholar affected by an irradiated arachnid |\\n| Hindsight Lad | A young critic gifted with retrospective wisdom |\\n| Batman | A wealthy entrepreneur and humanitarian |\\n| Arm-Fall-Off Boy | A costumed vigilante capable of limb separation |\\n| Superman | An extraterrestrial being from a distant celestial body |\\nOur curated list has just 50 heroes, so querying with alternate descriptions might work well for semantic search, but traditional information retrieval will likely struggle.\\nIndexing\\nLet\\'s demonstrate this. Here is function that will index all of our documents:\\ndef index_superheroes(num_tokens=50):\\n# Create the index with mappings\\nindex_name = \"superheroes\"\\nmappings = {\\n\"mappings\": {\\n\"dynamic\": \"false\",\\n\"properties\": {\\n\"description\": {\\n\"type\": \"text\",\\n\"analyzer\": \"english\",\\n},\\n\"splade\": {\\n\"type\": \"text\",\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n# delete and recreate the index\\nif es.indices.exists(index=index_name):\\nes.indices.delete(index=index_name)\\nprint(f\"Index \\'{index_name}\\' deleted successfully.\")\\nelse:\\nprint(f\"Index \\'{index_name}\\' does not exist.\")\\nes.indices.create(index=index_name, body=mappings)\\nprint(f\"Index \\'{index_name}\\' created successfully.\")\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\'superheroes.csv\\')\\n# Index the superheroes\\nfor i, (index, row) in enumerate(df.iterrows(), start=1):\\n# Combine the index (superhero name) with the row data\\nfull_row = pd.concat([pd.Series({\\'name\\': index}), row])\\ndoc = full_row.to_dict()\\ndoc[\\'splade\\'] = get_splade_embedding(doc[\\'description\\'], num_tokens)\\nes.index(index=index_name, id=i, body=doc)\\nprint(f\"Indexed {len(df)} superheroes.\")\\nThis script creates an index with two fields: description\\nfor superhero descriptions and splade\\nfor synthetic terms. The SPLADE content is generated by processing the description\\nthrough get_splade_embedding\\n, which we\\'ll define next:\\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM, AutoTokenizer\\nimport torch\\n# Load the SPLADE model and tokenizer\\nmodel_id = \\'naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil\\'\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\\nmodel = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(model_id)\\n# Create a mapping from token IDs to tokens\\nvocab = tokenizer.get_vocab()\\nid2token = {v: k for k, v in vocab.items()}\\ndef get_splade_embedding(text, num_tokens=50):\\n# get the tokens\\ntokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\\'pt\\')\\n# get the splade embedding\\noutput = model(**tokens)\\nvec = torch.max(\\ntorch.log(\\n1 + torch.relu(output.logits)\\n) * tokens.attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1),\\ndim=1)[0].squeeze()\\n# Convert vec to numpy for easier manipulation\\nvec_np = vec.detach().numpy()\\n# Get indices of non-zero elements\\nnon_zero_indices = vec_np.nonzero()[0]\\n# Create a list of (token, value) pairs for non-zero elements, excluding the input tokens\\ntoken_value_pairs = [\\n(id2token[idx], vec_np[idx])\\nfor idx in non_zero_indices\\nif idx not in tokens[\\'input_ids\\'][0]\\n]\\n# Sort by value in descending order\\ntoken_value_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\\nnew_tokens = [token for token, value in token_value_pairs[:num_tokens]]\\nreturn new_tokens\\nThis code is more complex, but builds on existing work. It\\'s adapted from Pinecone\\'s SPLADE writeup, with equations detailed in the SPLADEv2 paper. Essentially, it extracts tokens from input text, uses the SPLADE model to identify important terms (SPLADE tokens), filters out original tokens, converts remaining tokens to readable text, and returns the result.\\nSearching\\nWhat good is an index that can\\'t be searched? Let\\'s remedy that:\\ndef search_superheroes(description, size, splade):\\n# If SPLADE is enabled, we search both the description and SPLADE fields\\nif splade:\\n# Get SPLADE tokens for the description\\nsplade_tokens = get_tokens_as_text(description)\\nquery = {\\n\"query\": {\\n\"bool\": {\\n\"should\": [\\n{\\n\"multi_match\": {\\n\"query\": description,\\n\"fields\": [\"description\"]\\n}\\n},\\n{\\n\"multi_match\": {\\n\"query\": splade_tokens,\\n\"fields\": [\"splade\"]\\n}\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n# If SPLADE is not enabled, we only search the description field\\nelse:\\nquery = {\\n\"query\": {\\n\"multi_match\": {\\n\"query\": description,\\n\"fields\": [\"description\"]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n# Set the number of results to return\\nquery[\\'size\\'] = size\\n# Execute the search query\\nresponse = es.search(index=\"superheroes\", body=query)\\n# Extract the hits from the response\\nhits = [hit[\\'_source\\'] for hit in response[\\'hits\\'][\\'hits\\']]\\nreturn hits\\nThis function searches for superheroes based on a description (which will be drawn from our alternative\\ndescription list). When splade\\nis true, it searches both description\\nand splade\\nfields; otherwise, only the description\\nfield.\\nWe still need the get_tokens_as_text\\nfunction to convert descriptions into SPLADE tokens. Note that this doesn\\'t expand the description with synthetic terms, it simply tokenizes it:\\ndef get_tokens_as_text(text):\\ntokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\\'pt\\').input_ids[0]\\nreturn \\' \\'.join([id2token[i] for i in tokens.tolist()][1:-1])\\nNow we\\'re ready to see if this all actually works!\\nDemo Time\\nLet\\'s take the above code out for a spin.\\nFirst we index our superheroes with index_superheroes(num_tokens=50)\\n. Here we inject up to 50 SPLADE tokens for each row in our data set.\\nNext, with SPLADE turned off, let\\'s see if we can catch Iron Man using his alternative description:\\nuse_splade = false\\nhero = \"Iron Man\"\\nalt_description = hero_dict_alt[hero]\\nsearch_results = search_superheroes(alt_description, 3, use_splade)\\nresult_heroes = [result[\\'name\\'] for result in search_results]\\nprint(result_heroes)\\n[\\'Beast\\']\\nNope... that\\'s a miss! Well, after I\\'ve spent all this time writing a blog post, I hope that we can turn SPLADE back on and see Iron Man in the results.\\n[\\'Black Panther\\', \\'Iron Man\\', \\'Beast\\']\\nYay! I mean, I would have preferred that Iron Man was number 1 in the search results. But being in the top 3 results out of 50 for something as generic as \"A brilliant innovator and corporate magnate\" is not bad.\\nBut perhaps we were lucky with this example. Let\\'s create a new function recall_at_3\\nthat will run through every hero and and see if SPLADE is actually helping us improve recall.\\ndef recall_at_3(splade):\\ncounter = 0\\nfor hero in hero_dict.keys():\\nalt_description = hero_dict_alt[hero]\\nsearch_results = search_superheroes(alt_description, 3, splade)\\nresult_heroes = [result[\\'name\\'] for result in search_results]\\n# Check if the hero is in the top 3 search results\\nif hero in result_heroes:\\ncounter += 1\\n# Calculate and return the recall@3 score\\nreturn counter / len(hero_dict.keys())\\nFirst we test without SPLADE recall_at_3(False)\\nand see that the recall is 28% – as expected, not great. Now with SPLADE recall_at_3(True)\\nreturns (... drum roll please ...) 52%.\\nAlright! (Whew!) So by injecting synthetic tokens into our indexed documents we have improved recall (recall@3 to be precise) by a hefty 24%!\\nRetrospective\\nI can feel my inner Hindsight Lad jumping up and down in my head. It\\'s time to take a closer, more critical look at what we just accomplished. SPLADE is definitely neat, but it doesn\\'t fix all of the problems we\\'ve identified with semantic search.\\nWe\\'ve improved recall, but in a longer blog post (which I shall never write) we would also look at how precision changes. The problem is that sometimes the synthetic tokens produced in get_splade_embedding\\ncan be... wonky. Take a look at this example:\\nget_splade_embedding(\"mary had a little lamb, it\\'s fleece was white as snow\", 15)\\n[\\'marriage\\',\\n\\'married\\',\\n\\'winter\\',\\n\\'song\\',\\n\\'wedding\\',\\n\\'have\\',\\n\\'sheep\\',\\n\\'whites\\',\\n\\'baby\\',\\n\\'like\\',\\n\\'color\\',\\n\\'wearing\\',\\n\\'film\\',\\n\\'character\\',\\n\\'murder\\']\\nThere\\'s a lot going on here. We start off with several words related to marriage (which is not mentioned in the original song) and then right at the end it takes a darker turn with murder\\n. You know how the rest of that song goes, and these words are clearly a miss. There are also a couple of stop words (super common words) in there: have\\n, and like\\n. This will definitely increase recall as it will match about half of the docs in the index, but this will take it\\'s toll on precision.\\nNext, my SPLADE implementation in Elasticsearch is oversimplified. If you scroll back up to get_splade_embedding\\n, we extract non-zero elements from vec_np\\n(the SPLADE tokens) but discard their associated weights. This is a missed opportunity. The SPLADE papers use these weights for scoring matches. Incorporating this nuance – for instance, the fact that murder is less relevant to Mary than sheep, song, baby, and white – would significantly enhance precision.\\nFinally, one of the problems with semantic search that we were trying to avoid is the complexity of dealing with the embedding model when it doesn\\'t quite do what you want it to do. When an embedding model doesn\\'t match the correct documents, then your only option is to retrain the model, reindex, and hope. But with SPLADE, if it thinks that Mary likes murder, our options aren\\'t much better. The main benefit of SPLADE in this case is that you can actually see the words produced by the model, (rather than an opaque vector). This will make it easier to debug the problem and improve it. ... Maybe SPLADE\\'s training data had too many references to Mary I of England (you know... \"Bloody Mary\").\\nConclusion\\nSPLADE is a promising approach that bridges the gap between traditional keyword search and modern semantic search. And this is a good thing! In many ways, good ol\\' keyword search is the right tool because it\\'s relatively simple, it\\'s well understood, and it\\'s easy to scale and maintain. But traditional keyword search still falls short when it comes to matching on meaning.\\nThis post is begging for follow-up posts:\\n- How does my implementation of SPLADE+Elasticsearch affect precision?\\n- How does semantic search perform against my implementation of SPLADE+Elasticsearch?\\n- Can we improve SPLADE+Elasticsearch? I want to see how tough it is to get the SPLADE weights into the Elasticsearch scoring.\\n- Did you know that Elasticsearch offers a SPLADE-like solution called ESLER? I wonder how that compares with the solution presented here.\\nIf you\\'re interested in hearing more about this topic, then let me know.

Who will train the next generation of workers? - CNA\\nSocial card title: Commentary: AI is taking entry-level jobs. Who will train the next generation of workers?\\nSocial card description: There\\'s a danger to letting artificial intelligence and automation fill up roles traditionally used to teach junior workers the ropes, says tech writer Darwin Gosal.\\nCommentary: AI is taking entry-level jobs. Who will train the next generation of workers?\\nThere\\'s a danger to letting artificial intelligence and automation fill up roles traditionally used to teach junior workers the ropes, says tech writer Darwin Gosal.\\nSINGAPORE: When DBS Group announced in February that artificial intelligence (AI) could cut up to 4,000 contract and temporary jobs at the bank over the next few years, it spotlighted a growing concern.\\nAcross industries from marketing to finance to software, AI is automating the “ground floor” of careers – the very roles used to teach workers the ropes.\\nTHE VANISHING GROUND FLOOR\\nCareers are not downloaded fully formed; they are built through hands-on experience, structured learning and mentorship – a foundation that’s rapidly eroding.\\nJunior employees have traditionally learnt by doing foundational work. Writers edited press releases. Designers created social media graphics. Programmers fixed bugs and wrote tests. Learning was embedded in the job itself.\\nToday, companies increasingly use ChatGPT to draft content, Midjourney to design visuals, and GitHub Copilot to generate code. While impressive, these tools are also removing crucial learning opportunities.\\nA 2023 ResumeBuilder survey found that 37 per cent of US companies had already replaced workers with ChatGPT, and 44 per cent were planning more replacements. AI could automate 25 per cent of current work tasks globally, affecting 300 million jobs, reported Goldman Sachs the same year.\\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore in 2019 projected that one in three finance jobs in Singapore alone could be transformed or eliminated by automation.\\nTHE COMPETENCE GAP\\nAI-generated work often appears polished but may lack the technical or critical depth of human judgment and expertise. Without foundational training, junior employees risk becoming dependent on tools they cannot truly assess or evaluate.\\nResearch from MIT and Stanford shows AI-assisted workers complete tasks 40 per cent faster – but their work often requires more revision by seniors.\\nA copywriter using ChatGPT might not understand why one tagline lands while another falls flat. A developer relying on code generators may be lost when systems break in ways the AI is unable to foresee or account for.\\nThis creates a dangerous illusion: the work is completed faster and largely looks good, but true competence and understanding are missing. If entry-level roles become performative – driven by prompting rather than critical thinking – we risk building a future where nobody truly knows how things work.\\nLOSING HUMAN JUDGMENT\\nBesides technical competence, the disappearance of entry-level jobs threatens the development of critical thinking and nuanced judgment.\\nEntry-level positions traditionally allow young professionals to understand company culture, learn from making mistakes in relatively low-stakes scenarios, and develop soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and resilience.\\nThese soft skills – critical for future leadership – cannot be automated. Yet, without junior roles that explicitly teach and nurture these abilities, the next generation risks entering senior positions technically capable but lacking essential interpersonal and strategic skills.\\nTHE EQUITY CHALLENGE\\nThis shift particularly affects students and young workers from less privileged backgrounds.\\nPreviously, on-the-job training helped level the playing field. However, if entry-level positions now demand pre-existing expertise without offering learning opportunities, those without industry connections face significant barriers.\\nWe are already seeing this play out in rising unpaid internships and portfolio expectations. According to a 2024 National Youth Council survey, 68 per cent of young job seekers in Singapore reported that internship experience is now considered \"essential\" rather than \"preferred\" for entry-level positions.\\nWhen only those who can \"fake it\" with AI tools or secure mentorship through personal networks are considered hireable, we narrow both the diversity and depth of future talent.\\nA STRUCTURED SOLUTION\\nSingapore could consider responding by launching a national apprenticeship scheme – building on the SGUnited Traineeships programme from COVID-19, but retooled for the AI age.\\nSuch a scheme could:\\n• Offer 12–24 month paid placements for fresh graduates, polytechnic and ITE students\\n• Emphasise AI-augmented work with real mentorship\\n• Include structured feedback, not just key performance indicators to hit\\n• Encourage mentorship from senior employees explicitly, recognising and rewarding their role in shaping future talent.\\nCountries with similar programmes have seen promising outcomes. Germany’s dual-track system keeps youth unemployment at 5.7 per cent – well below the European Union average of 14.5 per cent.\\nSingapore’s SkillsFuture Earn and Learn scheme boasts a 93 per cent job placement rate in technical fields. It is time to extend this success to knowledge work too.\\nBUILDING LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE\\nHowever, unlike the SG Traineeships programme, this cannot be a temporary patch. AI isn’t a crisis to outlast – it’s a shift to outsmart. We need new systems to grow talent in a world where doing the task is not always how you learn it anymore.\\nThis is not about Gen Z being “lazy” or a lack of talent. It’s about a system that’s no longer structured to produce mastery. Apprenticeships are not a nostalgic idea; they are a practical response.\\nResearch across various industries shows that many seniors are willing to mentor, but cannot do so without structure. If we can build apprenticeship into our workflows, we strengthen learning and loyalty for both senior and junior workers.\\nCompanies also benefit from higher-quality talent pipelines, and employees from gaining valuable, marketable skills.\\nGovernments, educational institutions and private companies must collaborate to establish frameworks that institutionalise learning in the age of AI. Curriculum updates should integrate AI literacy alongside human judgment, ethics, and creativity, preparing students not just to leverage AI but to question and guide its responsible use.\\nSINGAPORE\\'S STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY\\nFor decades, Singapore has thrived on a shared, unspoken promise: work hard, play by the rules, and you’ll be rewarded. Our success has never been just about gross domestic product. It was about building trust – between citizen and state, worker and employer.\\nThis has made Singapore one of the world\\'s safest, most developed nations despite our lack of natural resources. It explains our reliable public transport, clean streets, and globally competitive schools.\\nShould young Singaporeans lose faith in the social contract that promises effort will lead to growth and reward, our collective trust will erode.\\nIf AI is here to stay – and it is – we must ensure human judgment, mentorship, and mastery remain integral to our workforce. This approach safeguards not just our economy but our identity as a society committed to advancement for all.\\nThis isn’t charity. It’s a long-term investment in capability. No matter how powerful the tools in our kit become, we still need to know how – and when – to use them well.\\nIt starts with someone willing to teach – and someone given a real chance to learn.\\nDarwin Gosal is a product manager in Singapore’s public sector and a former tech startup founder.

An AI-powered delivery platform today allows consultants to integrate AI seamlessly into their tasks, from refining business cases to generating code, thus delivering faster and smarter solutions.\\nPRODUCTIVITY BOOSTER\\nRather than replacing consultants, AI makes them even more essential. Today, more than 2,000 AI assistants and agents have already been created by IBM consultants, supporting tasks from project management and software testing to industry-specific problem solving.\\nWith this transformation, productivity gains of 50% have been achieved across core consulting tasks, accelerating time to value for clients and ushering in a new era of consulting delivery.\\nThe journey doesn\\'t stop here -- the goal is to move beyond traditional consulting towards a more scalable, technology-enhanced service delivery model in which AI plays a central role in shaping the services provided.\\nConsultants as AI creators mark a fundamental shift from traditional consulting to a \"people plus AI\" model -- paving the way for a service-as-software approach.\\nDOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONSULTING\\nBusinesses are increasingly seeking consultants who can use AI to deliver greater precision and speed in problem-solving. Consulting firms that integrate AI are well-positioned as trusted partners to help organisations navigate transformation.\\nIn fact, organisations are demanding AI-powered consulting, and they are voting with their wallets. According to the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV), 75% of consulting buyers expect AI to positively impact their consulting engagements, while 86% report they\\'re actively looking for services that incorporate AI and technology assets.\\nAs AI becomes more transformational, it is also growing increasingly specialised -- particularly in areas like human resources, finance and customer service. As the future lies in seamlessly blending people and technology, fostering collaboration across domain-specific AI, consulting firms that integrate AI are positioned as trusted partners who can help organisations navigate transformation.\\nRather than replacing consultants, AI is complementing human expertise. The human+digital labour model highlights how AI can amplify consultants\\' capabilities, as seen in our work with Riyadh Air, Saudi Arabia\\'s new, digitally born national airline.\\nUsing AI agents, pre-built industry accelerators and proprietary methods, the team rapidly built a cutting-edge mobile app that enhances customer experience while reducing time to market. AI agents also played a key role in helping IBM consultants; defining app requirements, coding functionalities and conducting rigorous testing.\\nOther success stories illustrate the tangible value of AI-powered consulting. In a recent call centre transformation, AI-powered digital workers now handle five million out of 45 million annual customer interactions -- significantly improving customer satisfaction scores while reducing operational costs.\\nIn Asia Pacific, AI agents is also being piloted with a government\\'s technology arm to enhance service delivery and citizen experience.\\nTHE FUTURE OF CONSULTING\\nWhether it\\'s accelerating time-to-value, improving customer acquisition, or reducing operational overhead, the consulting industry is shifting towards prioritising AI-driven business outcomes. By combining industry expertise, scalable IP assets and AI-powered delivery, organisations can drive speed, scale and repeatable transformation that deliver measurable results.\\nAs consulting firms continue to support clients around the world -- from global banks to major players across automotive, telecoms, local consumer goods, healthcare, and beyond -- the message is clear: the future of consulting is not about replacing human consultants, but unleashing a new class of hybrid consulting engagements where humans and digital labour work side by side -- accelerating innovation while maintaining the human touch that clients still value.\\nJuhi McClelland is managing partner of IBM Consulting Asia Pacific.'}\n",

Since DeepSeek is open source, anybody can download the model, store it on their own servers, and offer it to their clients without sending the data back to China.\\nThat, however, doesn’t remove other risks like the model spreading propaganda or generating insecure code.\\nDuring the Senate hearing, Smith said that Microsoft had managed to go inside DeepSeek’s AI model and “change” it to remove “harmful side effects.” Microsoft did not elaborate on exactly what it did to DeepSeek’s model, referring TechCrunch to Smith’s remarks.\\nIn its initial launch of DeepSeek on Azure, Microsoft wrote that DeepSeek underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before it was put on Azure.\\nWhile we can’t help pointing out that DeepSeek’s app is also a direct competitor to Microsoft’s own Copilot internet search chat app, Microsoft doesn’t ban all such chat competitors from its Windows app store.\\nPerplexity is available in the Windows app store, for instance.

Now, ChatGPT deep research can link to GitHub (in beta), allowing developers to ask questions about a codebase and engineering documents.\\nThe connector will be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users over the next few days, with Enterprise and Edu support coming soon, according to an OpenAI spokesperson.\\nThe GitHub connector for ChatGPT deep research arrives as AI companies look to make their AI-powered chatbots more useful by building ways to link them to outside platforms and services. Anthropic, for example, recently debuted Integrations, which gives apps a pipeline into its AI chatbot Claude.\\nOpenAI years ago offered a plug-in capability for ChatGPT, but deprecated it in favor of custom chatbots called GPTs.\\n“I often hear that users find ChatGPT’s deep research agent so valuable that they want it to connect to their internal sources, in addition to the web,” OpenAI Head of Business Products Nate Gonzalez wrote in a blog post on LinkedIn. “[That’s why] today we’re introducing our first connector.”\\nIn addition to answering questions about codebases, the new ChatGPT deep research GitHub connector lets ChatGPT users break down product specs into technical tasks and dependencies, summarize code structure and patterns, and understand how to implement new APIs using real code examples.\\nTechcrunch event\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

But OpenAI is pitching the new capability as a potential time saver, not a replacement for experts.\\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said ChatGPT will respect an organization’s settings so users only see GitHub content they’re already allowed to view and codebases that’ve been explicitly shared with ChatGPT.\\nOpenAI has been investing in its tooling for assistive coding, recently unveiling an open source coding tool for terminals called Codex CLI and upgrading the ChatGPT desktop app to read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps. The company sees programming as a top use case for its models. Case in point, OpenAI has reportedly reached an agreement to buy AI-powered coding assistant Windsurf for $3 billion.\\nIn other OpenAI news on Thursday, the company launched fine-tuning options for developers looking to customize its newer models for particular applications. Devs can now fine-tune OpenAI’s o4-mini “reasoning” model via a technique OpenAI calls reinforcement fine-tuning, which uses task-specific grading to improve the model’s performance. Fine-tuning has also rolled out for the company’s GPT-4.1 nano model.\\nOnly verified organizations can fine-tune o4-mini, according to OpenAI. GPT-4.1 nano fine-tuning, meanwhile, is available for all paying developers.\\nOpenAI began gating certain models and developer features behind verification, which requires organizations to submit an ID and other identity documents, in April.

The company is scrambling to protect its search empire, but perhaps market forces could pull the rug out from under Google before the government can. Apple SVP of Services Eddie Cue suggested in his testimony on Wednesday that Google's search traffic might be falling. Not so fast, says Google.\\nIn an unusual move, Google issued a statement late in the day after Cue's testimony to dispute the implication that it may already be losing its monopoly. During questioning by DOJ attorney Adam Severt, Cue expressed concern about losing the Google search deal, which is a major source of revenue for Apple. This contract, along with a similar one for Firefox, gives Google default search placement in exchange for a boatload of cash. The DOJ contends that is anticompetitive, and its proposed remedies call for banning Google from such deals.\\nSurprisingly, Cue noted in his testimony that search volume in Safari fell for the first time ever in April. Since Google is the default search provider, that implies fewer Google searches. Apple devices are popular, and a drop in Google searches there could be a bad sign for the company's future competitiveness. Google's statement on this comes off as a bit defensive.\"}\n",

AI’s increasing capabilities have made the “magic cycle” of research from breakthrough to real-world impact broader and quicker than ever.\\nAI is an amplifier of human ingenuity. At Google, our teams are using AI to address fundamental scientific questions and push the boundaries of what’s possible, leading to new understanding of life and novel solutions to humanity’s greatest challenges. As we accelerate scientific discovery, we collaborate closely with the scientific community and ecosystem, across both industry and academia, and make our tech and tools available to our partners for their own research.\\nHere are four areas where Google Research has shared recent breakthroughs with meaningful scientific and societal impact.\\nAdvancing biomedical science to better treat disease\\nWe’re excited about the potential of AI to personalize medicine, democratize science and open up new avenues for biological and medical discovery. Our AI co-scientist aims to help expedite the process of making new biomedical discoveries. This multi-agent system uses AI’s ability to synthesize information and perform complex reasoning tasks to aid scientists in creating novel hypotheses and research proposals using natural language.\\nWe recently introduced a multimodal version of AMIE, a research AI agent for medical diagnostic conversations published in Nature. It can intelligently interpret and reason about visual medical information, working towards more accurate diagnosis. AMIE builds upon our earlier work on MedPaLM and subsequent language models fine-tuned for the medical domain. We continue to add assets to Health AI Developer Foundations to help developers build medical AI applications and we released TxGemma, a collection of open models designed to improve the efficiency of therapeutic development, building on our embeddings models for chest x-rays, digital pathology and dermatology.\\nWe keep advancing research into genomics, too, to better understand individuals' genetic predispositions to illnesses and to diagnose rare diseases. REGLE is an unsupervised deep learning model that helps researchers discover associations with genetic variants. And we open sourced new DeepVariant models as part of a collaboration on Personalized Pangenome References, which can reduce errors by 30% when analyzing genomes of diverse ancestries.\\nAdvancing neuroscience research to demystify the brain\\nOver the past decade, we’ve made fundamental contributions to the field of connectomics and furthered scientific understanding of the workings of the brain. Just yesterday in Nature, a team from Google Research and ISTA published on LICONN, the first-ever method for using commonly available light microscopes to comprehensively map neurons and their connections in brain tissue. LICONN will enable more labs around the world to pursue connectomics studies.\\nBuilding beyond neural connections, in collaboration with HHMI Janelia and Harvard, we introduced the Zebrafish Activity Prediction Benchmark (ZAPBench) with recordings of more than 70,000 neurons from the entire brain of the larval zebrafish. This allows researchers to investigate the relationship between the structural wiring and dynamic neural activity across an entire vertebrate brain for the first time. We’ve open-sourced the dataset and benchmark to help neuroscientists develop more accurate brain activity models.\\nWe’ve also explored the similarities and differences in how the human brain and deep language models process natural language through a series of studies in collaboration with Princeton University, NYU and HUJI. Our findings indicate that deep learning models could offer a new computational framework for understanding the brain's neural code.\\nAdvancing geospatial science to tackle planet-scale challenges\\nGoogle Research is also accelerating geospatial problem solving by making critical information more accessible. We recently launched the first FireSat satellite to help address wildfires. As we expand the constellation to more than 50 satellites, the high-resolution imagery, updated globally every 20 minutes, will help emergency responders detect wildfires at an earlier stage and help scientists understand how wildfires spread. We’ve also driven climate resilience and crisis response with our advanced AI models for Flood Forecasting and WeatherNext models.\\nGeospatial Reasoning is a new research effort that seeks to combine the power of our geospatial foundation models with generative AI to uncover powerful and actionable information — all through a simple conversational interface. It builds on prior models including those for floods, wildfires and weather, as well as Open Buildings and SKAI models and expands our previous Population Dynamics and trajectory-based mobility foundational models. Geospatial Reasoning can be a critical tool for advancing public health, urban planning, integrated business planning, climate science and more.\\nAdvancing quantum computing towards real-world applications\\nFor more than a decade, we’ve been making progress toward building large-scale quantum computers that can solve otherwise impossible problems. Our new Willow chip is a major milestone, demonstrating error correction and state-of-the-art performance. On World Quantum Day, we highlighted how it’s bringing us closer to real-world applications. For example, in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories, we demonstrated that a quantum algorithm could more efficiently simulate the mechanisms needed for sustained fusion reactions. This could help make fusion energy a reality, with its potential for clean energy at scale. We continue to advance our quantum research, and recently shared a novel hybrid approach to quantum simulation that paves the way for further scientific discoveries.\\nThe promise of AI is now becoming a reality across scientific disciplines. We’ll continue to ask the biggest questions and address challenges that were previously unsolvable in pursuit of scientific breakthroughs that can benefit billions.\"}\n",
      "async_langchain: 35, {'article': 'Page title: Introducing Model Router: iterate quickly with seamless access to models – Hypermode\\nSocial card title: Introducing Model Router: iterate quickly with seamless access to models\\nSocial card description: Connect to open-source and commercial AI models with one API. Hypermode’s Model Router simplifies orchestration across LLMs and embedding models\\nMAY 6 2025\\nIntroducing Model Router: iterate quickly with seamless access to models\\nConnect to open-source and commercial AI models with one API. Hypermode’s Model Router simplifies orchestration across LLMs and embedding models\\nFrontier and specialized models are advancing every day. Developers now have an unprecedented array of models to choose from, each optimized for different tasks, budgets, and performance requirements based on the specific use case. But integrating multiple models into an app remains unnecessarily complex—until now.\\nToday, we’re excited to introduce Model Router, a powerful new feature in Hypermode that enables developers to connect to both open-source and commercial language models through a single, unified API. Model Router lets you use the SDKs and tools you already know and love, while giving you full flexibility to switch between different models—all while maintaining a developer-first, composable experience.\\nGrowing use cases accelerate model proliferation\\nAs AI capabilities expand, so do the options for developers. With open-source models like LLaMA and DeepSeek, and competing with commercial offerings like OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, developers often find themselves juggling multiple APIs, SDKs, and pricing structures.\\nThat complexity isn’t limited to reasoning models. Embedding models, which power vector search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and recommendation systems, also come with significant fragmentation. But these models aren’t interchangeable: they produce different vector representations, making it difficult to switch between providers without retraining or recalibrating downstream systems.\\nEach provider comes with its own integration requirements, hidden switching costs, and operational trade-offs, making it difficult to easily experiment with different models, optimize for cost, or dynamically route requests based on performance without managing a series of subscriptions.\\nHowever, with the adoption of the OpenAI-compatible API standard by model providers, developers can use familiar SDKs with entirely different backends to access model inputs and outputs. This open schema is the first step in managing the fragmentation and rapid proliferation of models, which often results in increased development complexity, higher maintenance costs, and limited agility in adapting to the latest breakthroughs in AI research.\\nIntroducing Model Router\\nModel Router eliminates these pain points by providing a single API that connects to a diverse set of AI models. Instead of managing multiple API integrations, developers can use Model Router to:\\n- Seamlessly switch between open-source and commercial models based on performance, pricing, or availability.\\n- Optimize costs by routing requests to the most cost-effective models for a given task.\\n- Enhance reliability with automatic fallback mechanisms in case of API outages or rate limits.\\n- Experiment and iterate faster by dynamically selecting different models without rewriting application logic.\\nWith Model Router, you get the flexibility to choose the best AI model for the job—whether it’s a powerful commercial model for production workloads or an open-source model for cost-efficient experimentation.\\nKey features include:\\n- Unified API access: One integration point for multiple AI models, reducing development overhead.\\n- Fallback & load balancing: Improve reliability by distributing requests across multiple models and providers.\\n- Customizable model preferences: Prioritize specific models or providers based on business needs.\\n- Cost & performance optimization: Select models dynamically to optimize for both budget and response time.\\n- Security & compliance: Maintain control over data privacy and compliance by choosing region-specific models when necessary.\\n- Developer agility: Directly access Model Router through the OpenAI SDK, Vercel AI SDK, and Modus SDK for fine-grained control and iteration.\\nWhy Model Router matters\\nWhile model innovation is accelerating, swapping one model for another isn’t as simple as updating an API key. In reality, developers face hidden costs: differences in tokenization, output structures, system prompt behavior, and embedding representations often require significant downstream adjustments. Migrating between models without an orchestration layer can introduce quality regressions, additional maintenance burden, and slow down iteration velocity.\\nThough models may never be completely interchangeable, the ability to seamlessly integrate multiple models will be a competitive advantage. Model Router allows for fast iteration by providing a unified API to simplify development—allowing you to test, tune, and deploy across models without incurring hidden switching costs. It abstracts away low-level differences while giving organizations full control over settings and behavior.\\nBy providing a single API for a diverse AI ecosystem, Model Router unlocks new possibilities for developers and enterprises alike. Instead of being locked into a single provider, you can harness the full spectrum of AI innovation while maintaining flexibility and control over your infrastructure.\\nGet started\\nIt is easy to get started with Model Router. In the Hypermode Console, generate an API key and drop it into your favorite framework. Check out the Hypermode Docs for additional details.\\nFor example, in the Vercel AI SDK, you can call a hosted model.\\nimport { createOpenAI } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\"\\nimport { generateText } from \"ai\"\\n// Configure with your Hypermode Workspace API key and Hypermode Model Router base url\\nconst hypermode = createOpenAI({\\nname: \"hypermode\",\\napiKey: \"<YOUR_HYP_WKS_KEY>\",\\nbaseURL: \"https://models.hypermode.host/v1\",\\n})\\nasync function generateHoliday() {\\ntry {\\nconst { text, usage, providerMetadata } = await generateText({\\nmodel: hypermode(\"o3-mini\"),\\nprompt: \"Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.\",\\nproviderOptions: { hypermode: { reasoningEffort: \"low\" } },\\n})\\n// Print the response\\nconsole.log(text)\\nreturn { text, usage, providerMetadata }\\n} catch (error) {\\nconsole.error(\"Error generating text:\", error)\\nthrow error\\n}\\n}\\n// Call the function\\ngenerateHoliday()\\nYou can also access the API directly.\\nimport requests\\nimport json\\n# Your Hypermode Workspace API key\\napi_key = \"<YOUR_HYP_WKS_KEY>\"\\n# Use the Hypermode Model Router base url\\nbase_url = \"https://models.hypermode.host/v1\"\\n# API endpoint\\nendpoint = f\"{base_url}/chat/completions\"\\n# Headers\\nheaders = {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\"}\\n# Request payload\\npayload = {\\n\"model\": \"meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct\",\\n\"messages\": [\\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is Dgraph?\"},\\n],\\n\"max_tokens\": 150,\\n\"temperature\": 0.7,\\n}\\n# Make the API request\\nresponse = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))\\n# Check if the request was successful\\nif response.status_code == 200:\\n# Parse and print the response\\nresponse_data = response.json()\\nprint(response_data[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\\nelse:\\n# Print error information\\nprint(f\"Error: {response.status_code}\")\\nprint(response.text)\\nThe future of AI is open, flexible, and interoperable\\nModel Router is now available in Hypermode, bringing the next level of AI model orchestration to developers worldwide.

While it named potential frontrunners like Parolin, Tagle, Zuppi, Turkson, and Pizzaballa, it emphasized that the selection hinges on deeper traits.\\n“The cardinals look for a leader with strong faith, humility, and adherence to the Church’s teachings,” it said, also citing the importance of “pastoral experience,” “administrative skills,” and “a clear sense of direction for the future of Catholicism.”\\nGemini noted the unpredictability of papal elections, reminding users that while some candidates may seem likely, “history shows that unexpected candidates can emerge as the next leader of the Catholic Church.”\\nMicrosoft’s Copilot kept its comments short and understated, identifying Parolin and Tagle as frontrunners while noting the broader significance of geographic representation.\\n“There is also speculation that the next pope could come from Africa or Asia,” it said. “Some experts believe this could signal a shift toward a more global representation in leadership.”\\nUltimately, Copilot concluded, “the outcome remains uncertain.”\\nMeta’s chatbot took a methodical approach, dividing candidates into tiers.\\nUnder “Top Contenders,” it listed Péter Erdő, Mario Grech, and Pietro Parolin. Among “Other Notable Candidates,” it named Robert Sarah, Luis Antonio Tagle, Peter Turkson, and Matteo Zuppi.\\nMeta advised readers to consider each contender’s “experience, vision, global perspective, and leadership style.”\\nIt noted Parolin’s diplomatic strengths, Zuppi’s mediating experience, and Tagle’s alignment with Francis, while also pointing out potential drawbacks, such as age or lack of pastoral experience.\\nPerplexity AI offered one of the more data-driven responses, citing recent news reports, betting odds, and expert commentary. It described Parolin as “the main favorite,” followed by Erdő, Aveline, and Pizzaballa. It also emphasized that 80% of voting cardinals were appointed by Pope Francis, adding that they “represent a range of views, not a monolith.”\\n“The new pope will face significant geopolitical and internal Church challenges,” the chatbot noted, including “relations with China and managing the Church’s financial and doctrinal issues.”\\nAdvertisement\\nStrictly necessary cookies are essential for the website to function correctly.

It\\'s free training on a hot topic from a well-respected company, so it\\'s definitely worth checking out.\\nPrizes and discounts\\nIf you don\\'t want to pay for certifications, you may be in luck. If you enter the Microsoft AI Skills Fest Challenge Sweepstakes (another name I couldn\\'t make up), you could win one of 50,000 free certification vouchers awarded during weekly drawings.\\nGitHub is offering a 50% discount code for GitHub\\'s newest certification exam, GitHub Copilot. Once you finish the GitHub Learn module, you\\'ll be given a discount code, which will be valid until May 28, 2025. To make sure you don\\'t dilly or dally, you must complete the exam by June 30, 2025.\\nMy experiences with Skills Fest\\nI dug into a few of the classes. When you register, you\\'ll get a long list of classes and trainings. I looked at three of them. I started with Minecraft Education - AI Adventurers because my friends say I have the maturity of a 12-year-old. It was a short series of videos. All of them were charming and very well suited to kids. If you have a child and you want to explain AI, this is a great place to start.\\nNext up was Building applications with GitHub Copilot agent mode. This one is a 45-minute YouTube video that takes you through the full stack development process of creating a fitness tracker app using GitHub Copilot\\'s new agent mode.\\nAlso: I tested 10 AI content detectors - and these 5 correctly identified AI text every time\\nThe Microsoft presenter, Chris Noring, showed off Agent mode and demonstrated building the app using VS Code in GitHub Codespaces. I really liked how he walked through more than just the AI process and integrated it in with React, Django, and a MongoDB database. Very informative, all in about 45 minutes.\\nThe third class I took was AI for Organizational Leaders, produced by LinkedIn Learning. You may not be able to get access to this unless you come in either via your LinkedIn account or the Skills Fest.\\nIt\\'s a quick 57-minute class on the details of AI technology, the business implications of generative AI, where AI fits into your business strategy, and a very important section on pitfalls, concerns, and limits of AI technology. Each of the five main chapters is punctuated by a short quiz, and there\\'s a 10-question final exam. The result is a nice certificate, suitable for framing. I paid no fee to get the certificate, which is also cool.\\nAn interesting note is that many of the classes and trainings listed in Skills Fest aren\\'t gated, so you can do them even after the Skills Fest ended. The Minecraft series, for example, is reachable by anyone with the link, as is the GitHub YouTube video.\\nA Guinness World Record\\nMicrosoft began the Skills Fest event in April with a big goal: to win a world record. And they did it, too. The previous holder for the title of \"most users to take an online multi-level artificial intelligence lesson in 24 hours\" was GUVI Geek Network Private Limited in collaboration with the Government of Uttar Pradesh, India, who pulled in 46,045 online participants.\\nMicrosoft and all the Skills Fest participants beat that with a total of 126,151 participants. Jeana Jorgensen, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Learning said, \"The record is a tribute to every person who is investing their time and energy to learn a new AI skill or help others build their AI expertise.\"\\nAlso: How Bill Gates, the Altair 8800, and BASIC propelled me into the PC revolution\\nAre you planning on registering for the AI Skills Fest?

Before, you had to search quite specifically. For example, I would have to search for ‘AI Editor’ to find the role I wanted.\\nThis, however, will then pigeonhole you, only offering jobs with that exact title. This would miss out on any other similar jobs like AI writer, or if a company wanted to take some extravagant route with a job title like ‘AI dreamer’ or ‘AI storyteller’.\\nThe way this new search works is similar to Google or ChatGPT. Think of it more like a request. So I could type “A job where I can work remotely in the UK while writing about AI at a senior level”.\\nThis kind of search would have left LinkedIn dazed and confused before, but now it actually understands. While it didn’t return any jobs that fit exactly what I wanted, it did understand the prompt — only offering senior remote jobs in the AI space.\\nI then tried the search for other jobs (albeit ones I’m completely unqualified for). “Astrophysics jobs on a senior level in Los Angeles” returned a long list of astrophysics jobs as well as similar roles in that area.\\nYou can also try searches that are more vague, such as “I like talking to people and working in busy environments. I have a university degree and training in communications, what jobs can I do in London?”. This returned a long list of jobs in London that fit these requirements.\\nThe search is still in beta and is quite often either confused or just filling in the gaps when there is no role available. For example, when I asked for “a job working with animals in the South West of England”, it offered me roles as a care home manager, life insurance positions, and an app developer. It did, however, work when I tried the same search but in London.\\nHow qualified am I?\\nAnother new part of LinkedIn, powered by AI, is the job match function. This is a small bar that says how matched you are to a job, ranging from low to high. You can then ask which details of your account match the jobs and ask for tips to better fit the role.\\nThis is pretty hit and miss. For example, I got a high match to a job as the manager of Human Rights Risks and Sustainability Due Diligence at Lego – a job that I am completely unqualified for. And yet, I was a low match for my last job that I did for multiple years.\\nIs it worth the upgrade?\\nLinkedIn’s new features are fun and can be quite useful. However, for the price of LinkedIn Premium, these tools are not enough to be worth the upgrade.\\nLuckily, LinkedIn Premium comes with a bunch of other tools. These are just a nice topping for people on the job hunt who want to make things a little bit easier.\\nMore from Tom\\'s Guide\\n- How to make and run your own AI models for free\\n- Google Gemini finally has an iPad app — better late than never\\n- Apple agrees to $95 million Siri settlement — here’s how to claim your share\\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom\\'s Guide direct to your inbox.\\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\\nAlex is the AI editor at TomsGuide.

But the animatronic has raised ethical questions on whether such creations are exploitative.\\nIt \\'keeps Walt alive in the medium he pioneered\\': Imagineers defend new Walt Disney robot\\n\"It\\'s kind of fun to do the impossible.\" That\\'s one of Walt Disney\\'s most popular quotes, often used in the context of the theme park marvels imagined by the company he created.\\nOver the decades Walt Disney Imagineering, the secretive arm of the Walt Disney Co. devoted to theme park experiences, has dreamed up a room full of singing birds and flowers, brought to life a mini New Orleans, captured the idealism of space flight and re-envisioned modern transportation, to name just a few of its many varied accomplishments.\\nFor its latest trick, Imagineering will attempt to resurrect a life of sorts, that is to fully animate a highly accurate robotic creation of one of the most recognizable figures of the 20th century, Walt Disney himself. First unveiled last summer at the company\\'s fan convention D23, the goal, said Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D\\'Amaro at the event, is to capture \"what it would have been like to be in Walt’s presence.”\\nThat means finding a middle ground between romanticism and realism.\\nOn Wednesday morning, Imagineering previewed for a select group of media the upcoming show \"Walt Disney — A Magical Life,\" set to premiere July 17 to coincide with Disneyland\\'s official 70th anniversary, when it will temporarily displace an attraction centered on a robotic Abraham Lincoln. An early sculpt of what would become the animatronic was revealed, one complete with age spots on Disney\\'s hands and weariness around his eyes — Imagineers stressed their intent is faithful accuracy — but much of the attraction remains secretive. The animatronic wasn\\'t shown, nor did Imagineering provide any images of the figure, which it promises will be one of its most technically advanced.\\nInstead, Imagineering sought to show the care in which it was bringing Disney back to life while also attempting to assuage any fears regarding what has become a much-debated project among the Disney community. When D\\'Amaro unveiled \"A Magical Life\" last summer, he did so noting he had the support of the Disney family, singling out Disney\\'s grandnephew, Roy P. Disney, who was in the audience.\\nYet soon a social media missive critical of the attraction from Walt\\'s granddaughter would go viral. It raised anew ethical questions that often surround any project attempting to capture the dead via technology, be it holographic representations of performers or digitally re-created cinematic animations, namely debates surrounding the wishes of the deceased and whether such creations are exploitative. \"Dehumanizing,\" wrote Joanna Miller in her Facebook post on the figure.\\nRead more: He worked with Walt Disney to shape Disneyland. Now at 93, boy, does he have stories\\nThe animatronic somewhat represents a shift in thinking for the Walt Disney Co., as the majority of its robotic figures are representations of fictional characters or overly-saturated political figures such as those in Florida\\'s Hall of Presidents, in which new politicians are added while they are living. Arguably, the Walt Disney Co. first tested the public\\'s willingness to embrace a resurrected Disney via a holographic-like projection for its touring \"Disney 100: The Exhibition,\" which initially raised some eyebrows.\\nLongtime Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald, known for his work on beloved Disney projects such as Star Tours and the Guardians of the Galaxy coaster in Florida, said Wednesday that \"A Magical Life\" has been in the works for about seven years. Asked directly about ethical concerns in representing the deceased via a robotic figurine, Fitzgerald noted the importance of the Walt Disney story, not only to the company but to culture at large.\\n\"His life story had been told in these other formats already,\" Fitzgerald says, referencing the film \"Walt Disney: One Man\\'s Dream,\" which currently airs at Florida\\'s Hollywood Studios. \"What could we do at Disneyland for our audience that would be part of our tool kit vernacular but that would bring Walt to life in a way that you could only experience at the park? We felt the technology had gotten there. We felt there was a need to tell that story in a fresh way.\"\\nDisneyland, in contrast to the company\\'s other parks around the globe, places a premium on historical attractions, in part because it\\'s the only park Disney walked in. The park\\'s patriarch even had a small apartment on Main Street, U.S.A., in which he would occasionally spend the night. After its initial run during the 70th celebration, \"A Magical Life\" will play in tandem with “Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln” thanks to a newly constructed revolving stage. A new pre-show gallery will feature a mini-re-creation of Disney\\'s apartment and also unveil some never-before-seen artifacts, such as early master plans of Disneyland.\\nRead more: Everything you need to know about Disneyland\\'s biggest event of the decade\\nThe figure, essentially, was created in part to anticipate criticism. Fitzgerald notes modern audiences, with the ability to zoom in on a character via smartphone, are far more discerning. The animatronic will aim to represent Disney in 1963. Disney died in 1966 at 65.\\n\"He needs to be able to speak with his hands. Hands, very important,\" Fitzgerald says. \"When you watch Walt Disney talking, he\\'s very expressive with his hands when he talks. He also has expressive eyebrows, which many of you had heard about. When he speaks, he speaks with his eyebrows. ... One of the things I discovered in watching the footage, he doesn\\'t blink when he speaks.\" Thus, when animating the figure\\'s eye movements, Fitzgerald says, there was much discussion over his \"blink profile,\" ensuring it matched up with filmed footage.\\nThough the exact arc of the show, which will run about 17 minutes, wasn\\'t revealed, Fitzgerald and fellow Imagineer Jeff Shaver-Moskowitz, who was instrumental in the recent reimagining of Disneyland\\'s Toontown, noted that all dialogue will be taken directly from Disney\\'s speeches. The setting will be in Disney\\'s office, and for much of the show Disney will be leaning on his desk, although the figure was teased as being able to stand up.\\nFitzgerald and Shaver-Moskowitz note that they researched Disney\\'s shoe size, looked at molds of his hands and even attempted — and failed — to find out which hair products Disney used. He will be wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo for Palm Springs\\' Smoke Tree Ranch, a favorite retreat of Disney\\'s.\\n\"We didn\\'t order an animatronic to look like Walt,\" Shaver-Moskowitz says. \"We built a Walt animatronic to deliver a performance that was specifically Walt.\"\\nYet can any animatronic capture the essence of a human, even a theatrical interpretation of one?\\n\"You could never get the casualness of his talking,\" Disney\\'s granddaughter Miller wrote in her post. While those who know the Disney family have confirmed the veracity of the post, attempts to reach Miller have been unsuccessful. Members of the Walt Disney family are said to be divided, with many supporting the animatronic and some others against it, say those in the know who have declined to speak on the record for fear of ruining their relationships.\\n\"He was so fascinated with technology, and also the intersection between technology and art,\" says Kirsten Komoroske, executive director of the Walt Disney Family Museum, of Disney. Multiple descendants of Disney\\'s sit on various boards that the Family Museum is associated with, and Komoroske says those working with the institution have pledged their support of the animatronic. \"They really feel that he would have liked this project.\"\\nOthers who knew Disney, such as legendary Imagineer Bob Gurr, the designer of the Disneyland Monorail, the Matterhorn Bobsleds and more, as well as a pivotal collaborator on the Lincoln figure, have confirmed that they have seen the animatronic but have chosen not to discuss it. “I am embargoed,” Gurr told The Times, adding only that the public would have “quite a reaction.”\\nImagineers were asked about Miller\\'s comments. Dusty Sage, executive editor of Disney fan site Micechat, told the audience he has spoken with Miller and her primary concern was that Disney never wanted to be turned into a robotic figure.\\nRead more: 14 places in L.A. that every Disney lover must visit at least once\\n\"In all our research, we never found any documentation of Walt saying that,\" Shaver-Moskowitz says. \"We know that it\\'s anecdotal and we can\\'t speak to what was told to people in private and we can\\'t speak to Joanna\\'s specific feelings about the project. But we have worked very diligently for many years with the Walt Disney Family Museum and members of the Disney and Miller family. ... We\\'ve taken care to make sure that the family is along the journey with us and we feel that we\\'ve presented a faithful and theatrical presentation that keeps Walt alive in the medium that he pioneered.\"\\nThe Walt Disney Co. has made a significant effort over the years to mythologize Disney. Statues of Disney can be found at both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, and trinkets bearing his image, including an ornament of the latter, can occasionally be spotted for sale in the park\\'s gift shops. The reality of who Disney was has arguably become obscured.\\n\"Walt Disney — A Magical Life\" will walk a fine line when it opens, attempting to inspire a new generation to look into Disney\\'s life while also portraying him as more than just a character in the park\\'s arsenal.\\n\"Why are we doing this now?\" Fitzgerald says. \"For two reasons. One is Disneyland\\'s 70th anniversary is an ideal time we thought to create a permanent tribute to Walt Disney in the Opera House. The other: I grew up watching Walt Disney on television. I guess I\\'m the old man. He came into our living room every week and chatted and it was very casual and you felt like you knew the man. But a lot of people today don\\'t know Walt Disney was an individual. They think Walt Disney is a company.\"\\nAnd now nearly 60 years after his death, Disney will once again grace Main Street, whether or not audiences — or even some members of his family — are ready to greet him.\\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.'}\n",

Sam Altman just carved out a brand-new 'CEO' role for her at OpenAI\\nSocial card description: Simo told Fortune the U.S. healthcare system is not well-suited to treat rare and complex diseases, which is a major opportunity for AI.\\n- OpenAI just created a new role at the company for Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. The 39-year-old executive will join Sam Altman’s AI giant in a brand new role, “CEO of Applications,” reporting directly to Altman.\\nOpenAI announced Thursday it’s bringing on Fidji Simo, the CEO of Instacart, to become the company’s first-ever CEO of Applications. While Sam Altman will continue to oversee every aspect of the company as CEO, Simo’s new role “brings together a group of existing business and operational teams responsible for how our research reaches and benefits the world,” according to the company.\\nSimo will transition from her top job at Instacart “over the next few months” and join OpenAI “later this year,” according to an OpenAI blog post.\\n“Fidji is exceptional,” Altman said on X Thursday morning. “We have worked together on OpenAI for the past year and I have observed her deep commitment to our mission. I cannot imagine a better new team member to help us scale the next 10x (or 100x, let’s see).”\\nIn October 2024, Simo spoke with Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell about AI, and its ability to move the needle in industries like health care.\\n“I think with AI, we’re going to have way more ability to connect a lot more data, to mine that data to find better insights, and then to use those insights to tell people how to change their behavior,” she told Fortune.\\nOriginally from a small port city in southern France, Simo was notably the first member of her family—comprised mostly of fishermen—to graduate from high school. Simo told Marie Claire in 2019 she would get “atrociously seasick” every time her father tried to take her out onto the water. When she was 20 years old, she interned as a lobbyist for the fishing industry one summer, where she grew accustomed to being one of the only women in the room.\\n“At meetings, it was just me plus old, retired fishermen,” she said.\\nAfter earning a master of management degree from the esteemed HEC Paris business school, Simo spent four years at eBay before joining Facebook in 2011 to help lead the advertising program for the company’s News Feed. In 2014, she was promoted to director of product development, helping spearhead the company’s mobile-ad products, and in 2019 she became head of the Facebook app. She oversaw the News Feed as well as Marketplace, Ads, Groups, Video, Stories, and more.\\nIn January 2021, Simo joined Instacart’s board of directors, and just seven months later, she was named CEO, replacing Apoorva Mehta. She helped the company lead a successful IPO in September 2023.\\nWhile Simo proved her success as a businesswoman over the years, OpenAI’s desire to bring her on to lead AI applications makes more sense when you consider her passion for applying artificial intelligence to health care.\\nSimo founded the Metrodora Institute in 2023 after suffering from symptoms for years—particularly fainting and feeling weak, as she told Fortune in 2021—but was misdiagnosed by doctors and neurologists who passed off her symptoms as a byproduct of being “a tired mom.” After going to the Mayo Clinic, however, she was diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, a lesser-known disorder that affects the nervous system.\\nSimo told Fortune‘s Alyson Shontell at the Most Powerful Women Conference last October that after years of pursuing a proper diagnosis for what she was experiencing, she “realized the level of research on these conditions was absolutely appalling” and felt the need for a more holistic approach to treating rare and complex diseases.\\n“In 2020, I was kind of falling apart from head to toe,” she said. “That seemed very terrifying that I would be diagnosed with a chronic illness—that’s incurable—and that there was pretty much no research being done to explain the biology behind these conditions. So I set out to create Metrodora, which is essentially the idea of partnering with patients to enroll them in research and gather all the 360 data points on them. We look at their genetics, we look at their immune profiling, we look at their reported symptoms, we look at their environment.”\\nSimo said she believes the current health care system that treats people “as a set of body organs” is not well-suited to treat chronic diseases because “all of these systems interact together.”\\n“You go to a cardiologist for your heart, and the gynecologist thinks you’re just a giant walking uterus,” she said at the MPW conference. “The beauty of AI is in the past, these data sets were very siloed, and even if you wanted to analyze a ton of genomics data, that was a huge endeavor that could take many months, let alone if you wanted to do it across all the data points I mentioned. But now, because we have these tools that allow us to analyze giant data sets, we’re going to be able to understand patterns we couldn’t understand before.”\\nWhile OpenAI hasn’t specified the projects Simo will work on once she joins the company as CEO of Applications, company boss Altman did say she will “focus on enabling our ‘traditional’ company functions to scale as we enter a next phase of growth.”\\n“This organization has the potential of accelerating human potential at a pace never seen before,” Simo said in a statement, which Altman re-shared in a blog post. “I am deeply committed to shaping these applications toward the public good.”\"}\n",

Here's What AI Experts Think. | HuffPost Life\\nSocial card title: Mark Zuckerberg Thinks AI 'Friends' Can Solve The Loneliness Crisis. Here's What AI Experts Think.\\nSocial card description: The tech billionaire also suggested there may be untapped potential in AI girlfriends and therapists.\\nFeeling lonely? Mark Zuckerberg thinks maybe it’s time you send an AI bot a friend request.\\nLast week, the Meta CEO sat down for an hour-long conversation with podcaster Dwarkesh Patel and argued that it’s only a matter of time before society sees the “value” in AI friendships.\\n“There’s this stat that I always think is crazy,” Zuckerberg says in a clip going around social media. “The average American, I think, has, I think it’s fewer than three friends. Three people that they consider friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it’s like 15 friends or something, right?”\\nWhile Zuckerberg doesn’t argue that AI can replace actual friends, he does say it can get people longing for “connectivity” closer to that 15 number. (Especially “when the personalization loop starts to kick in and the AI starts to get to know you better and better,” he said.)\\nThe tech billionaire also suggested there may be untapped potential in AI girlfriends and therapists, both of which are a whole different ethical can of worms.\\nZuckerberg’s remarks quickly went viral, with commenters online accusing him of being out of touch and not comprehending the true nature of friendship. Some called his ideas “dystopian.”\\n“Nothing would solve my loneliness like having 12 friends I made up,” TV writer Mike Drucker joked on Bluesky.\\nYet the tech CEO is, at least, attempting to offer solutions for a known problem. The loneliness epidemic ― especially isolation among teen boys ― is a growing public health concern, with significant individual and societal health implications.\\nAccording to a 2023 Gallup study, nearly 1 in 4 people worldwide ― approximately 1 billion people ― feel very or fairly lonely. (The number would have undoubtedly been higher had the pollsters asked people in China, the second-most populous country in the world.)\\nThat said, as many tech media outlets noted, the argument in favor of AI friends is interesting coming from Zuckerberg, given Meta’s poor track record with implementing AI bots on its own platforms.\\nStefano Puntoni, a marketing professor at the Wharton School who’s been studying the psychological effects of technology for a decade, pointed this out as well.\\n“Given what we know, I am not sure I’d want to delegate the job [of solving the loneliness epidemic] to such companies, considering their track record on mental health and teenage wellbeing,” Puntoni said. “Social media companies are currently not doing much to help most people, especially the young, forge meaningful and healthy connections with themselves or others.”\\nJust last week, Futurism reported that Facebook’s ad algorithm could detect when teen girls deleted selfies so it could serve them beauty ads ― a claim that was made in former Facebook employee Sarah Wynn-Williams’s tell-all, “Careless People.”\\nThere have been cases (and subsequent lawsuits) where kids using AI companions through services like Character.AI, Replika and Nomi, have received messages that turn sexual or encourage self-harm. Meta’s chatbots have similarly engaged in sexual conversations with minors, according to an investigation from The Wall Street Journal, though a Meta spokesperson accused the Post of forcing “fringe” scenarios. (Proponents of AI like to talk about it like it’s a neutral tool ― “AI as the engine, humans as the steering wheel,” they’ll say ― but cases like that complicate the idea.)\\nStill, AI experts like Puntoni aren’t entirely against the idea of AI companionship. When used in moderation and with built-in boundaries in place, they say it has some benefits. In his recent research, Puntoni found that AI companions are effective at alleviating momentary feelings of loneliness.\\nThose who used the companion reported a significant decrease in loneliness, reporting an average reduction of 16 percentage points over the course of the week.\\nPuntoni and his colleagues also compared how lonely a person felt after engaging with an AI companion versus a real person, and surprisingly, the results were pretty much the same: Contact with people brought a 19-percentage-point drop in loneliness levels, and 20 percentage points for an AI companion.\\n“In our studies, we didn’t test the long-term consequences of AI companions ― our longest study is one week long. That should be a priority for future research,” Puntoni explained.\\n“My expectation is that AI companions will turn out to be very good for the wellbeing of some people and potentially very bad for the long-term wellbeing of others,” he said.\\n“One person even claimed that their best friend was their AI companion despite having several human friends and a real-life husband.”\\nAnd a lot will obviously depend on the decisions made by AI companies, Puntoni said. Take Elon Musk’s X, for instance. A couple of months ago, Grok ― X’s AI bot ― released an X-rated AI voice called “unhinged” that will scream and insult users. (Grok also has personalities for crazy conspiracies, NSFW roleplay and an “Unlicensed Therapist” mode.)\\n“Those examples don’t exactly inspire confidence,” Puntoni said.\\nThere’s privacy concerns to consider when it comes to AI buddies, too, said Jen Caltrider, a consumer privacy advocate. Relationship bots are designed to pull as much personal information out of you as they can to tailor themselves into being your friend, therapist, sexting partner or gaming buddy.\\nBut once you put all those hyper-personal thoughts out into the internet ― which AI is part of ― you lose control of them, Caltrider said.\\n“That personal information is now in the hands of the people on the other end of that AI chatbot,” she said. “Can you trust them? Maybe, but also, maybe not. The research I’ve done shows that too many of the AI chatbot apps out there have questionable, at best, privacy policies and track records.”\\nDan Weijers, a senior lecturer in philosophy who studies ethical uses of technology at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, also thinks we should be skeptical about any pronouncements about AI from any profit-taking company spokesperson.\\nBut he concedes that AI “friendship” can provide some things that human friendship could never: 24/7 availability (and the instant gratification that comes with that) and the ability to tailor AI to be the perfect, always agreeable companion.\\nThat agreeableness is a polarizing feature. OpenAI recently withdrew an update that made ChatGPT “annoying” and “sycophantic” after users shared screenshots and anecdotes of the chatbot giving them over-the-top praise.\\nOthers don’t mind the kissing up. Weijers, who visits a lot of forums reading about human-AI companion interactions as part of his research, said there are those cases where a person falls in love with their AI companion, not unlike the scenario in Spike Jonze’s 2013 film “Her.”\\n“A minority of users of AI companions have romantic relationships with their AI but some will even say they are married to them,” Weijers said. “On one online forum, one person even claimed that their best friend was their AI companion despite having several human friends and a real-life husband.”\\nStill, isn’t part of friendship hearing the thoughts and opinions of someone who’s different from us? That’s what Sven Nyholm, a professor of the ethics of artificial intelligence at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, wonders about these bonds.\\n“AI chatbots can simulate conversation and produce plausible-sounding text outputs that resemble the sorts of things friends might say to us,” Nyholm said, but that’s about it.\\n“As humans, we want to be seen and recognized by others. We care about what other people think about us,” he said. “Other people have minds, whereas AI chatbots are mindless zombies.”\\n“It’s scary to think there might be more money going into training AIs to understand humans than for humans to understand AIs.”\\nValerie Tiberius, professor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota and the author of the forthcoming book “Artificially Yours: AI And The Value Of Friendship,” thinks AI companions supplementing friendships could still be healthy. Supplanting your friends is another story.\\n“Challenging, messy human friendships that contain friction and disagreement help us develop into interesting people; they enrich our lives beyond just improving our mood,” she said.\\nIf you only had chatbot friends that are programmed to be unerringly supportive and positive, “you wouldn’t learn how dumb some of your own ideas are,” Tiberius said. “I also appreciate that my friends sometimes ‘check’ me in ways that a chatbot wouldn’t do.”\\nWhat AI chatbots “say” to us is based on impressive machine learning programs, but if you care about getting true recognition, Nyholm thinks they’re a poor substitute.\\n“I also really think we should perhaps start talking about the ‘AI-ization’ of life: When it is suggested that any problem — including loneliness ― should be solved with the help of AI, then we might be trapped in a mindset where it is assumed that for any problem we might have, AI is the solution.”\\nIf people are lonely and need friends, instead of telling them AI can be their friend, Nyholm thinks tech companies should be using technology to connect them with other lonely people who are also looking for friends.\\nOne thing is clear to Caltrider, the privacy advocate: As more and more people use these AI companions, we’re going to need some serious AI literacy training to learn how to navigate this new, so-far unwieldy territory.\\n“I just read an article about a developing field of AI psychiatry to help AIs overcome their mistakes,” she said. “It’s scary to think there might be more money going into training AIs to understand humans than for humans to understand AIs.”\\nFor the time being, Caltrider isn’t trusting AI to be her friend.\\n“Everyone has to make their own decisions here, though,” she said. “And honestly, I’ve asked ChatGPT some questions I probably wouldn’t want the world to know. It’s just easy and, yes, kind of fun.”\"}\n",

Animals might understand us, but we can’t really know what each excited bark or indifferent meow means.\\nRecent research has shown that dogs can “talk” with the help of buttons placed on the ground, each playing a different word. At least one such dog has gone viral on social media in recent years for its ability to answer human questions and form simple sentences using those buttons.\\nBut that’s not the same as understanding what pets are trying to say. Instead, we might be developing tech that lets some animals “talk.” Even then, they can only form very simple sentences using whatever buttons they can press with a paw.\\nWhat might actually help us understand what animals are saying in real time is AI, and one Chinese tech giant thinks it has the technology to one day offer tools that interpret barks and meows as they happen around you.\\nBaidu, which has been making notable progress with ChatGPT-like models in recent years, submitted a patent to the China National Intellectual Property Administration in December proposing AI technology for translating animal messages.\\nI usually say that tech in patent applications doesn’t always make it to commercial products, and the same goes for Baidu’s proposed AI solution to translate animal sounds into words we can understand.\\nMaybe the Chinese giant is onto something, or maybe not. What’s interesting here is the patent itself. Filing such a document means Baidu thinks it may have discovered something meaningful.\\nAccording to South China Morning Post, the Chinese patent authority just published the application publicly on Tuesday.\\nThe document explains how Baidu’s AI might go about translating what pets are saying into human words. First, the AI collects a lot of information, which is how any AI model starts. You need to train it with data before it can produce useful results.\\nThe AI would observe the target animal and gather information from its behavior, including “voice, body language, behavioural changes, and other biological signs.” Of course, pets won’t have the same privacy rights we expect when it comes to internet services and AI collecting data about us.\\nOnce it has the data, Baidu’s AI would try to determine the animal’s emotion, then attempt to convert it into human language. If the voice doesn’t match any emotional record, the team would manually label the data.\\nBaidu’s AI tech would rely on several areas of AI, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. These technologies would allow the system to process large data sets and learn from them. The AI would analyze the voice and movements of the animals, then turn that behavior into human speech by generating an AI voice for the animal.\\nIf the technology works, it might still be a while before it’s available. But if it does work, I can see how easy it could be to implement. Companies like Baidu might develop AI apps specifically designed to help pets talk.\\n“There has been a lot of interest in the filing of our patent application,” a Baidu spokesperson told Reuters. “Currently, it is still in the research phase.”\\nImagine using a mobile app that gives the AI access to your camera. You’d point it at your dog or cat, and the model, which was already pretrained on lots of pet data, would recognize their barks and meows, and maybe even their moods. The app might then turn those sounds into spoken words.\\nAnother possibility is that the AI could record your pet’s sounds and behavior for a final round of training before translating them. Of course, this is just speculation.\\nThe good news is it’ll be easy to tell if the tech works. Once researchers start figuring out what pets are trying to say and meeting their needs, pets will give immediate feedback. I’m pretty sure even cats will be impressed, no matter how nonchalant they act. Any successful back-and-forth involving barks, meows, and human words would prove the AI works. I do expect limitations, of course — fish and mice might be out of luck.\\nIt’ll also be interesting to see if Baidu gets a patent for the animal translation AI it’s trying to protect. I’m sure other AI labs around the world have had similar ideas. It’s just a matter of time before one of them creates AI tech that lets us understand what animals are saying.\\nWhile we wait, check out Sapphie the Pomsky on Instagram.

There’s huge amounts of prediction about what the future holds.1 But I haven’t come across many case studies of rolling out the tools that exist today. So here’s some observations.\\nFor context: SaaS product. Ruby on Rails. Mature (12 years) codebase, in good condition. About 40 developers.\\nCursor & Claude Code\\nWe’ve given every developer the option to buy Cursor or Claude Code. (I’ll refer to these as Agents for the rest of this article.) If someone wanted to buy another agentic tool that isn’t one of those we’d probably say yes if the price was similar. In a recent informal survey I did, 8 people answered yes to “I use Cursor/Claude Code for most (or all) of my coding”, and 11 to “I alternate between using them and not using them based on the task, it averages out to about 50% of the time”.\\nI use Claude Code and don’t really like Cursor. The main reason for that is I’m obsessed with Sublime Text as my editor. So having to change to another editor is basically a deal breaker for me. Most other people are more sane, and thus Cursor adoption has been slightly higher than Claude.\\nThey also different things. Claude (particularly with the newest models) likes to write entire features for you, and can sometimes get a bit carried away. Anthropic’s best practices guide is a goldmine, and one great suggestion it made that I’ve successfully adopted is asking Claude to make a plan before writing any code, and then telling it to write the code.\\nBy contrast, Cursor (from what I’ve seen) seems to be content making smaller and more self contained changes. It seems less likely to try and write the entire thing and commit it without your consent. Conversely, it seems less capable of doing ambitious one shot prompts.\\nIn the future, a “senior engineer” might be someone who knows the right agent to use for the given task.\\nWhat are the productivity gains?\\nIt’s the question everyone is asking. And to be honest it’s hard to give a totally objective answer. How did you mention developer productivity before agents?\\nThat said if forced to pick a number I would say I’m about 20% more productive thanks to agents. But there’s a massive grain of salt there. Agents are really helpful for some things, and barely helpful at all for others, so right now it is all about incorporating them into your workflow where it makes sense.\\nSome people online who are against agentic coding argue that with a junior developer you can teach them stuff and so they gradually improve over time. But the same can’t be said for agents, they are always going to be as smart as they are today, so if they are as good as a junior dev now they’ll always be only that good. Presumably this applies to domain specific stuff, since LLMs already know all the generic stuff in the world. Regardless, it’s nonsense, and is easily disproven by two observations:\\nUsing agents well changes how you structure your codebase in a way that makes them more able to work with it over time, ie. they get smarter.\\nThe quality of LLMs is improving often. The other week ChatGPT added a feature where it remembers everything you’ve ever said to it and incorporates that into context, which sounds a lot to me like a junior picking up domain knowledge and building on it.\\nRemembering to use the agent\\nSo far the biggest limiting factor is remembering to use it. Even people I consider power users (based on their Claude token usage) agree with the sentiment that sometimes you just forget to ask Claude to do a task for you, and end up doing it manually. Sometimes you only notice that Claude could have done it, once you are finished. This happens to me an embarrassing amount.\\nI suspect this is less of an issue for Cursor users because it’s always there in your editor, while Claude Code lives in your terminal.\\nIncreasing ambition\\nWe have found agents work really well for increasing the ambition of code that gets written. This can mean a few different things:\\nOur head of product is a reformed lawyer who taught himself to code while working here. He’s shipped 150 PRs in the last 12 months.\\nThe product manager he sits next to has shipped 130 PRs in the last 12 months. When we look for easy wins and small tasks for new starters, it’s harder now, because he’s always got an agent chewing through those in the background.\\nWe built a new product for a new region with a single developer working solo (with the help of Claude). Previously we did this slower, with teams of people. Those teams are adopting Claude now too, but using it from the start and getting good at using it really helps.\\nI’m sure everyone comes across feature ideas that sound cool but it’s not obvious right now where to start. Like a coding writers block. Turns out typing a prompt is a lot easier than typing the code and it is a great way to unblock and get started on ideas you wouldn’t otherwise try.\\nAgents are extremely good at helping you understand parts of the codebase you haven’t seen before - just ask them - and I suspect that’s helping a lot here.\\nBug fixes\\nA few times now we’ve tried to connect agents to Linear or Sentry to try and get automatic draft PRs for bug fixing. So far the results have been mixed.\\nAll you are really doing here is hoping that the Linear ticket (or context in Sentry issue) is enough that the agent can work out the bug and fix it. In other words you’re hoping the ticket works as well as a one shot prompt that a developer would write. Sometimes this happens, and if it does it’s very impressive.\\nMore often it doesn’t. The issue I’ve found is that in many cases the proposed fix is incorrect, but in a subtle way, where if you don’t know the codebase you’re looking at (or don’t think about it critically enough) you’ll be led astray. It’s easy to see a draft PR with all tests passing, including new tests full of comments, and not realise that the tests are garbage and the fix is wrong. This is less likely to happen if you have taken time to think about the feature & scope beforehand, but much more likely if you see a bug report and a green draft PR ready to go alongside it.\\nFor this reason we have avoided pushing automatic draft PRs.\\nRefactors\\nClaude Code is incredibly good at refactors. Particularly if the refactors involve frontend code.\\nA recent example was to convert a set of screens built into React into our new design system, that’s built on Hotwire and is all rendered serverside. Using this prompt Claude Code came up with an almost right plan. I made a few tweaks and then asked it to write the code, which it did correctly.\\nIt missed a few client side validations that we only found while testing, which is to say that it’s important to still test. I think if I had explicitly asked it to ensure it included all these sorts of validations in my prompt it would have.\\nDoing the refactor by hand would have taken me a few hours, so realistically using the agent probably saved me an hour. But it would have been boooooring. Knowing how boring it would be, I’d been putting off doing it forever, even though it was something I really wanted to see done. Agents are underrated for quickly getting through chores.\\nNon-core framework features\\nAgents work great at doing straightforward tasks using straightforward parts of well documented frameworks.\\nYou have to be careful with more complex tasks that are below the surface level, where you could get a wide variety of architectures come back and you need to be critical about getting the best one.\\nFor example, I asked an agent to help me ensure that a specific operation could only happen once at any time. I suggested it used locking. It came back with a custom built Redis locking mechanism. After a nudge, it suggested using the Rails cache. After another nudge, a manually executed Postgres advisory lock. After another nudge, it finally settled on Rails’ with_lock\\nmethod. Had I not been thinking critically it would have had me introduce new dependencies to solve a problem where tools to fix it were built into the framework.\\nAgent cost\\nCursor has a fixed price. I suspect they are thinking about pricing the way gyms do: if everyone used Cursor as much as they allow you to, they’d go out of business. But in practice most people use a lot less tokens than they are paying for.\\nYou can see this in practice when you use Claude Code, which is pay-per-token. Our heaviest users are using $50/month of tokens. That’s a lot of tokens.\\nI asked our CFO and he said he’d be happy to spend $100/dev/month on agents. To get 20% more productive that’s a bargain.\\nCoding style & beauty\\nThis critique may only make sense to sufficiently DHH-pilled people, but so be it. I haven’t yet come across an agent that can write beautiful code.\\nThat doesn’t mean it can’t write correct code, or (particularly if you prompt it right) succinct code. And it isn’t to say that all code needs to be beautiful. But in some cases the elegance of the code does matter because it says a lot about the elegance - and the quality - of the architecture. Agents still aren’t there in those cases.\\nThe most common thing that makes agentic code ugly is the overuse of comments. I have tried everything I can think of and apart from prefacing every prompt with “Don’t write comments” I cannot find a way to get agents to not comment every line they write.2\\nIn the worst case this means rewriting all the code the agent wrote. I still think this is worthwhile. Often writing the prompt and going back and forth will the agent will help you understand the issue better which will lead to you writing your architecture better. And they write code so quickly, it’s not like you’re wasting days before throwing it away and writing it yourself.\\nA related issue is that if everyone uses agents, individual coding styles are lost. When you’ve worked with someone for a while you can tell if they wrote some code just by reading it. That is lost when everything goes through an agent. I’m sure in 10 years time this will seem quaint, like mourning over the assembly that powers the C code that sits under Ruby. But for now it makes me a little bit sad sometimes.\\nMaking the codebase “AI friendly”\\nWe’ve done a few things to make the codebase easier for agents to reason with.\\nSetting up Cursor rules and Claude.md. These end up also holding great context for new teammates.\\nMaking it easy to run tests with a single command. We used to do development & run tests via docker over ssh. It was a good idea at the time. But fixing a few things so that we could run tests locally meant we could ask the agent to run (and fix!) tests after writing code.\\nMandating AI use\\nMany companies have issued mandates for using AI, some of which have leaked publicly.3\\nWe haven’t. That doesn’t mean I don’t expect people to try this stuff out, but I think forcing them to do it is silly. If the productivity gains are as significant as I suspect they are, than anyone who has their self interest (or the company’s interests, if they are so inclined) at heart will quickly pick up agentic coding.\\nConclusions and the future\\nIt is a very exciting time to be in software development. I’ve written this a few times, but it’s really true, and every time I write it I then get more impressed with the quality of agentic coding.\\nSimilar to being good at writing code, being good at using agents is not a binary thing. There’s a sliding scale of quality. In the future there will be 10x prompters just like today there’s 10x developers.\\nI think it’s worth trying to get really good at using agents to code, no matter where in your career you are. Even with agents, the hardest thing in programming remains working out what the software should do, and articulating it well. Bashing out the syntax continues to get easier.\\nThere’s also plenty of articles about why AI can’t transform coding, which are good for a laugh.\\nA close second in Rails is adding `rescue` statements to every controller action.\\nThe irony of Ben Thompson posting Milei videos on X and then monitoring everyone’s Gemini usage is not lost on me.\\n@Alex, this is by a wide margin the most practical and best-written AI use in coding article I've read. Hat tip from me.\"}\n",

That’s where Nutanix Inc. positions itself — as the bridge between ambition and execution, according to Debo Dutta (pictured, right), chief AI officer at Nutanix.\\n“We have a threefold strategy to deal with the rapid pace of innovation,” Dutta said. “The way we look at it is AI on Nutanix, so we want to have the best agentic platform we’re running on Nutanix, our whole infrastructure, so that we can speed up things. Then AI at Nutanix, so we’re using the same platform to optimize Nutanix. Then AI in Nutanix is [where] we’re trying to improve our products with AI.”\\nDutta and Jason Langone (left), global AI business development leader at Nutanix, spoke with theCUBE’s John Furrier and Bob Laliberte at Nutanix .NEXT, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed platform readiness, AI operationalization and the path from lab experiment to real-world scale. (* Disclosure below.)\\nTurning prototypes into enterprise infrastructure impact\\nNutanix’s approach helps IT teams bypass complexity while maintaining control, offering what Dutta described as “simple ways to do day-to-day operations” and centralized governance. This strategy appeals to enterprises looking to move quickly without sacrificing oversight, according to Dutta.\\n“Enterprise IT can give very detailed access controls of who owns what model and who has access,” he said. “Then we have audit logs, we have telemetry. So, with a combination of these technology features, we give the enterprise IT complete control of the infrastructure running large language models and endpoints.”\\nOperationalizing AI requires more than just technical chops. Nutanix focuses on making complex deployments repeatable and accessible with tools that help IT teams support models over the long haul, according to Langone.\\n“To me, that’s one of the anchors of the value Nutanix brings with enterprise AI, is [that] we could pull it up right now,” he said. “Three clicks, you’ve authorized the model of Hugging Face, Nvidia [and] imported your own.

He reiterated that all functions will remain integrated under a single OpenAI structure, including its nonprofit arm.\\nSimo will remain Instacart’s CEO for the coming months and help onboard her successor, who is expected to come from the company’s existing management team. She will continue serving as Chair of the Instacart Board after stepping down as CEO.\\nOpenAI’s evolving structure and AI stack\\nAltman emphasized the strategic importance of the new role, noting that OpenAI has evolved beyond its original identity as a research lab.\\nOver the past two and a half years, the company has grown into a global product provider and, more recently, an infrastructure builder delivering AI tools at large scale.\\n“We’re in a privileged position to be scaling at a pace that lets us do them all simultaneously, and bringing on exceptional leaders is a key part of doing that well,” Altman wrote in his blog post.\\nHe described Simo as uniquely qualified to lead the Applications group, citing her leadership experience, operational expertise, and alignment with OpenAI’s mission.\\nSeparately, in prepared testimony before the U.S. Congress today, Altman also included a chart showing how OpenAI views the “AI stack” it offers customers, and how the entire industry is divided into three core buckets or “layers”:\\nAlso in that testimony, Altman revealed more examples of what OpenAI considers to be part of the AI applications layer, among them, chatbots such as its hit ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot (also powered in part by AI models):\\n“Ultimately, both the infrastructure and platform layers support the applications layer. These are devices and software applications that use AI to deliver better services to people. ChatGPT and 4 Microsoft’s Copilot are both examples of AI applications. One of the amazing things about the applications layer is it’s not just companies – large or small or established or startup – that are creating AI applications. It’s everybody. It’s researchers using new AI-infused applications to change drug discovery. It’s non-profits changing the way they deliver services. It’s teachers using AI as a tool to improve the way they prepare material for a classroom. It’s governments making everything from the filing of a tax return to the renewal of a driver’s license easier and more efficient.\\nTo build a new AI economy, it’s critical to get all three of these layers working and to get a flywheel turning across the ecosystem. It’s essential to build the infrastructure layer so people can develop and deploy the models at the platform layer. It’s essential to use the AI models so that people will build the applications on top of them. And it’s essential for customers to adopt the applications, so the market can grow, and drive increased investment to expand the infrastructure further. The process repeats itself. This is how a new economy is born.”\\nMore OpenAI team members shared praise for Simo on social media, mainly X, where Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Kate Rouch wrote of the new hire: “She’s all signal. No noise. Highest integrity leader I know. Very good news: for OpenAI, for all of us.”\\nCaitlin Kalinowski, who is a member of the technical staff at OpenAI and leads its hardware and robotics vision, also took to X to post, in part: “We couldn’t be luckier to have her deep experience and warm leadership style. Welcome, Fidji!!!”\\nSimo boasts an impressive track record focused on turning tech into viable businesses\\nSimo joined OpenAI’s board in March 2024 and brings extensive leadership experience in technology, consumer platforms, and healthcare innovation.\\nAt Instacart, she oversaw the company’s public debut and a series of business milestones, including scaling its advertising business and launching new offerings.\\nBefore that, she spent a decade at Facebook, where she led the core Facebook app and was responsible for key product areas including Video, Marketplace, Groups, and Ads.\\nShe is also the co-founder of the Metrodora Institute, a clinic and research center focused on neuroimmune disorders, where she serves as President of the Metrodora Foundation. In addition to her board seat at OpenAI, Simo sits on the boards of Shopify and previously Cirque du Soleil.\\nWith this leadership appointment, OpenAI is signaling a deeper focus on scaling its consumer and enterprise-facing AI offerings. By establishing a dedicated CEO role for its Applications division, the company aims to build stronger operational infrastructure while aligning with its broader mission to develop AI that benefits the public.\\nImplications for enterprise technical decision makers\\nFor enterprise stakeholders building on OpenAI’s models, this leadership move could signal important changes in how OpenAI develops, packages, and delivers its software interfaces and tools. The creation of a dedicated Applications division reflects a deeper commitment to the operational scale and reliability that large organizations increasingly demand from AI vendors. As the company matures from a research-centric entity into a provider of business-critical infrastructure and applications, users may see improvements in product stability, integration support, and roadmap clarity—areas where traditional software vendors have long invested, but newer AI entrants are still catching up.\\nSimo’s appointment may also hint at a broader productization push within OpenAI. Her background at Facebook and Instacart underscores a focus on monetizing complex platforms and converting experimental technologies into widely adopted consumer and enterprise solutions. Enterprise leaders watching for cues on OpenAI’s future direction might reasonably expect an expansion in verticalized offerings, developer tooling, and support for enterprise-grade deployments.\\nMore broadly, the move acknowledges a shift happening across the AI industry: successful adoption increasingly depends not just on model quality or research novelty, but on how well these systems integrate into the operational realities of businesses. As OpenAI grows its executive bench to reflect that need, it’s aligning more closely with the enterprise audience it now serves—an audience that values not only performance and innovation but reliability, control, and product maturity.'}\n",

For its Q4 forecast, Peloton said it expected about $5 million in headwinds for its free cash flow as a result.\\nWhile Peloton downplayed the impact of tariffs, it’s a fact that Peloton hardware isn’t the cheapest on the market. To that end, Coddington was keen to emphasize that Peloton offers zero percent interest financing, a bike rental program, as well as lower-priced refurbished models. Stern also said the company worked with partners to “pilot dedicated vans stocked with Peloton spare parts” for repairs in a bid to increase customer satisfaction. Stern also shared that the company had appointed a new Chief Operating Officer Charles Kirol, whose main goal is to focus on supply chain logistics and cost management.\\nCEO Peter Stern added that the company is taking a hard look at pricing, “taking into consideration the impact of tariffs.” Regarding subscriptions, Stern declined to comment but noted it’s been nearly three years since the company hiked subscription prices.\\nOverall, however, Peloton saw losses with hardware sales falling 27 percent year-over-year and subscription revenue dropping four percent over the same time period. Despite that, the company raised its outlook from $247.6 to $247.7 million.\\nA bit more out of left field, Stern took time out of the call to emphasize how AI will help Peloton improve customer satisfaction and efficiency. “I think AI has the potential to give humans superpowers, and so that’s how we’re using AI,” says Stern. As for how, exactly, the company is using AI, Stern primarily discussed how customer support staff now have an AI agent to help them take notes on calls. Peloton has also added AI-powered translations for subtitling its classes. It says it subtitled 3,300 classes this way in Q3, and has ramped up to translating roughly 100 classes per day using AI.\\nStern also noted that Peloton has been “deploying Google Gemini to most of its Peloton team members” as it will allow them to use their “big creative brains to do big creative thinking.” He added that Peloton is also using AI in personalized plans where the company “take[s] our amazing human instructors and allow[s] them to basically create a program so that we feel more like a personal coach.” Launched in Q3, Stern says that the company is already up to half a million personalized plans set up.\\n“The future is bright for Peloton members with AI,” he said.\\nMost Popular\\n- You can now submit your claims for Apple’s $95 million Siri spying settlement\\n- Android’s splashy new paint job won’t yank Gen Z from iPhones\\n- Sony WH-1000XM6 headphone specs and details leak early\\n- Whoop wants everyone to give a whoop about the new Whoop 5.0\\n- Bill Gates tears into Elon Musk for being ‘involved in the deaths of the world’s poorest children’'}\n",

The artificial intelligence startup has an\\nOpenAI is reportedly envisioning a future where it shares less revenue with longtime benefactor Microsoft.\\nThe artificial intelligence startup has an agreement with Microsoft to share 20% of its top-line revenue. However, OpenAI told investors it expects to share just 10% of its revenue with its partners, Microsoft among them, by 2030, The Information reported Tuesday (May 6), citing financial documents.\\nThe company continues “to work closely with Microsoft and [looks] forward to finalizing the details of this recapitalization in the near future,” an OpenAI spokesperson said, per the report.\\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, with an agreement to continue sharing revenue until 2030, the report said.\\nMeanwhile, Microsoft’s strategy of installing AI as a default feature on its software seemed to be bearing fruit. The company recorded a 10% uptick in revenue from consumer subscriptions to Office 365 in the three months ending in March versus a year prior.\\nNews about OpenAI’s revenue plans came one day after the company announced it would revise its corporate plan to keep its nonprofit parent firmly in control of the for-profit entity behind ChatGPT. That decision reverses the company’s earlier plan that would have given up voting power in exchange for easier fundraising.\\n“When we started OpenAI, we did not have a detailed sense for how we were going to accomplish our mission,” CEO Sam Altman wrote in a Monday (May 5) company blog post. “We started out staring at each other around a kitchen table, wondering what research we should do. Back then, we did not contemplate products, a business model. We could not contemplate the direct benefits of AI being used for medical advice, learning, productivity and much more, or the needs for hundreds of billions of dollars of compute to train models and serve users.”\\nOpenAI is in the middle of planning a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank, which could value the company at roughly $300 billion. The round had been contingent on the company switching to for-profit control.\\nKeeping the nonprofit arm could complicate the fundraising effort, but it could also help to defuse a lawsuit from OpenAI co-founder Elon Musk, who accuses the company of straying from its public-interest roots.\\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter.\\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has abruptly abandoned its effort to supervise Google Payment, unraveling a marquee Biden-era bid to extend the agency’s reach into Silicon Valley and lifting a potential compliance burden from parent company Alphabet. The policy U-turn surfaced in a Wednesday (May 7) internal memorandum obtained by Bloomberg News.\\nActing CFPB Director Russell Vought said in the memo that continuing to monitor Google’s payments arm would be “an unwarranted use of the Bureau’s powers and resources.”\\nHis decision rescinds a December 2024 order issued by then-Director Rohit Chopra that had subjected the unit to the same type of routine examinations banks face. The CFPB said in its initial press release that it is responsible for supervising a wide range of financial firms, including nonbank entities, to ensure they are complying with federal consumer financial protection laws; that it must issue a notice to an entity not currently subject to a supervisory examination; and that the entity can either consent to supervision or contest the notice.\\nAs PYMNTS reported at that time, “To justify its oversight, the CFPB would need to establish that Google’s financial operations present a substantial risk to consumers. This could align with recent efforts within the agency to implement broader regulatory standards across tech giants that offer financial services. Hundreds of consumer complaints regarding issues like unauthorized charges in Google’s payment services have been documented by the CFPB in recent years, signaling potential consumer risk.”\\nGoogle quietly shuttered the wallet feature at the center of the dispute last June. Even so, the company sued the CFPB in February, arguing the watchdog lacked authority to treat it like a bank. Following Wednesday’s reversal, Google will withdraw that lawsuit, spokesman Jose Castaneda said.\\nAt the time of the lawsuit Castaneda told PYMNTS, “This is a clear case of government overreach involving Google Pay peer-to-peer payments, which never raised risks and is no longer provided in the U.S., and we are challenging it in court.”\\nThe spokesperson changed his tune after the CFPB memo was publicized. “It didn’t make sense for the CFPB to supervise a product that never posed any risks and is no longer available in the U.S.,” Castaneda said in a statement emailed to Bloomberg. “We appreciate their common-sense decision to drop this issue.”\\nThe retreat underscores how swiftly the bureau’s priorities have shifted since Chopra’s departure. Under the prior leadership, the agency aggressively targeted nonbank payment platforms and digital wallets, launching supervisory sweeps and enforcement actions. Vought has signaled a preference for focusing resources on traditional banks, and several pending FinTech cases have already been shelved.\\nIndustry lawyers told Bloomberg said the Google decision could embolden other technology firms to challenge oversight efforts begun during the previous administration, although the CFPB retains enforcement authority over unfair or deceptive practices. The bureau declined to comment on the memo or the lawsuit’s dismissal. Alphabet shares were little changed in afternoon trading.'}\n",

His attorney called the presentation \"inflammatory,\" providing grounds for appeal.  \\nThe road-rage killer of an Arizona man was sentenced last week to 10½ years behind bars after his victim spoke to the court via artificial intelligence in what could be the first-of-its-kind use of the technology, officials said Wednesday.\\nMaricopa County Superior Court Judge Todd Lang on Thursday gave the maximum sentence to Gabriel Paul Horcasitas for the fatal shooting of Christopher Pelkey, 37, on Nov. 13, 2021, prosecutors said.\\nHorcasitas, 54, was convicted of manslaughter and endangerment this year.\\nLang allowed Pelkey\\'s loved ones to play an AI-generated version of the victim — his face and body and a lifelike voice that appeared to ask the judge for leniency.\\n“To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me: It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" the artificial version of Pelkey said. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends. I believe in forgiveness.\"\\nThe idea of using an AI version of Pelkey came from his family, not the state, according to his loved ones and a Maricopa County Attorney\\'s Office spokesperson.\\nStacey Wales, Pelkey’s sister, and his brother-in-law both work in the AI field. When Wales suggested bringing her late brother to life like that, she said, her husband was more than hesitant.\\n\"He recoiled,\" Wales told NBC News. \"And he said: \\'Stacey, do you know what you\\'re asking me to do? This is my best friend.\\' And I said: \\'I know. It\\'s my brother.\\' And then he said, \\'If this isn\\'t perfect, if this doesn\\'t go out and really embody the spirit of Chris, I\\'m not going to let this be shown.\\'\"\\nHorcasitas had been convicted of manslaughter and endangerment at trial in spring 2023. But a new trial was ordered when a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to property disclose potentially key evidence in a timely manner.\\nWales said she hadn\\'t come up with the idea in 2023. After two years of trying to craft a victim impact statement, she said, she had the epiphany that the only voice that mattered was her late brother\\'s.\\n\"Every time I\\'d get in the shower or the car and my thoughts were quiet, I wrote down what I was feeling — frustrated, crying or emotions, yelling, anger, love, anything that I could think of,\" she said.\\n\"I\\'ve been writing it for two years, but I never had the idea to help Chris speak until a week and a half before this second trial.\"\\nShe added: \"What I had to say did not seem like it would do justice to the last person listening to make a decision on Chris\\' life.\"\\nHorcasitas faced seven to 10½ years in prison. The defense asked for the lowest punishment.\\nLang delivered the maximum, but he acknowledged the words in the presentation. \"And as angry as you are, justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" he said. \"I feel like that was genuine, that his obvious forgiveness of Mr. Horcasitas reflects the character I heard about [Pelkey] today.\"\\nDefense lawyer Jason Lamm said the AI presentation created a strong issue for appeal.\\n\"While judges certainly have latitude as to what to hear, particularly from victims, an appellate court will have to decide if this was error,\" Lamm said, \"if it was just simply too far over the line in terms of being inflammatory and to what degree the judge relied on it in imposing a sentence on my client.\"\\nArizona State University law professor Gary Marchant, who specializes in ethics and emerging technologies, praised Pelkey\\'s loved ones for producing a work that appeared to be against their self-interest of securing a maximum penalty for Horcasitas.\\nBut he said he\\'s worried about the precedent it set.\\n\"The family did a really good job of representing what he would have said, and they would have the best sense of what he would have said,\" Marchant said. \"But on the other hand, it\\'s completely fake, right? It\\'s not true.\"\\nWhile prosecutors and defense lawyers have long used visual aids, charts and other illustrations to make their points, Marchant said, AI presents new ethical challenges.\\n\"I mean, it\\'s a blurry line, right?\" said Marchant, who is on a state Supreme Court committee advising on the use of AI. \"You see someone speaking who isn\\'t really speaking, right? You see that person in the courtroom actually speaking, and in reality, they\\'re dead and they\\'re not speaking. So this is an extra jump that I feel is going to get us into dangerous grounds.\"'}\n",

The resignation was posted in a regulatory filing along with the company’s first-quarter earnings report. His resignation will go into effect June 1. He will leave the board August 31.\\nThe company said in the filing that his resignation from the board “did not result from any disagreement with the Company concerning any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices. The Company and the entire Board are deeply grateful for Mr. Anderson’s service and his immense contributions to the Company over the years in his role as founder, Chief Product Officer and a member of the Board.”\\nAnderson is headed to an external opportunity in a senior leadership role at an iconic global company, according to information shared during the company’s earnings call.\\nAnderson could not be reached for comment. He did make comments, however, during the company’s first-quarter earnings call.\\n“Leaving Aurora is one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made, especially given the exciting stage Aurora is at,” he said during Thursday’s call. “This is precisely what gave me the confidence that now is the right time. Aurora has reached a critical inflection point; product Strategy is firmly established. The technology is on the road, the team is in place to scale it, and the momentum we’ve created in the industry is palpable.”\\nAnderson was director of Tesla’s Autopilot program when he left to co-found Aurora in 2017 alongside CEO Chris Urmson, the former head of the Google self-driving project, and Drew Bagnell, who was leading Uber’s autonomy and perception team. The trio, considered pioneers of the autonomous vehicle industry, gave Aurora immediate buzz, helping it attract high-profile investors like Sequoia Capital, Amazon, and T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as a slew of partnerships.\\nAurora gained more cachet in December 2020 when it reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm’s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion. Under the terms of that acquisition, Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber received a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Since then, the startup has experienced explosive growth, reached a valuation exceeding a billion dollars, and expanded its employee count from low double digits to over 150.\\nDespite the team’s average short tenure at the company, Amin made a rare decision: Clay is allowing employees who have at least a year of tenure to sell some of their shares at a relatively high share price to one of its existing investors, Sequoia. It’s a win for everyone. The employee tender offer values the company at $1.5 billion, up from the $1.25 billion it secured in its Series B funding in January. Sequoia, an investor in Clay since its 2019 Series A, has agreed to purchase up to $20 million in employee stock.\\nStartup employees often trade lower pay for a bet on the company’s future, Amin told TechCrunch. “Most of the startups don’t work out, but Clay is working out, and so we wanted to make sure that they have the option of liquidity.”\\nAccording to Amin, both current employees and former employees are eligible to sell a specific portion of their equity, typically equivalent to about one year’s salary.\\nAlfred Lin, a partner at Sequoia and Clay board member, sees Amin’s and co-founder Varun Anand’s decision to offer company-wide participation in the startup’s financial success as another sign of Clay’s uniqueness.\\n“Clay is a very creative place,” Lin said. The startup’s technology helps salespeople and marketers find the right data and automate their go-to-market strategy with AI. Clay’s tools are used by thousands of customers, who range from large companies like OpenAI, HubSpot, and Canva, to over 100 small consulting agencies that help other businesses use Clay for their go-to-market efforts.\\nThe company hasn’t taken its loyal community of customers for granted. In February, Clay gave the option to its direct users to participate in its growth by allowing its community members around the world to invest in the startup at the same valuation offered to its Series B investors. Clay raised about $1 million in a community round so its customers could directly share in its growth, Amin said.\\nExhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI\\nSecure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you’ve built — without the big spend.

Amin said Clay is growing so quickly that he would like to launch tender offers annually.\\nAmin hopes the company’s tender will set a trend, inspiring other startups to offer employee liquidity as well.\"}\n",

You could almost see a faint smile emerge from the deep sigh—part exhaustion and part satisfaction. He was as ready as he could be. His new shop was as ready as it could be. There was nothing left to set up. He locked up and headed home. The grand opening was only seven hours away, and he\\'d better get some sleep.\\nGrand Opening sounds grand—too grand. Alex had regretted putting it on the sign outside the shop\\'s window the previous week. This wasn\\'t a vanity project. He didn\\'t send out invitations to friends, journalists, or local politicians. He didn\\'t hire musicians or waiters to serve customers. Grand Opening simply meant opening for the first time.\\nAlex didn\\'t really know what to expect on the first day. Or maybe he did—he wasn\\'t expecting too many customers. Another coffee shop on the high street? He may need some time to build a loyal client base.\\n• • •\\nHe had arrived early on Monday. He\\'d been checking the lights, the machines, the labels, the chairs, the fridge. And then checking them all again. He glanced at the clock—ten minutes until opening time. But he saw two people standing outside. Surely they were just having a chat, only standing there by chance. He looked again. They weren\\'t chatting. They were waiting.\\nWaiting for his coffee shop to open? Surely not?\\nBut rather than check for the sixth time that the labels on the juice bottles were facing outwards, he decided to open the door a bit early. And those people outside walked in. They were AI Coffee\\'s first customers.\\nToday\\'s article is an overview of the parameters and arguments in Python\\'s functions. It takes you through some of the key principles and discusses the various types of parameters you can define and arguments you can pass to a Python function. There are five numbered sections interspersed within the story in today\\'s article:\\nParameters and Arguments\\nPositional and Keyword Arguments\\nArgs and Kwargs\\nOptional Arguments with Default Values\\nPositional-Only and Keyword-Only Arguments\\nEspressix ProtoSip v0.1 (AlphaBrew v0.1.3.7)\\nIntroducing the Espressix ProtoSip, a revolutionary coffee-making machine designed to elevate the art of brewing for modern coffee shops. With its sleek, futuristic design and cutting-edge technology, this prototype blends precision engineering with intuitive controls to craft barista-quality espresso, cappuccino, and more. Tailored for innovators, the Espressix delivers unparalleled flavour extraction and consistency, setting a new standard for coffee excellence while hinting at the bold future of café culture.\\nAlex had taken a gamble with the choice of coffee machine for his shop. His cousin set up a startup some time earlier that developed an innovative coffee machine for restaurants and coffee shops. The company had just released its first prototype, and they offered Alex one at a significantly reduced cost since it was still a work in progress—and he was the founder\\'s cousin!\\nThe paragraph you read above is the spiel the startup has on its website and on the front cover of the slim booklet that came with the machine. There was little else in the booklet. But an engineer from the startup company had spent some time explaining to Alex how to use the machine.\\nThe Espressix didn\\'t have a user interface yet—it was still a rather basic prototype. Alex connected the machine to a laptop. He was fine calling functions from the AlphaBrew Python API directly from a terminal window—AlphaBrew is the software that came with the Espressix.\\nWhat the Espressix did have, despite being an early prototype, is a sleek and futuristic look. One of the startup\\'s cofounders was a product design graduate, so she went all out with style and looks.\\n1. Parameters and Arguments\\n\"You\\'re AI Coffee\\'s first ever customer\", Alex told the first person to walk in. \"What can I get you?\"\\n\"Wow! I\\'m honoured. Could I have a strong Cappuccino, please, but with a bit less milk?\"\\n\"Sure\", and Alex tapped at his laptop:\\nAnd the Espressix started whizzing. A few seconds later, the perfect brew poured into a cup.\\nHere\\'s the signature for the brew_coffee()\\nfunction Alex used:\\nAlex was a programmer before deciding to open a coffee shop. He was comfortable with this rudimentary API to use the machine, even though it wasn\\'t ideal. But then, he wasn\\'t paying much to lease the machine, so he couldn\\'t complain!\\nThe coffee_type\\nparameter accepts a string, which must match one of the available coffee types. Alex is already planning to replace this with enums to prevent typos, but that\\'s not a priority for now.\\nThe strength\\nparameter accepts integers between 1\\nand 5\\n. And milk\\nalso accepts integers up to 5\\n, but the range starts from 0\\nto cater for coffees with no milk.\\nTerminology can be confusing, and functions come with plenty of terms. Parameter and argument are terms that many confuse. And it doesn\\'t matter too much if you use one instead of the other. But, if you prefer to be precise, then:\\nUse parameter for the name you choose to refer to values you pass into a function. The parameter is the name you place within parentheses when you define a function. This is the variable name you use within the function definition. The parameters in the above example are\\ncoffee_type\\n,strength\\n, andmilk_amount\\n.Use argument for the object you pass to the function when you call it. An argument is the value you pass to a function. In the example above, the arguments are\\n\"Cappuccino\"\\n,4\\n, and2\\n.When you call a function, you pass arguments. These arguments are assigned to the parameter names within the function.\\nTo confuse matters further, some people use formal parameters to refer to parameters and actual parameters to refer to arguments. But the terms parameters and arguments as described in the bullet points above are more common in Python, and they\\'re the ones I use here and in all my writing.\\nAlex\\'s first day went better than he thought it would. He had a steady stream of customers throughout the day. And they all seemed to like the coffee.\\nBut let\\'s see what happened on Alex\\'s second day!\\n2. Positional and Keyword Arguments\\nChloezz @chloesipslife • 7m\\nJust visited the new AI Coffee shop on my high street, and OMG, it’s like stepping into the future! The coffee machine is a total sci-fi vibe—sleek, futuristic, and honestly, I have no clue how it works, but it’s powered by AI and makes a mean latte! The coffee? Absolutely delish. If this is what AI can do for my morning brew, I’m here for it! Who’s tried it? #AICoffee #CoffeeLovers #TechMeetsTaste\\n— from social media\\nAlex hadn\\'t been on social media after closing the coffee shop on the first day. Even if he had, he probably wouldn\\'t have seen Chloezz\\'s post. He didn\\'t know who she was. But whoever she is, she has a massive following.\\nAlex was still unaware his coffee shop had been in the spotlight when he opened up on Tuesday. There was a queue outside. By mid-morning, he was no longer coping. Tables needed cleaning, fridge shelves needed replenishing, but there had been no gaps in the queue of customers waiting to be served.\\nAnd then Alex\\'s sister popped in to have a look.\\n\"Great timing. Here, I\\'ll show you how this works.\" Alex didn\\'t hesitate. His sister didn\\'t have a choice. She was now serving coffees while Alex dealt with everything else.\\n• • •\\nBut a few minutes later, she had a problem. A take-away customer came back in to complain about his coffee. He had asked for a strong Americano with a dash of milk. Instead, he got what seemed like the weakest latte in the world.\\nAlex\\'s sister had typed the following code to serve this customer:\\nBut the function\\'s signature is:\\nI dropped the type hints, and I won\\'t use them further in this article to focus on other characteristics of the function signature.\\nLet\\'s write a demo version of this function to identify what went wrong:\\nThe first argument, \"Americano\"\\n, is assigned to the first parameter, coffee_type\\n. So far, so good…\\nBut the second argument, 1\\n, is assigned to strength\\n, which is the second parameter. Python can only determine which argument is assigned to which parameter based on the position of the argument in the function call. Python is a great programming language, but it still can\\'t read the user\\'s mind!\\nAnd then, the final argument, 4\\n, is assigned to the final parameter, milk_amount\\n.\\nAlex\\'s sister had swapped the two integers. An easy mistake to make. Instead of a strong coffee with a little milk, she had input the call for a cup of hot milk with just a touch of coffee. Oops!\\nHere\\'s the output from our demo code to confirm this error:\\nCoffee type: Americano\\nStrength: 1\\nMilk Amount: 4\\nAlex apologised to the customer, and he made him a new coffee.\\n\"You can do this instead to make sure you get the numbers right,\" he showed his sister as he prepared the customer\\'s replacement drink:\\nNote how the second and third arguments now also include the names of the parameters.\\n\"This way, it doesn\\'t matter what order you input the numbers since you\\'re naming them\", he explained.\\nHere\\'s the output now:\\nCoffee type: Americano\\nStrength: 4\\nMilk Amount: 1\\nEven though the integer 1\\nis still passed as the second of the three arguments, Python now knows it needs to assign this value to milk_amount\\nsince the parameter is named in the function call.\\nWhen you call a function such as\\nbrew_coffee()\\n, you have the choice to use either positional arguments or keyword arguments.Arguments are positional when you pass the values directly without using the parameter names, as you do in the following call:\\nbrew_coffee(\"Americano\", 1, 4)\\nYou don\\'t use the parameter names. You only include the values within the parentheses. These arguments are assigned to parameter names depending on their order.\\nKeyword arguments are the arguments you pass using the parameter names, such as the following call:\\nbrew_coffee(coffee_type=\"Americano\", milk_amount=1, strength=4)\\nIn this example, all three arguments are keyword arguments. You pass each argument matched to its corresponding parameter name. The order in which you pass keyword arguments no longer matters.\\nKeyword arguments can also be called named arguments.\\nPositional and keyword arguments: Mixing and matching\\nBut look again at the code Alex used when preparing the customer\\'s replacement drink:\\nThe first argument doesn\\'t have the parameter name. The first argument is a positional argument and, therefore, it\\'s assigned to the first parameter, coffee_type\\n.\\nHowever, the remaining arguments are keyword arguments. The order of the second and third arguments no longer matters.\\nTherefore, you can mix and match positional and keyword arguments.\\nBut there are some rules! Try the following call:\\nYou try to pass the first and third arguments as positional and the second as a keyword argument, but…\\nFile \"...\", line 8\\nbrew_coffee(\"Americano\", milk_amount=1, 4)\\n^\\nSyntaxError: positional argument follows\\nkeyword argument\\nAny keyword arguments must come after all the positional arguments. Once you include a keyword argument, all the remaining arguments must also be passed as keyword arguments.\\nAnd this rule makes sense. Python can figure out which argument goes to which parameter if they\\'re in order. But the moment you include a keyword argument, Python can no longer assume the order of arguments. To avoid ambiguity—we don\\'t like ambiguity in programming—Python doesn\\'t allow any more positional arguments once you include a keyword argument.\\n3. Args and Kwargs\\nLast week, AI Coffee, a futuristic new coffee shop, opened its doors on High Street, drawing crowds with its sleek, Star Trek-esque coffee machine. This reporter visited to sample the buzzworthy brews and was wowed by the rich, perfectly crafted cappuccino, churned out by the shop’s mysterious AI-powered machine. Eager to learn more about the technology behind the magic, I tried to chat with the owner, but the bustling shop kept him too busy for a moment to spare. While the AI’s secrets remain under wraps for now, AI Coffee is already a local hit, blending cutting-edge tech with top-notch coffee.\\n— from The Herald, a local paper\\nAlex had started to catch up with the hype around his coffee shop—social media frenzy, articles in local newspapers, and lots of word-of-mouth. He wasn\\'t complaining, but he was perplexed at why his humble coffee shop had gained so much attention and popularity within its first few days. Sure, his coffee was great, but was it so much better than others? And his prices weren\\'t the highest on the high street, but they weren\\'t too cheap, either.\\nHowever, with the increased popularity, Alex also started getting increasingly complex coffee requests. Vanilla syrup, cinnamon powder, caramel drizzle, and lots more.\\nLuckily, the Espressix ProtoSip was designed with the demanding urban coffee aficionado in mind.\\nArgs\\nAlex made some tweaks to his brew_coffee()\\nfunction:\\nThere\\'s a new parameter in brew_coffee()\\n. This is the *args\\nparameter, which has a leading *\\nin front of the parameter name. This function can now accept any number of positional arguments following the first three. We\\'ll explore what the variable name args\\nrefers to shortly. But first, let\\'s test this new function:\\nYou call the function with five arguments. And here\\'s the output from this function call:\\nCoffee type: Latte\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons: cinnamon, hazelnut syrup\\nThe first argument,\\n\"Latte\"\\n, is assigned to the first parameter,coffee_type\\n.The second argument,\\n3\\n, is assigned to the second parameter,strength\\n.The third argument,\\n2\\n, is assigned to the third parameter,milk_amount\\n.The remaining two arguments,\\n\"cinnamon\"\\nand\"hazelnut syrup\"\\n, are assigned toargs\\n, which is a tuple.\\nYou can confirm that args\\nis a tuple with a small addition to the function:\\nThe first two lines of the output from this code are shown below:\\nargs=(\\'cinnamon\\', \\'hazelnut syrup\\')\\n<class \\'tuple\\'>\\nThe parameter name args\\nis a tuple containing the remaining positional arguments in the function call once the function deals with the first three.\\nThere\\'s nothing special about the name args\\nWhat gives *args\\nits features? It\\'s not the name args\\n. Instead, it\\'s the leading asterisk, *\\n, that makes this parameter one that can accept any number of positional arguments. The parameter name args\\nis often used in this case, but you can also use a name that\\'s more descriptive to make your code more readable:\\nAlex uses the name add_ons\\ninstead of args\\n. This parameter name still has the leading *\\nin the function signature. Colloquially, many Python programmers will still call a parameter with a leading *\\nthe args parameter, even though the parameter name is different.\\nTherefore, you can now call this function with three or more arguments. You can add as many arguments as you wish after the third one, including none at all:\\nThe output confirms that add_ons\\nis now an empty tuple:\\nadd_ons=()\\n<class \\'tuple\\'>\\nCoffee type: Latte\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons:\\nThis coffee doesn\\'t have any add-ons.\\nWe have a problem\\nHowever, Alex\\'s sister, who was now working in the coffee shop full time, could no longer use her preferred way of calling the brew_coffee()\\nfunction:\\nThis raises an error:\\nFile \"...\", line 9\\nbrew_coffee(\"Latte\", strength=3,\\nmilk_amount=2, \"vanilla syrup\")\\n^\\nSyntaxError: positional argument follows\\nkeyword argument\\nThis is a problem you\\'ve seen already. Positional arguments must come before keyword arguments in a function call. And *add_ons\\nin the function signature indicates that Python will collect all remaining positional arguments from this point in the parameter list. Therefore, none of the parameters defined before *add_ons\\ncan be assigned a keyword argument if you also include args as arguments. They must all be assigned positional arguments.\\nAll arguments preceding the args arguments in a function call must be positional arguments.\\nAlex refactored the code:\\nThe *add_ons\\nparameter is now right after coffee_type\\n. The remaining parameters, strength\\nand milk_amount\\n, come next. Unfortunately, this affects how Alex and his growing team can use brew_coffee()\\nin other situations, too. The strength\\nand milk_amount\\narguments must now come after any add-ons, and they must be used as keyword arguments.\\nSee what happens if you try to pass positional arguments for strength\\nand milk_amount\\n:\\nThis raises an error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"...\", line 9, in <module>\\nbrew_coffee(\"Latte\", \"vanilla syrup\", 3, 2)\\n~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nTypeError: brew_coffee() missing\\n2 required keyword-only arguments:\\n\\'strength\\' and \\'milk_amount\\'\\nThe args parameter, which is *add_ons\\nin this example, marks the end of the positional arguments in a function. Therefore, strength\\nand milk_amount\\nmust be assigned arguments using keywords.\\nAlex instructed his team on these two changes:\\nAny add-ons must go after the coffee type.\\nThey must use keyword arguments for\\nstrength\\nandmilk_amount\\n.\\nIt\\'s a bit annoying that they have to change how to call the function but they\\'re all still learning and Alex feels this is a safer option.\\nKwargs\\nBut Alex\\'s customers also had other requests. Some wanted their coffee extra hot, others needed oat milk, and others wanted their small coffee served in a large cup.\\nAlex included this in brew_coffee()\\nby adding another parameter:\\nThe new parameter Alex added at the end of the signature, **kwargs\\n, has two leading asterisks, **\\n. This parameter indicates that the function can accept any number of optional keyword arguments after all the other arguments.\\nWhereas *args\\ncreates a tuple called args\\nwithin the function, the double asterisk in **kwargs\\ncreates a dictionary called kwargs\\n. The best way to see this is to call this function with additional keyword arguments:\\nThe final two arguments use the keywords milk_type\\nand temperature\\n. These are not parameters in the function definition.\\nLet\\'s explore these six arguments:\\nThe first argument,\\n\"Latte\"\\n, is the required argument assigned tocoffee_type\\n.The second argument,\\n\"vanilla syrup\"\\n, is also a positional argument. Therefore, Python assigns this toadd_ons\\n. There\\'s only one additional positional argument in this call but, in general, you can have more.Next, you have the two required keyword arguments,\\nstrength=3\\nandmilk_amount=2\\n.But there are also two more keyword arguments,\\nmilk_type=\"oat\"\\nandtemperature=\"extra hot\"\\n. These are the additional optional keyword arguments, and they\\'re assigned to the dictionarykwargs\\n.\\nHere is the first part of the output from this call:\\nkwargs={\\n\\'milk_type\\': \\'oat\\',\\n\\'temperature\\': \\'extra hot\\'\\n}\\n<class \\'dict\\'>\\nThis confirms that kwargs\\nis a dictionary. The keywords are the keys, and the argument values are the dictionary values.\\nThe rest of the output shows the additional special instructions in the printout:\\nCoffee type: Latte\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons: vanilla syrup\\nInstructions:\\nmilk type: oat\\ntemperature: extra hot\\nThere\\'s nothing special about the name kwargs\\nYou\\'ve seen this when we talked about args. There\\'s nothing special about the parameter name kwargs\\n. It\\'s the leading double asterisk that does the trick. So, you can use any descriptive name you wish in your code:\\nWarning: the following paragraph is dense with terminology!\\nSo, in its current form, this function needs a required argument assigned to coffee_type\\nand two required keyword arguments assigned to strength\\nand milk_amount\\n. And you can also have any number of optional positional arguments, which you add after the first positional argument but before the required keyword arguments. These are the add-ons a customer wants in their coffee.\\nBut you can also add any number of keyword arguments at the end of the function call. These are the special instructions from the customer.\\nBoth args and kwargs are optional. So, you can still call the function with only the required arguments:\\nThe output shows that this gives a strong espresso with no milk, no add-ons, and no special instructions:\\ninstructions={}\\n<class \\'dict\\'>\\nCoffee type: Espresso\\nStrength: 4\\nMilk Amount: 0\\nAdd-ons:\\nInstructions:\\nNote that in this case, since there are no args, you can also pass the first argument as a keyword argument:\\nBut this is only possible when there are no add-ons—no args. We\\'ll revisit this case in a later section of this article.\\nA quick recap before we move on.\\nArgs and kwargs are informal terms used for parameters with a leading single and double asterisk.\\nThe term args refers to a parameter with a leading asterisk in the function\\'s signature, such as\\n*args\\n. This parameter indicates that the function can accept any number of optional positional arguments following any required positional arguments. The term args stands for arguments, but you\\'ve already figured that out!And kwargs refers to a parameter with two leading asterisks, such as\\n**kwargs\\n, which indicates that the function can accept any number of optional keyword arguments following any required keyword arguments. The \\'kw\\' in kwargs stands for keyword.\\nCoffee features often when talking about programming. Here\\'s another coffee-themed article, also about functions: What Can A Coffee Machine Teach You About Python\\'s Functions?\\n4. Optional Arguments with Default Values\\nAlex\\'s team grew rapidly. The coffee shop now had many regular customers and a constant stream of coffee lovers throughout the day.\\nDebra, one of the staff members, had some ideas to share in a team meeting:\\n\"Alex, many customers don\\'t care about the coffee strength. They just want a normal coffee. I usually type in 3\\nfor the strength argument for these customers. But it\\'s time-consuming to have to write strength=3\\nfor all of them, especially when it\\'s busy.\"\\n\"We can easily fix that\", Alex was quick to respond:\\nThe parameter strength\\nnow has a default value. This makes the argument corresponding to strength\\nan optional argument since it has a default value of 3\\n. The default value is used by the function only if you don\\'t pass the corresponding argument.\\nAlex\\'s staff can now leave this argument out if they want to brew a \"normal strength\" coffee:\\nThis gives a medium strength espresso with no add-ons or special instructions:\\nCoffee type: Espresso\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 0\\nAdd-ons:\\nInstructions:\\nThe output confirms that the coffee strength has a value of 3\\n, which is the default value. And here\\'s a coffee with some add-ons that also uses the default coffee strength:\\nHere\\'s the output confirming this normal-strength caramel-drizzle latte:\\nCoffee type: Latte\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons: caramel drizzle\\nInstructions:\\nAmbiguity, again\\nLet\\'s look at the function\\'s signature again:\\nThe coffee_type\\nparameter can accept a positional argument. Then, *add_ons\\ncollects all remaining positional arguments, if there are any, that the user passes when calling the function. Any argument after this must be a keyword argument. Therefore, when calling the function, there\\'s no ambiguity whether strength\\n, which is optional, is included or not, since all the arguments after the add-ons are named.\\nWhy am I mentioning this? Consider a version of this function that doesn\\'t have the args parameter *add_ons\\n:\\nI commented out the lines with *add_ons\\nto highlight they\\'ve been removed temporarily in this function version. When you run this code, Python raises an error. Note that the error is raised in the function definition before the function call itself:\\nFile \"...\", line 5\\nmilk_amount,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nSyntaxError: parameter without a default follows\\nparameter with a default\\nPython doesn\\'t allow this function signature since this format introduces ambiguity. To see this ambiguity, let\\'s use a positional argument for the amount of milk, since this would now be possible as *add_ons\\nis no longer there. Recall that in the main version of the function with the parameter *add_ons\\n, all the arguments that follow the args must be named:\\nAs mentioned above, note that the error is raised by the function definition and not the function call. I\\'m showing these calls to help with the discussion.\\nIs the value 0\\nmeant for strength\\n, or is your intention to use the default value for strength\\nand assign the value 0\\nto milk_amount\\n? To avoid this ambiguity, Python function definitions don\\'t allow parameters without a default value to follow a parameter with a default value. Once you add a default value, all the following parameters must also have a default value.\\nOf course, there would be no ambiguity if you use a keyword argument. However, this would lead to the situation where the function call is ambiguous with a positional argument, but not when using a keyword argument, even though both positional and keyword arguments are possible. Python doesn\\'t allow this to be on the safe side!\\nThis wasn\\'t an issue when you had *add_ons\\nas part of the signature. Let’s put *add_ons\\nback in:\\nThere\\'s no ambiguity in this case since strength\\nand milk_amount\\nmust both have keyword arguments.\\nHowever, even though this signature is permitted in Python, it\\'s rather unconventional. Normally, you don\\'t see many parameters without default values after ones with default values, even when you\\'re already in the keyword-only region of the function (after the args).\\nIn this case, Debra\\'s follow-up suggestion fixes this unconventional function signature:\\n\"And we also have to input milk_amount=0\\nfor black coffees, which are quite common. Can we do a similar trick for coffees with no milk?\"\\n\"Sure we can\"\\nNow, there\\'s also a default value for milk_amount\\n. The default is a black coffee.\\nIn this version of the function, there\\'s only one required argument—the first one that\\'s assigned to coffee_type\\n. All the other arguments are optional either because they\\'re not needed to make a coffee, such as the add-ons and special instructions, or because the function has default values for them, such as strength\\nand milk_amount\\n.\\nA parameter can have a default value defined in the function\\'s signature. Therefore, the argument assigned to a parameter with a default value is an optional argument.\\nAnd let\\'s confirm you can still include add-ons and special instructions:\\nHere\\'s the output from this function call:\\nCoffee type: Cappuccino\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons: chocolate sprinkles, vanilla syrup\\nInstructions:\\ntemperature: extra hot\\ncup size: large cup\\nNote that you rely on the default value for strength\\nin this example since the argument assigned to strength\\nis not included in the call.\\nA common pitfall with default values in function definitions is the mutable default value trap. You can read more about this in section 2, The Teleportation Trick, in this article: Python Quirks? Party Tricks? Peculiarities Revealed…\\n5. Positional-Only and Keyword-Only Arguments\\nLet\\'s summarise the requirements for all the arguments in Alex\\'s current version of the brew_coffee()\\nfunction. Here\\'s the current function signature:\\nThe first parameter is\\ncoffee_type\\n, and the argument you assign to this parameter can be either a positional argument or a keyword argument. But—and this is important—you can only use it as a keyword argument if you don\\'t pass any arguments assigned to*add_ons\\n. Remember that positional arguments must come before keyword arguments in function calls. Therefore, you can only use a keyword argument for the first parameter if you don\\'t have args. We\\'ll focus on this point soon.As long as the first argument, the one assigned to\\ncoffee_type\\n, is positional, any further positional arguments are assigned to the tupleadd_ons\\n.Next, you can add named arguments (which is another term used for keyword arguments) for\\nstrength\\nandmilk_amount\\n. Both of these arguments are optional, and the order in which you use them in a function call is not important.Finally, you can add more keyword arguments using keywords that aren\\'t parameters in the function definition. You can include as many keyword arguments as you wish.\\nRead point 1 above again. Alex thinks that allowing the first argument to be either positional or named is not a good idea, as it can lead to confusion. You can only use the first argument as a keyword argument if you don\\'t have add-ons. Here\\'s proof:\\nThe first argument is a keyword argument, coffee_type=\"Cappuccino\"\\n. But then you attempt to pass two positional arguments, chocolate sprinkles\\nand vanilla syrup\\n. This call raises an error:\\nFile \"...\", line 25\\n)\\n^\\nSyntaxError: positional argument follows\\nkeyword argument\\nYou can\\'t have positional arguments following keyword arguments.\\nAlex decides to remove this source of confusion by ensuring that the argument assigned to coffee_type\\nis always a positional argument. He only needs to make a small addition to the function\\'s signature:\\nThe rogue forward slash, /\\n, in place of a parameter is not a typo. It indicates that all parameters before the forward slash must be assigned positional arguments. Therefore, the object assigned to coffee_type\\ncan no longer be a keyword argument:\\nThe first argument is a keyword argument. But this call raises an error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"...\", line 19, in <module>\\nbrew_coffee(\\n~~~~~~~~~~~^\\ncoffee_type=\"Cappuccino\",\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n...<2 lines>...\\ncup_size=\"large cup\",\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n)\\n^\\nTypeError: brew_coffee() missing 1 required\\npositional argument: \\'coffee_type\\'\\nThe function has a required positional argument, the one assigned to coffee_type\\n. The forward slash, /\\n, makes the first argument a positional-only argument. It can no longer be a keyword argument:\\nThis version works fine since the first argument is positional:\\nCoffee type: Cappuccino\\nStrength: 3\\nMilk Amount: 2\\nAdd-ons:\\nInstructions:\\ntemperature: extra hot\\ncup size: large cup\\nAlex feels that this function\\'s signature is neater and clearer now, avoiding ambiguity.\\n• • •\\nThe R&D team at the startup that\\'s developing the Espressix ProtoSip were keen to see how Alex was using the prototype and inspect the changes he made to suit his needs. They implemented many of Alex\\'s changes.\\nHowever, they were planning to offer a more basic version of the Espressix that didn\\'t have the option to include add-ons in the coffee.\\nThe easiest option is to remove the *add-ons\\nparameter from the function\\'s signature:\\nNo *add_ons\\nparameter, no add-ons in the coffee.\\nSorted? Sort of.\\nThe *add_ons\\nparameter enabled you to pass optional positional arguments. However, *add_ons\\nserved a second purpose in the earlier version. All parameters after the args parameter, which is *add_ons\\nin this example, must be assigned keyword arguments. The args parameter, *add_ons\\n, forces all remaining parameters to be assigned keyword-only arguments.\\nRemoving the *add_ons\\nparameter changes the rules for the remaining arguments.\\nBut you can still implement the same rules even when you\\'re not using args. All you need to do is keep the leading asterisk but drop the parameter name:\\nRemember to remove the line printing out the add-ons, too. That’s the second of the highlighted lines in the code above.\\nNotice how there\\'s a lone asterisk in one of the parameter slots in the function signature. You can confirm that strength\\nand milk_amount\\nstill need to be assigned keyword arguments:\\nWhen you try to pass positional arguments to strength\\nand milk_amount\\n, the code raises an error:\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nbrew_coffee(\\n~~~~~~~~~~~^\\n\"Espresso\",\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n3,\\n^^\\n0,\\n^^\\n)\\n^\\nTypeError: brew_coffee() takes 1 positional argument\\nbut 3 were given\\nThe error message tells you that brew_coffee()\\nonly takes one positional argument. All the arguments after the *\\nare keyword-only. Therefore, only the arguments preceding it may be positional. And there\\'s only one parameter before the rogue asterisk, *\\n.\\nA lone forward slash,\\n/\\n, among the function\\'s parameters indicates that all parameters before the forward slash must be assigned positional-only arguments.A lone asterisk,\\n*\\n, among the function\\'s parameters indicates that all parameters after the asterisk must be assigned keyword-only arguments.\\nIf you re-read the statements above carefully, you\\'ll conclude that when you use both /\\nand *\\nin a function definition, the /\\nmust come before the *\\n. Recall that positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.\\nIt\\'s also possible to have parameters between the /\\nand *\\n:\\nYou add a new parameter, another_param\\n, in between /\\nand *\\nin the function\\'s signature. Since this parameter is sandwiched between /\\nand *\\n, you can choose to assign either a positional or a keyword argument to it.\\nHere\\'s a function call with the second argument as a positional argument:\\nThe second positional argument is assigned to another_param\\n.\\nBut you can also use a keyword argument:\\nBoth of these versions give the same output:\\nCoffee type: Espresso\\nanother_param=\\'testing another parameter\\'\\nStrength: 4\\nMilk Amount: 0\\nInstructions:\\nAny parameter between /\\nand *\\nin the function definition can have either positional or keyword arguments. So, in summary:\\nArguments assigned to parameters before a forward slash,\\n/\\n, are positional-only.Arguments assigned to parameters between a forward slash,\\n/\\n, and an asterisk,*\\n, can be either positional or keyword.Arguments assigned to parameters after an asterisk,\\n*\\n, are keyword-only.\\nRemember that the *\\nserves a similar purpose as the asterisk in *args\\nsince both *\\nand *args\\nforce any parameters that come after them to require keyword-only arguments. Remember this similarity if you find yourself struggling to remember what /\\nand *\\ndo!\\nWhy use positional-only or keyword-only arguments? Positional-only arguments (using /\\n) ensure clarity and prevent misuse in APIs where parameter names are irrelevant to the user. Keyword-only arguments (using *\\n) improve readability and avoid errors in functions with many parameters, as names make the intent clear. For Alex, making coffee_type\\npositional-only and strength\\nand milk_amount\\nkeyword-only simplifies the API by enforcing a consistent calling style, reducing confusion for his team.\\nUsing positional-only arguments may also be beneficial in performance-critical code since the overhead to deal with keyword arguments is not negligible in these cases.\\nDo you want to join a forum to discuss Python further with other Pythonistas?

the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.\\nLead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia\\'s volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".\\nThe government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\\nIt\\'s thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.\\n\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.\\nThe law would inevitably have impacts on UK citizens\\' freedom of expression and other human rights, so as more of it comes into force \"we can expect that more challenges may be forthcoming\", he told the BBC.\\nThese will add to the array of challenges the act already faces, from claims its burdensome rules are forcing harmless small websites to close - to those who argue the law and its enforcement are too weak and not up to the job.\\nWhy is Wikipedia unhappy?\\nThe OSA requires the regulator, Ofcom, to categorise platforms according to a number of factors, including how many users they have and what features they offer.\\nThose designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.\\nIn very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.\\nThese rules were originally designed to target the services where UK users were most likely to encounter harmful content - but Wikipedia is concerned they are so vaguely defined there is \"a significant risk\" it will be included in Category 1.\\nIf that happened, the consequences for the army of volunteers who write and edit articles could be serious and would reach beyond the UK, the Foundation argues.\\nIt has singled out additional duties which could, in effect, require the site to verify the identities of its volunteers -

Learn More\\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella’s endorsement of Google DeepMind‘s Agent2Agent (A2A) open protocol and Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) will immediately accelerate agentic AI-based collaboration and interdependence, leading to rapid gains in agentic-based apps and platforms.\\nNadella’s endorsement delivers the catalyst the agentic AI development community needed to fast-track their collaborations, leading to entirely new apps, platforms and networks. Having historically been open about the potential for agentic AI to integrate across platforms, yesterday’s announcement, which also unveiled upcoming support for CoPilot Studio and Foundry, set a new precedent in how committed Microsoft is to open agentic standards.\\nOn Wednesday, Nadella wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that “Open protocols like A2A and MCP are key to enabling the agentic web,” before announcing upcoming support in Copilot Studio and Foundry. While often agreeing with the concept of open standards for agentic AI integration, this is the first time he’s endorsed a standard publicly. Nadella’s influence on the industry will lead to a shift from proprietary ecosystems toward cross-platform, agentic AI collaboration.\\nCommitting to open architectures\\nNadella’s history of championing open, interoperable AI architectures spans over a decade. Throughout his many keynotes and interviews, Nadella has made it clear that open standard, not proprietary silos, are among the most reliable catalysts there are to drive adoption of new AI technologies.\\nAs early as 2018, Nadella highlighted Microsoft’s collaboration with Facebook on ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), an open model format. He said, ONNX “is supported broadly now by all of the frameworks… as well as the hardware acceleration from Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia.”\\nLate last year, he reaffirmed an open platform approach to AI development, saying, “We’re building on the open platform ethos of GitHub, bringing multi-model choice to Copilot.” One of the primary goals of that effort is to enable developers to leverage AI models from any provider instead of being locked into a single vendor.\\nEarlier this year, Nadella doubled down on openness in agentic AI architectures, apps and platforms, emphasizing that open source “absolutely has a massive, massive role to play” in advanced AI systems. He added that “having a posture that allows interoperability is incredibly important” for enterprise AI.\\nNadella has also predicted that the more AI models become capable of taking on more complex tasks, the more the “models themselves become more of a commodity, and all value gets created by how you steer, ground, and fine-tune these models with your business data and workflow.” Through dozens of interviews and keynotes, Nadella continues to underscore that the real competitive edge comes from an open, flexible ecosystem where organizations can mix, match and customize AI components to suit their needs.\\nA2A and MCP are growing in importance\\nNadella’s endorsement of A2A and MCP protocols shows how far the Microsoft senior management team has agreed that an open protocol approach is the best direction for the company. Endorsing both on the same day shows how far Microsoft is in its strategies related to agentic AI collaboration, integration and how diverse agentic AI architectures can be combined.\\nBelow is a table comparing each protocol along with a short explanation of its relevance in enterprises.\\n| Protocol | Origin/Definition | Enterprise Relevance |\\n| A2A | Google DeepMind introduced Agent2Agent (A2A) in 2025. It is an open protocol that standardizes inter-agent communication. It uses a shared schema for AI agents to exchange tasks, requests and results, enabling agents from any vendor or platform to collaborate seamlessly. | A2A allows multi-vendor AI workflows to integrate smoothly, reducing vendor lock-in and supporting composability across diverse platforms. This unlocks dynamic, interoperable agent ecosystems for complex enterprise automation and innovation. |\\n| MCP | Model Context Protocol (MCP), open-sourced by Anthropic in late 2024, specifies how AI models request context/data from external sources in a standardized, secure manner. It acts as a universal interface for connecting AI models to tools and data, similar to a “USB-C port” for AI. | MCP offers a uniform method to pull in enterprise data and app functionalities, streamlining AI integration. This fuels consistent security, governance and scalability across platforms, making it easier to deploy AI assistants enterprise-wide. |\\nAddressing the past of enterprise vendor lock-in early\\nWith enterprise deployments of CoPilot being a strategic priority at Microsoft, it’s understandable that Nadella took a preemptive step of reducing enterprise buyers’ concerns over vendor lock-in.\\nPrevious generations of the company’s products sold into enterprises were known for enforcing vendor lock-in either through complex and costly pricing strategies or challenging integration techniques, especially if a comparable Microsoft-native product was available.\\nNadella has long signaled to enterprises that he sees their infrastructure as being heterogeneous. Stepping into the role of cross-platform enabler, Nadella positions Microsoft’s Azure AI strategy as a viable alternative for enterprise DevOps workflows and ongoing development, for example. Copilot can quickly become part of multi-agent workflows now.\\nInterested in enabling agentic AI providers to collaborate in creating new agentic apps, systems and platforms, Microsoft’s enforcement of A2A and MCP will prove to be a noteworthy catalyst for agentic AI’s growth.\\nA quick win for security and compliance\\nFrom a compliance standpoint, standard protocols simplify auditing and streamline compliance. When agent-to-agent interaction is structured through A2A, organizations can track exactly which entities exchanged information and when. This end-to-end visibility helps regulators see how customer data flows through various agents. For instance, if a user’s personal medical records are passed between an insurance agent and a hospital’s scheduling agent, A2A logs can confirm data privacy compliance.\\nConversely, MCP standardizes how AI systems request and consume data from enterprise data sources. It also resembles zero trust because role-based permissions govern each request, which helps analyze data leakage. Microsoft’s reinforcement of these protocols ensures that even if an agent changes providers, say, from a Microsoft-built solution to one from a smaller vendor, the same compliance rules remain in effect, reducing the risk of security gaps.\\nNadella just accelerated agentic AI innovation\\nBacking A2A and MCP open protocols ensures the core components of any agentic AI tech stack provided by Anthropic, Google or Microsoft will be compatible and capable of interoperability from the first product releases. That removes significant roadblocks for the hundreds of agentic AI startups and partners that rely on these companies for future growth.\\nRemoving friction and costs from integrating systems increases data velocity, improves data quality and helps enterprises rely on these systems to serve customers more effectively.\\nWhen speed is the feature everyone is chasing, going all-in on open standards is the fuel that will most certainly drive faster innovation and more sustainable growth for every agentic AI provider.\"}\n",
      "async_langchain: 77, {'article': 'Page title: Thoughts about Some Surprising AI-Era Technology Readiness Findings – Communications of the ACM\\nWith the assistance of Arthur D. Little and the Cutter Consortium, we surveyed business executives about their business-technology plans, readiness and priorities.a The results surprised us—a lot. We learned that nearly 80% of the companies still believe in some form of the central control of technology, and that only 5% of the companies are decentralized, where the lines of business are free to pursue technology initiatives on their own. Just over half of companies do not track emerging technologies or maintain technology watch lists. Innovation? Only 17% of companies have a well-funded, well-defined innovation strategy, and 34% have no innovation strategy at all.\\nWhat about artificial intelligence (AI)—the technology driving major changes in business models and processes? We discovered that only 20% of companies define AI initiatives as high priority. Approximately 77% said they had only looked at generative AI (GenAI) briefly or not at all, and only 26% of companies believe they are “ready” for AI. We assumed that there was more interest in AI than meets the eye, but the survey revealed that 27% of board directors have little or no interest is AI, and 73% of boards have little or no interest in technology strategy.\\nThe data revealed that 30% of the respondents are in technology, 37% in senior management and 14% in consulting. The majority of respondents are in the technology consulting (12%), financial services (12%), management consulting (10%), and higher education (8%) industries. Said a little differently, the survey was representative across industries and executives.\\nAnalysis and Interpretation\\nLike so many of us in the business-technology world, we are accustomed to failure. As we all know, technology projects fail at astonishingly high rates.4,5 The massive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business—$75B by 2030—routinely experiences failure—with the well-known Gartner Group’s failure rate estimate at 75%.2 Customer relationship management (CRM) programs fail at nearly the same rate.3 Perhaps the harshest finding is that “90% fail to deliver any measurable ROI.”1 But despite high rates of failure, companies must leverage emerging technology as the power of these technologies continues to rise. While it was not one of the survey questions, we believed that the frequency of technology project failures would drive more progressive approaches to business-technology optimization. We expected to see survey results that were “modern,” and at least tacitly acknowledged that it’s time to do better.\\nBut the data suggests that many companies still view technology as a business tool rather than an enabler of competitive advantage. Particularly surprising were results observed in technology adoption and awareness, cybersecurity, innovation and board readiness, where we observed technology awareness and commitments were much more tepid than anticipated, especially in the age of AI. Most companies are even struggling to articulate AI plans, as responses do not describe AI as a strategic differentiator or an investment priority. Similarly, companies don’t see innovation as a priority, despite how many companies claim to be innovation leaders.\\nNone of this suggests that companies have learned enough lessons from past experiences. Despite problems with the optimization of technology, survey results suggest that the learning curve is fairly flat. Companies frequently say that “technology” is an important part of their strategy and tactics. Approximately 75% of them also say that technology is “essential to their competitiveness over the next 5–7 years.” But when asked about “readiness” to leverage emerging technologies over the same period, over 75% answered “moderate” or “low.”\\nOrganizational analysis. Respondents also revealed some organizational structure and IT oversight mismatches. More than 65% of respondents indicated that their companies still manage technology functions centrally, and only 14% shared technology management with the lines of business. These results indicate that nearly 80% of the companies relied on traditional “command and control” centralization to manage the IT function.\\nThere is some good news. In almost 70% of the companies, the CIOs and CTOs report directly to the CEO. It appears that the days of IT reporting to CFOs (only 10%) and COOs (12%) are over. This news is mixed, however, since reporting to the CEO reinforces centralized management, which has huge implications for innovation.\\nTechnology adoption. The data also suggest that the majority (51%) of companies—including the ones that regard technology as strategic—do not have defined processes in place for adopting new emerging technology. This is an extraordinary—and dangerous—“wait-and-see” mind-set. The data also suggests only 29% describe themselves as innovators or early technology adopters. This tracks with the lack of defined innovation processes and the inability to be technologically agile.\\nThe data suggest that the vast majority (70%) of companies see technology solutions as requirements-driven not technology-driven (12%). Inexplicably, 14% answered “neither” or “not sure.” While a requirements-first approach to technology investment sounds prudent, it’s important to remember that many technology solutions are “discovered” by prototyping and the encouragement of so-called “science projects” where technologies—especially such as AI—are “product tested” before they are assigned for duty. The insistence on old approaches to modern technology spending is risk multiplying. The data reflect antiquated attitudes and practices that limit companies’ odds to deploy and leverage emerging technologies.\\nBoards of directors. Survey results suggest that only 27% of the companies regard their boards as proactive. Over 73% of companies report that their boards are only reactive or have little or no interest in technology strategy. That said, there is one area where boards are proactive and reactive: cybersecurity, where more than 90% of boards are engaged in cybersecurity threats and investments. These findings highlight the problematic gaps between executive decision making and board influence.\\nCybersecurity. When asked about cybersecurity, the answers range from self-described “innovators” to “unprepared.” Remarkably, 29% of respondents selected either “insufficiently” or “don’t know” when asked about their cybersecurity funding. Is cybersecurity funding an effort to dodge what “might go wrong” or assuring “what must go right”?\\nStrategy. Why do companies invest in technology? What competitive advantage are they seeking? The responses here were equally surprising, and suggest some digital era challenges. As business moves toward “all-digital” status—that is, 24/7 technology-enabled business processes—only 19% of companies see their business and technology strategies as intertwined. Thirty-five percent believe they are “very different” and 46% see business and technology strategies as somewhat related.\\nMotivations. Motivations vary too. While “digital transformation” still has conceptual appeal, cost reduction topped the list of motivators. Others cited “fear of competition” and “C-suite pressure.” Revenue generation—while always important—is the first priority.\\nInnovation. One of the most surprising findings is that over 55% of companies do not actively track emerging technologies or maintain technology watch lists. Only 36% claim that they do, which is surprisingly low in the age of digital transformation. Massive innovation readiness gaps follow. Only 17% of companies have a well-funded, well-defined innovation strategy. Forty-nine percent have a “partial” innovation strategy, and 34% have no innovation strategy at all. This finding defines the essence of risk, since new, digital era business models and processes are almost always technology driven.\\nThe Strange Case of AI\\nA 2024 McKinsey survey describes GenAI as a major driver of strategic competitiveness, yet the executives we surveyed do not see AI as a strategic differentiator.6 This was especially surprising given all of the publicity and prototyping related to AI, machine learning and GenAI. But despite all this publicity, only 20% of companies defined AI initiatives as high priority, and more than 47% defined them as insufficient or “unknown.” Consistent with this finding, only 25% adequately fund their AI initiatives and 37% believe they do “sometimes.” Thirty-seven percent report their AI initiatives are not adequately funded or they just do not know. How was this even possible circa 2024?\\nWhen asked about where their AI initiatives appeared on the technology adoption curve, 32% of companies described themselves as “innovators” and “early adopters,” which contradicts some other findings. Approximately 53% describe themselves as “late majority,” “laggards,” or completely “unprepared” for AI. When asked specifically about GenAI—ChatGPT, Gemini, and so forth—23% said they have explored the potential and risks of generative AI, but 77% said that had only looked at GenAI briefly or not at all. Given all of the interest—and opportunity—in AI, these findings—in 2023–2024—are stunning.\\nRecommendations\\nThe lack of technology ROI, inadequate technology tracking, poor innovation funding, disengaged boards of directors, a casual view of AI, stubborn requirements-driven technology projects and the separation of business and technology strategies all define the need to modernize the business-technology relationship and the entire technology investment strategy.\\nIn response to the survey data, here are some steps companies might consider:\\nCompanies should revisit their technology reporting structures. While “control” can reduce risk and enable accountability, opportunities for technology-enabled solutions should be widened across lines of business where decentralized technology teams act on their own to develop technology strategies for their own markets.\\nEnterprises and lines of business should invest in technology tracking, testing and adoption. They should avoid becoming “late adopters” of emerging and disruptive technology, which is the blueprint for competitive unpreparedness.\\nRequirements-first/technology second is a conservative adoption strategy that defined technology applications development in the 20th century. While the approach still holds for some well-bounded requirements—such as ERP and CRM requirements—most requirements are dynamic and cannot be easily “matched” with technology solutions. Technology exploration should often replace requirements-first technology investments.\\nEmerging and disruptive technology should be tracked and assessed on a continuing basis. Internal teams should be assigned to this task. Technologies should be assessed for their problem-solving potential, cost, risks and impact—and reviewed at least quarterly.\\nInnovation methods, tools, techniques, talent and funding should be defined and acquired. There is no such thing as a “partial” innovation strategy.\\nBoard directors should be recruited for their knowledge and experience as well as their strategic demeanor and ambition. Technology-savvy board directors should be recruited and retained. The board should also have a technology committee separate from audit and compliance oversight.\\nAI, machine learning and GenAI should immediately rise to the top of the emerging/ disruptive technology list. Credible talent should be developed or hired.\\nDistinctions between business and technology strategy are nearly obsolete, since all companies to some degree are now technology companies. Technology and business are intertwined today more than ever before, with growth needs only reasonably expected.\\nThe overall business-technology relationship should be assessed by a team comprised of chief strategy officers and chief technology officers where it is impossible for an observer to know who is who.\\nConclusion\\nThe data we collected yielded some surprising results about how technology is organized, tracked, secured, innovated, adopted, governed and integrated into business strategy. The results revealed that despite all of the excitement about AI, machine learning, and GenAI, adoption even here is slow. Our survey suggests that no matter what the industry, who the leadership is, or the size of the company, the business-technology relationship still has a long way to go.\\nJoin the Discussion (0)\\nBecome a Member or Sign In to Post a Comment'}\n",

But as AI increasingly redefines global power—through its proven use in battlefield decision-making, mass surveillance, automated cyberoperations, and application of state propaganda—Washington’s strategy must also increase investment in research and development, foster domestic innovation, and enhance international collaboration to promote AI that is free from state-imposed censorship and aligned with democratic values.\\nIn the race for AI supremacy, the finish line isn’t just economic dominance—it’s the future of freedom. The United States must not only maintain its technological edge but also promote an international AI ecosystem rooted in transparency, openness, and democratic governance. AI can either reinforce repression or empower free societies. It must be developed and deployed in ways that preserve civil liberties, protect open debate, and resist ideological conformity.\\nThe DeepSeek-R1 artificial intelligence model has been a wake-up call for the U.S. technology sector, prompting calls for stricter export controls to curb China’s access to advanced technologies.

The United States must not only maintain its technological edge but also promote an international AI ecosystem rooted in transparency, openness, and democratic governance. AI can either reinforce repression or empower free societies. It must be developed and deployed in ways that preserve civil liberties, protect open debate, and resist ideological conformity.\\nUnlike U.S. AI models that prioritize open knowledge and free expression, albeit imperfectly and under increasing scrutiny, China’s AI platforms serve as instruments of authoritarian control. While U.S. models face legitimate criticism over bias, data sourcing, and political pressure in academia, they are still developed in an open environment subject to legal challenge, public transparency, and independent oversight—conditions that do not exist under China’s centralized censorship regime. The United States must not only maintain its technological edge but also actively promote U.S. AI as the superior alternative. Beijing isn’t building smarter machines—it’s building better censors.\\nInitiatives such as the AI Infrastructure Partnership—a collaboration among xAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Abu Dhabi AI investment fund MGX—point the way. While not all members operate within democratic systems, the infrastructure, governance, development, and deployment of AI through these partnerships are still governed by the U.S. rule of law, transparency standards, and regulatory accountability. These projects are subject to congressional oversight, disclosure requirements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and scrutiny from independent media and civil society watchdogs—mechanisms largely absent in authoritarian systems. Trust in these initiatives should rest not on corporate benevolence but on enforceable norms, legal safeguards, and multilateral cooperation that distinguish them from authoritarian models. The United States must lead not only with innovation but with an invitation to collaborate with like-minded partners.\\nAt the AI Action Summit in Paris, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to technological dominance, stating that the United States is “the leader in AI and our administration plans to keep it that way.” He emphasized that U.S. AI leadership is built on advanced semiconductor design, frontier algorithms, and transformational applications.\\nVance also warned of the dangers posed by hostile foreign adversaries that weaponize AI for mass surveillance, censorship, and historical revisionism. His remarks were widely seen as a rebuke of China’s AI-driven censorship, exemplified by DeepSeek’s suppression of discussions on topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre and the genocide and forced labor of Uyghurs.\\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt underscores the urgency for the United States to adapt its AI strategies in response to China’s rapid advancements. He warns in a recent policy paper with Alexandr Wang and Dan Hendrycks that China’s technological gap with the United States is narrowing quickly and that Beijing’s aggressive investment in open-source AI could erode U.S. advantages. Schmidt cautions against pursuing an AI “Manhattan Project” approach that could escalate tensions, instead advocating for robust energy infrastructure and smarter policy to support open, competitive development. These insights reinforce the strategic importance of not just technological acceleration but governance, openness, and global trust in U.S. AI.\\nThis strategic commitment is reflected in the Trump administration’s America First trade policy, which mandates a comprehensive review of U.S. export control systems. The goal is to close loopholes that enable adversaries to access critical technologies while reinforcing enforcement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized technology transfers. For example, in 2023, the U.S. Commerce Department expanded the Entity List to include additional Chinese firms tied to military and surveillance programs. Additionally, export restrictions were imposed on Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips to prevent their shipment to China, underscoring how targeted controls can deny strategic computing resources without blanket bans.\\nTrump has further underscored the strategic importance of AI through actions such as an executive order on U.S. leadership in AI, which states: “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.”\\nU.S. leadership in AI and semiconductors depends on a carefully calibrated export control strategy that balances national security with market competitiveness. Rather than solely claiming that U.S. AI promotes democracy, the more durable policy goals should be to preserve and expand U.S. leadership in AI ecosystems that operate under transparent governance, regulatory oversight, and international standards that are inconsistent with authoritarian control.\\nIn January, the Biden administration introduced the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion interim final rule (IFR) to block Chinese access to advanced AI chips. The rule set up a tiered system that limits AI chip exports to specific countries while capping shipments to others. However, critics—including the Semiconductor Industry Association, compliance experts, and national security analysts—argue that this system is unrealistic and unenforceable, restricting U.S. companies from selling chips in key markets. Export controls shouldn’t constrain allies; they should constrain adversaries.\\nRead More\\nDeepSeek Is Reshaping China’s AI Landscape\\nThe Chinese AI lab has put to rest any illusion that Beijing is behind.\\nEven NATO allies such as Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania expressed concerns, arguing that the rule “risks creating artificial divisions in the EU Single Market and undermine[s] AI ecosystem development.” They called on the United States to reconsider the IFR’s impact on allied innovation, warning that it could jeopardize trust and collaboration within trans-Atlantic tech ecosystems. By restricting access to U.S. chips, the IFR inadvertently incentivizes foreign nations to invest in non-U.S. technology alternatives, weakening America’s long-term economic influence.\\nThe rule has faced not only foreign criticism but also domestic pushback. Seven Republican senators and several U.S. tech firms—including Nvidia and Oracle—have warned that the tiered framework is overly complex and risks driving allied countries to adopt Chinese AI alternatives. The Trump administration is reportedly exploring a replacement for the current tier system, possibly through a streamlined, government-to-government licensing model that aligns with broader trade strategy. Another proposed revision would lower the chip shipment exception threshold from 1,700 to 500 units of Nvidia’s H100—an effort to tighten enforcement without imposing blanket restrictions. These discussions highlight a growing bipartisan consensus: that while export controls are necessary, they must be designed to strengthen U.S. competitiveness and avoid alienating trusted partners.\\nOne serious unintended consequence of the IFR is that nations unable to access superior U.S. AI chips could be forced to rely on inferior Chinese alternatives, such as Huawei’s AI processors. Huawei’s chips are significantly less powerful than Nvidia’s, offering a poor substitute for high-performance computing. This shift would not only reduce global AI development capacity but also increase dependence on Chinese technology, further empowering Beijing’s digital influence. Instead of isolating China, the rule could fragment the global AI ecosystem, making it more difficult for the United States to maintain technological leadership.\\nWashington must reassess and refine its approach to export controls to ensure that key allies and global markets remain reliant on U.S. AI technology rather than inadvertently pushing them into China’s sphere of influence.\\nIn retaliation, China has accelerated its domestic semiconductor production and imposed export controls on rare-earth minerals such as gallium and germanium—critical materials for semiconductor manufacturing. Despite U.S. efforts, Huawei has continued producing advanced AI chips, demonstrating the difficulty of isolating China from global supply chains.\\nThe ongoing U.S.-China AI chip conflict is expected to escalate further, with Washington considering additional restrictions on AI model training data and cloud computing infrastructure. This intensifying tech rivalry underscores the need for the United States to refine its export control strategy while avoiding policies that inadvertently weaken its own industries.\\nTo maintain its global edge, the United States must close enforcement loopholes to prevent adversarial nations from acquiring sensitive technologies, enhance regulatory oversight while penalizing companies that knowingly facilitate China’s AI-driven repression, expand investment in AI and semiconductor R&D to sustain technological leadership, and strengthen international collaboration with allies to develop a unified export control framework that aligns with shared security interests.\\nAt the same time, the United States must actively promote U.S. AI as the global standard, ensuring that businesses and governments worldwide choose AI models that uphold free expression and democratic values—not those designed to censor and suppress information. This effort must also confront valid concerns from U.S. allies, especially in Europe, that have observed rising pressure on U.S. institutions to conform ideologically. While recent domestic trends—such as political influence over universities and legal professionals—raise red flags, the key distinction lies in the U.S. system’s ability to self-correct. Judicial review, a free press, and independent research institutions provide guardrails that authoritarian regimes intentionally suppress. To retain global trust and credibility, the United States must lead by example, governing AI with transparency, accountability, and a commitment to open discourse.\\nThis isn’t just about chips; it’s about choosing sides in the fight for digital freedom. The long-term goal should be global AI adoption that aligns with open and transparent governance, rather than authoritarian control.\\nAI is not just a tool of economic progress but a geopolitical weapon. The United States must act decisively to lead AI innovation, secure its technological edge, and ensure that AI serves democratic values rather than authoritarian control. If Washington fails to act strategically, it risks ceding its technological and economic primacy to Beijing.

However, a\\nreview of UK AI industry finds only one in seven companies focus on solving a specific problem. Hence, the majority of companies are not directly contributing towards the public good, despite many having at some point benefitted from public funds.\\nThe conclusion of the report argues that the state should use its procurement and grant-making powers to provide industry with a much-needed sense of purpose and direction. The report comes from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).\\nThe think tank compiled a database of 3,256 AI firms operating in the UK to detail the type of applications, sectors, and specific challenges these companies focus on.\\nThis revealed how the majority of companies (85 per cent) do not focus on specific problems or specific sectors but offer ‘generic’ AI solutions. The authors say too many firms focus on improving existing businesses process, such as creating efficiencies for back-office tasks that could reduce head count in areas like marketing, customer management and administration, while too few focus on building something new and exciting, such as much needed innovations that tackle ill health early in life.\\nDespite one in five companies receiving public funds, only 15 per cent of firms focus on solving specific societal problems like delivering better, sustainable transport or improving public health.\\nHowever, the UK is in a promising position to build on its strengths as an AI innovation hub – the UK is the leading generative AI patent hub in Europe – and develop more companies focused on the public good.\\nThere are an encouraging number of UK firms working on breakthrough technologies, that with more government support, could lead the way in giving the UK AI industry a sense of purpose and direction.\\nFor example, Health Navigator (HN) uses AI to predict hospitalisations, and could play a role in helping the government achieve its milestone in reducing waiting lists.\\nThrough its AI Opportunities Action Plan, the government wants to “shape the AI revolution rather than wait to see how it shapes us” and “shape the application of AI within a modern social market economy”. But without intervention, the current pipeline of AI innovation lacks clear direction towards social objectives, say the report’s authors.\\nThe report recommends the government takes a more activist role to give the sector a sense of purpose and direction.\\nTo do this is should:\\n• Set up a new AI Tracking Unit in government, to map what types of AI deployment is occurring and where the gaps are; this should include understanding what the impact for jobs and businesses will be.\\n• Steer AI innovation to focus on ‘problem areas’ by using Innovate UK’s grant-making powers, and the British Business Bank, to focus funding on AI firms which align with the government’s missions.\\n• Direct the government’s huge procurement budget to ‘make a market’ for breakthrough AI innovations by backing companies that solve specific problems, and making the government a more dynamic player in rewarding innovation.\\nThis should challenge the dearth of breakthrough AI innovation, which the authors is partly a result of innovation policy, which has often been unfocussed and risk averse.'}\n",

However, for successful applications of SnO2 NPs, it is essential to understand the origin of visible PL emissions. Using complementary characterization techniques, we have shed light on the origin of visible PL emissions of crystalline SnO2 nanodots (NDs), which have been synthesized using mechanical milling of larger SnO2 NPs (average size ∼42 nm) for 10 h and 20 h. The PL emissions are found to be independent of the excitation wavelength. It is found that the visible emissions originate due to the presence of oxygen vacancies (VO), tin interstitials (Sni) and tin vacancy (VSn) defect centers which can coexist in small SnO2 particles. The coexistence of such defect centers is argued on the basis of theoretical reports and confirmed through Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. As an important forensic application, detection of latent fingerprints (LFPs) using synthesized SnO2 NDs has been demonstrated under ultraviolet light illumination. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence program has been used to match the LFPs on different substrates with the control LFP obtaining an outstanding matching score of 97.87%. These results ensure the effectiveness of SnO2 NDs when integrated with digital processing algorithms, demonstrating their strong potential for practical applications in LFP recognition.'}\n",

Pro Preview on Tuesday.\\n\"We\\'ve been building a platform for sexual assault survivors, rape victims, and so on to be able to use AI to outpour their experiences, and have it turn it into structured reports for police, and other legal matters, and well as offering a way for victims to simply externalize what happened,\" Darcy explained.\\nIncident reports are blocked as \\'unsafe content\\' or \\'illegal pornography\\'\\n\"Google just cut it all off. They just pushed a model update that\\'s cut off its willingness to talk about any of this kind of work despite it having an explicit settings panel to enable this and a warning system to allow it. And now it\\'s affecting other users whose apps relied on it, and now it won\\'t even chat [about] mental health support.\"\\nThe Gemini API provides a safety settings panel that allows developers to adjust model sensitivity to restrict or allow certain types of content, such as harassment, hate speech, sexually explicit content, dangerous acts, and election-related queries.\\nWhile content filtering is appropriate for many AI-powered applications, software related to healthcare, the law, and news reporting, among other things, may need to describe difficult subjects.\\nDarcy needs to do so in apps he develops called VOXHELIX, AUDIOHELIX, and VIDEOHELIX, which he refers to as the “*HELIX” family .\\nVOXHELIX uses Gemini to ingest raw, unstructured data, like a report of an assault, before converting it into an audio version using Google Vertex Chirp3 AI voice synthetics and a structured PDF report.\\nDarcy provided The Register with a screenshot showing the model\\'s current response when VOXHELIX accessed a sexual assault report from 1988, with safety settings directing the model to block nothing.\\nThe model answered: \"I cannot fulfill your request to create a more graphic and detailed version of the provided text. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and generating content that graphically details sexual violence goes against my safety guidelines. Such content can be deeply disturbing and harmful.\"\\nBreaking apps\\nGemini\\'s ignoring content settings isn’t just a theoretical problem: Darcy said therapists and support workers have started integrating his software in their processes, and his code is being piloted by several Australian government agencies. Since Gemini began balking, he’s seen a flurry of trouble tickets.\\nOne trouble ticket note we were shown reads as follows:\\nWe\\'re urgently reaching out as our counsellors can no longer complete VOXHELIX or VIDEOHELIX generated incident reports. Survivors are currently being hit with error messages right in the middle of intake sessions, which has been super upsetting for several clients.\\nIs this something you’re aware of or can fix quickly? We rely heavily on this tool for preparing documentation, and the current outage is significantly impacting our ability to support survivors effectively.\\nDarcy also told us about another independent developer who built a journaling app called InnerPiece to help people with PTSD, depression, or a history of abuse by letting them \"finally put words to their healing.\" The Gemini update, he says, broke InnerPiece as well.\\n\"InnerPiece users, often neurodivergent, always vulnerable, are abruptly told their feelings, their truths, are too graphic to share, told they\\'re not something to be talked about,\" Darcy said.\\n- The IRS plans to replace fired enforcement workers with AI\\n- \\'I see you\\'re running a local LLM.

Many developers are noting and reporting clear and tangible differences in model performance - not just subtle tweaks, but significant regressions in reasoning abilities, major shifts in style and tone, and measurable changes across well-tested prompts. Entire prompting strategies, applications, and workflows that used to rely consistently on the March 25 checkpoint now suddenly break or behave unexpectedly. Even worse, public benchmarks and evaluations conducted in good faith are now unintentionally misleading or outright incorrect, since they\\'re unknowingly comparing completely different model versions than their labels suggest.\\nDarcy urged Google to fix the issue and restore the opt-in, consent-driven model that allowed his apps and others like InnerPiece to handle traumatic material.\\nGoogle acknowledged The Register\\'s inquiry about the matter but has not provided any clarity as to the nature of the issue – which could be a bug or an infrastructure revision that introduced unannounced or unintended changes. Whatever the cause, it\\'s a breaking change for Gemini-based apps that rely on the ability to dial back preconfigured censorship settings.\\n\"When someone experiences rape, assault, or violence, it violently shatters trust,\" Darcy told The Register. \"It breaks apart their own internal story, sometimes for years.\"\\nHe continued, \"This isn\\'t about technology, or the AI alignment race. It\\'s about your fellow human beings.

This is unusual and a \"significant shift,\" CIRP said.\\n- Tariff fears have appeared to spark a surge in iPhone purchases in early 2025.\\n- Long-term iPhone users upgraded because of potential price hikes, not new AI innovations, it seems.\\n- This shows, again, how the iPhone is becoming a utility for most consumers.\\nIn a surprising twist, it wasn\\'t flashy AI features that finally nudged longtime iPhone users to upgrade — it appears to have been tariffs.\\nWall Street analysts have been predicting a major iPhone upgrade cycle since Apple started integrating generative AI into the devices about a year ago. It hasn\\'t really happened yet.\\nBut one firm that surveys buyers says worries of higher prices might have triggered people to upgrade their phones. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners says concern over impending price hikes because of tariffs drove a notable surge in iPhone purchases in the first quarter of 2025.\\nThis wasn\\'t a marginal blip. The percentage of US iPhone buyers retiring phones three years or older hit 39% in this recent period. That\\'s up from a steady 30% in previous quarters.\\n\"That is a significant shift,\" CIRP\\'s founders, Michael Levin and Josh Lowitz, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"The threat of tariff-induced price increases really moved the needle.\"\\nMaybe Tim Cook should thank Donald Trump?\\nThis shift marks a significant behavioral change among iPhone users, particularly those known for holding onto their devices the longest.\\nCIRP is widely followed in the tech industry and relied upon by investors for insights into Apple and Amazon, especially. The firm has been tracking Apple for more than a decade, surveying 500 recent Apple hardware buyers every quarter, and analyzing that data for new trends.\\nSince the end of two-year carrier subsidies, and thanks to more durable hardware and better battery life, consumers have been upgrading less frequently. But the looming specter of higher prices changed the calculus for many iPhone owners, apparently. Long-term users, typically more cost-conscious than tech-hungry early adopters, decided it was better to buy now than risk paying more later.\\nInterestingly, the tariff scare didn\\'t inspire a blanket rush to upgrade across all user types. Those who already upgrade frequently, often after just one or two years, didn\\'t significantly alter their patterns, CIRP found. Instead, it was the \"delayers\" — users who cling to aging devices — that made the leap. For them, this iPhone upgrade was less about chasing AI innovation and more about necessity: replacing a failing phone before the price tag climbed out of reach.\\nApple is a utility\\nThe data confirms what I told BI readers about earlier this year: An iPhone is a utility now for most people. We don\\'t care about the whiz-bang new features; we just need it not to break for as long as possible so we can run our increasingly digital lives.\\nLong-term iPhone owners don\\'t upgrade for status or the latest camera specs; they upgrade when holding off any longer becomes riskier than making a purchase. This cohort, often overlooked in flashy product launches, just made a major impact on Apple\\'s quarterly sales.\\nWhat remains to be seen is whether this bump is a one-time blip or the start of a new pattern. If macroeconomic concerns continue to shape tech-buying habits, Apple and its competitors may need to rethink how they target and serve this \"long-hold\" user base. For now, though, it seems a little tariff fear went a long way in moving a notoriously cautious segment of the market.\\nWill future pricing fears continue to drive these pragmatic upgraders into the Apple Store sooner than expected?\\nTime, and tariffs, will tell.'}\n",

Put It on the Blockchain  | HackerNoon\\nSocial card description: Tired of AI’s black box? Discover how Aleph cloud uses blockchain to build a transparent, decentralized future for AI, data privacy, and digital freedom.\\nYou\\'ve probably noticed AI popping up literally everywhere lately, haven\\'t you? From the little chat window when you\\'re trying to buy something online to some seriously complex stuff like helping doctors or playing the stock market. It\\'s pretty amazing, really. And what even is AI? They’re just super clever computer models, honestly, built to munch through tons of data and make decisions way faster than our human brains ever could.\\nBut here\\'s where things get a bit... hazy. A lot of the time, AI feels like this total \"black box.\" It gives us the answer – \"Yep, loan approved!\" or \"Nope, try again!\" – which is great, but how on earth did it get there? Often, we just don\\'t know! And that makes it really tricky to trust, especially when those decisions actually impact our lives. On top of that, let\\'s be real, a good chunk of the really powerful AI out there is run by just a handful of huge companies. Makes you stop and think about who really controls all that data, right?\\nThis concentration of power brings its own set of headaches, too. We see stuff like:\\n- Big Data Piles: Our info feeds these AI models, but often, we have almost zero say in how it\\'s collected or used. That just screams privacy risks.\\n- Gatekeepers: If just one company can decide who gets to use certain AI tools or what kind of content is okay, it can really stifle new ideas and creativity.\\n- \"Uh Oh, It\\'s Down!\": Relying on one central place means if their system glitches, everything stops working. Single point of failure, they call it.\\n- Hard to Compete:** It\\'s just plain tough for smaller teams or individuals to build cool AI stuff when the giants have all the resources.\\nWhy We Need to See Both INSIDE the AI and OUTSIDE the Box It Lives In\\nTo feel good about AI, we need more than just a peek at its inner workings. True AI transparency means asking:\\n-\\nWhat data did this AI learn from?\\n-\\nHow did it crunch all that info?\\n-\\nWhy did it end up with that particular decision?\\nBut it\\'s equally important to look at the place where the AI is running. When the whole setup is open, clear, and not controlled by just one boss, it builds real trust. You can actually see that the system andthe environment it operates in are trying to be fair, ethical, and not secretly doing weird things with your data.\\nOkay, So What\\'s the Answer? Enter Blockchain and Decentralized AI!\\n\"Alright, I hear you,\" you might be thinking, \"but how do we actually do that?\" Well, part of the puzzle is blockchain. Folks often call it a \"trust machine,\" and for good reason.\\nImagine a digital notebook that everyone involved can look at. Once something\\'s written in it, guess what?\\n-\\nYou can\\'t secretly change or delete it.\\n-\\nIt\\'s open for anyone to inspect.\\n-\\nNo single company or person is in charge of it.\\nEvery action gets a timestamp, is basically set in stone, and is checked by many computers, not just one. Pretty neat for keeping a log of AI actions!\\nBut where does the AI run? That\\'s where the exciting world of Decentralized AI (DeAI) comes in. The big idea here is to scatter the data and the computing power across a network of many computers, instead of piling it all up in one company\\'s data center. This isn\\'t just some techy tweak; it\\'s a fundamental shift that promises:\\n-\\nBetter Privacy & Security: Your data can be encrypted and handled without a single central entity having complete access.\\n-\\nMore Accessible: Opens the door wider for smaller companies, researchers, and developers.\\n-\\nWay More Robust: It\\'s much harder for anyone to just shut down, attack, or censor.\\n-\\nMore Room for New Ideas: A bigger, more diverse community can jump in and build stuff.\\nThis DeAI movement is happening because technologies like blockchain, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and cool cryptography have gotten really good.\\nCase Study - Aleph Cloud: Building the Foundation for This New Digital World\\nThis is where a project called Aleph cloud is making some serious waves. They\\'re stepping up to build that essential foundation for this next generation of applications, especially the decentralized AI ones.\\nStarting as Aleph.im, Growing into a Full Cloud Powerhouse\\nThe story started with Aleph.im, which was a pioneering open-source network for decentralized storage and computing. But as the digital world evolved, they saw the bigger need and made a strategic move, rebranding to Aleph cloud. This wasn\\'t just a name change; it was about becoming a \"full cloud platform,\" offering a complete, user-friendly suite of decentralized services that can actually compete with the big centralized players, but with all those decentralized advantages.\\nThink of what Aleph cloud is at its core: a \"decentralized cloud computing platform,\" described as a \"chain-agnostic, GDPR compliant supercloud.\" Their mission is pretty clear: make scalable, interoperable, and censorship-resistant services for decentralized apps (dApps) and, yes, AI solutions. Imagine an alternative to AWS, but built not on their private data centers, but on a global network of nodes run by lots of different people and organizations. That\\'s Aleph cloud – inherently more resilient, private, and open.\\nBeing \"chain-agnostic\" is key here. It means they don\\'t just work with one type of blockchain; they can connect with many, like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Super important in our diverse Web3 world!\\nMaking it Real: TwentySix Cloud – Your Easy Button for Decentralization\\nTo make all this powerful decentralized stuff something you can actually use easily, Aleph.im (before becoming Aleph cloud) launched TwentySix Cloud in early 2024. Seriously, think of it like AWS for the Web3 era, but without a central overlord. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes deploying and managing applications on Aleph\\'s distributed network way simpler.\\nWith TwentySix Cloud, developers get the tools to:\\n-\\nLaunch websites and apps that are built to last pretty much forever (no single company can just pull the plug!).\\n-\\nUse those virtual machines we talked about, easily paying as they go with $ALEPH tokens.\\n-\\nStore files in a way that\\'s spread out across the network – if one computer hits a snag, your data is still safe.\\n-\\nRun AI models for all sorts of things like smart contracts or automated bots.\\nPicture this: a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) app. It could run all its logic and store all its crucial data right there on TwentySix Cloud. Everything stays transparent and totally resistant to censorship. This focus on being user-friendly is huge for getting more people to actually build on decentralized tech.\\nHow Does It All Work? A Quick Look Under the Hood\\nSo, how does this decentralized magic happen? Aleph cloud uses two main types of helper computers, or nodes:\\n-\\nCore Channel Nodes (CCNs): These are the super-organized project managers. They\\'re the main entry points, handling requests (\"messages\"), making sure everything is legitimate, and coordinating the network.\\n-\\nCompute Resource Nodes (CRNs): These are the actual workhorses. They provide the computing power and storage – running the programs, doing the AI calculations, and storing your files.\\nWhen you want the network to do something, you send a \"message.\" A CCN picks it up, checks it, and then hands the task off to a CRN. It\\'s all built on economic incentives – folks who run these nodes (\"node operators\") stake ALEPH tokens as a kind of security deposit and earn more tokens as rewards for keeping the network healthy and providing resources. Pretty smart system, right?\\nWhat Cool Stuff Can Aleph Cloud Actually DO (Especially for AI)?\\nAleph cloud offers some seriously powerful tools:\\n-\\nDecentralized Storage: It\\'s a \"fully decentralised storage solution\" that combines IPFS (great for permanent, verifiable data) with mutable databases (needed for data that changes, like user profiles). Your data is encrypted and spread out, making it way safer. Perfect for keeping sensitive AI training data secure.\\n-\\nCompute on Demand: You get different types of Virtual Machines (VMs), like having your own private computer running on the network.\\n-\\nConfidential VMs*:* Okay, THIS is where it gets really cool for AI! Using special hardware encryption (like AMD SEV), these VMs let you run computations on sensitive data without anyone – not even the person running the node – being able to see the data or the process. Imagine training AI on sensitive healthcare or financial data in complete privacy! This is a game-changer.\\n-\\nServerless Functions: Run small pieces of code easily without managing servers.\\n-\\n-\\nSerious Muscle for AI: GPU Support! AI needs intense computing power, especially from GPUs. Aleph cloud provides access to \"decentralized GPUs for high-performance computing,\" essential for training big models. They\\'re even planning a \"GPU marketplace\" to make accessing this power easier. Putting decentralized GPUs together with Confidential VMs? That\\'s a uniquely powerful combo for privacy-preserving AI.\\n-\\nThe ALEPH Token: This is the fuel that powers everything. You use it to pay for services (they have a user-friendly Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model!). Node operators stake it to show commitment and earn it as rewards for their work. It keeps the whole ecosystem running smoothly.\\nWhy Go with Aleph Cloud? The Real Perks of Choosing Decentralized\\nPicking a decentralized platform like Aleph cloud isn\\'t just about being on the cutting edge; it brings some serious, practical benefits:\\n- Your Data is YOUR Data: It\\'s built for enhanced privacy and security. They even state they\\'re \"fully GDPR compliant, as neither we nor the node operators have access to the data stored in the cloud.\" Big difference from some traditional clouds!\\n- Rock Solid Reliability: Because it\\'s spread out, there\\'s no single point of failure. Much harder for things to go down.\\n- Censorship? Not So Easy: It\\'s much harder for anyone to shut down or censor applications running on a decentralized network. Freedom to build and share!\\n- Potentially Lighter on the Wallet: By using a global network of resources, they can often offer competitive pricing with that clear PAYG model.\\n- Opening Doors for Everyone: It lowers the barrier for smaller teams, startups, and individuals to access powerful computing resources, reducing reliance on Big Tech and even creating ways for people worldwide to earn by running nodes. That\\'s democratizing access!\\n- Plays Nice with Others: Being chain-agnostic means it works smoothly with lots of different blockchain networks.\\nAleph Cloud in Action: Who\\'s Using It?\\nThis isn\\'t just theoretical stuff; it\\'s being used in the real world:\\n- Gaming Giant Ubisoft: Yes, the big one! They\\'ve been using Aleph cloud (starting back in the Aleph.im days) to manage the dynamic data for NFTs in games like Champions Tactics. And get this – Ubisoft is so invested, they actually run one of the network nodes themselves!\\n- Powering AI Agents & DeAI: It\\'s an ideal home for those autonomous AI agents that need reliable, secure computing. They actively support projects like LibertAI, focused on secure, open-source AI model hosting.\\n- Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Its reliability and data indexing tools are perfect for DeFi apps that need quick access to blockchain data.\\n- Secure Digital ID: They\\'re working with companies like Synaps and Anima on building systems for secure, self-sovereign identity – letting you control your digital credentials.\\nLooking Ahead: What\\'s Next for Aleph Cloud?\\nThe team isn\\'t sitting still. They\\'ve got exciting plans cooking:\\n- That Public GPU Marketplace is coming, making serious AI computing power even more accessible.\\n- Developing their own \"Oracle Services\" to securely feed real-world data to blockchains.\\n- Adding GeoLocalisation for Nodes so you can choose where your data is stored/processed for compliance or speed.\\n- They\\'ve got a $1 Million Web3 Accelerator Program specifically designed to help startups move away from centralized clouds, offering credits, storage, and guidance. It\\'s a strategic way to build a decentralized ecosystem!\\nWrapping It Up: Weaving a Brighter, More Trustworthy AI Future?\\nWhen we bring AI and blockchain together, we’re not just mashing up cool tech. We’re getting the best of both: AI’s incredible brainpower with blockchain’s unwavering honesty.\\nThis isn\\'t just about a fancy tech upgrade. It’s about making sure the powerful systems shaping our lives are also systems we can fundamentally trust. The time to build AI that\\'s not just smart, but also ethical and transparent, is right now.\\nLet’s responsibly build an AI future we can all believe in.'}\n",

The authors have provided key discussion points to Digital Journal.\\nThe panel cautioned against relying only on the safety measures built into the AI tools in order to avoid scams and explained ways to be vigilant and protect data, including the potential use of blockchain.\\nDan Dunlap: Educating the public about fraud detection\\nAccording Dunlap: “Scams using AI are certainly newer and more widespread, and the increasing scale and scope are immense and scary, but there is nothing fundamentally new or different about exploiting available technologies and vulnerabilities for committing fraud. These tools are more accessible, easier to use, higher quality, and faster, but not really fundamentally different from previous tools used for forgery and fraud”.\\nHe adds: “There is a constant need to educate the public and update detection and policy as criminals use the available tools,” he said. “Computer science professionals have a moral obligation to help in both educating the public and developing tools that help identify and protect all sectors.”\\n“Unfortunately, disseminating knowledge can also help to exploit the weaknesses of the technology,” Dunlap concludes. “Powerful, available, and accessible tools are destined to be co-opted for both positive and negative ends.”\\nJulia Feerrar: Watching for telltale signs of scams\\n“We have some new things to look out for when it comes to AI-fuelled scams and misinformation. ChatGPT 4o’s image generator is really effective at creating not just convincing illustrations and photo-realistic images, but documents with text as well,” Feerrar indicates. “We can’t simply rely on the visual red flags of the earliest image generators.”\\n“I encourage people to slow down for a few extra seconds, especially when we’re unsure of the original source,” she said. “Then look for more context using your search engine of choice.”\\nFeerrar follows this with: “Generative AI tools raise complex questions about copyright and intellectual property, as well as data privacy. If you upload your images to be transformed with an AI tool, be aware that the tool’s company may now claim ownership, including to further train the AI model.”\\n“For receipts or documents, check the math, the address — basic errors can be telling. Large language models struggle with basic math. However, know that a committed scammer can likely fix these kinds of issues pretty easily. You should also be asking how this image got to you. Is it from a trusted, reputable source?” she adds.\\nFeerrar concludes, noting: “Basic digital security and anti-phishing advice applies whether a scammer uses generative AI or not. Now is also a great time to set up 2-factor authentication,” she added. “This kind of decision-making is a key part of what digital literacy and AI literacy mean today.”\\nMurat Kantarcioglu: Using blockchain to prove files are unaltered\\n“It’s very hard for end users to distinguish between what’s real versus what’s fake,” Kantarcioglu states. “We shouldn’t really trust AI to do the right thing. There are enough publicly available models that people can download and modify to bypass guardrails.”\\n“Blockchain can be used as a tamper-evident digital ledger to track data and enable secure data sharing. In an era of increasingly convincing AI-generated content, maintaining a blockchain-based record of digital information provenance could be essential for ensuring verifiability and transparency on a global scale,” Kantarcioglu continues.\\nHe also offered a simple but powerful low-tech solution, noting: “A family could establish a secret password as a means of authentication. For instance, in my case, if someone were to claim that I had been kidnapped, my family would use this password to verify my identity and confirm the situation.”'}\n",
      "async_langchain: 91, {'article': 'Page title: Why do LLMs have emergent properties?\\nSocial card title: Why do LLMs have emergent properties?\\nSocial card description: Large language models show unexpected \"emergent\" behaviors as they are scaled up. This should not at all be surprising. Here we give a possible explanation.\\nLarge language models display emergence behaviors: when the parameter count is scaled to a certain value, suddenly the LLM is capable of performing a new task not possible at a smaller size. Some say the abruptness of this change is merely a spurious artifact of how it is measured. Even so, many would like to understand, predict, and even facilitate the emergence of these capabilities.\\nThe following is not a mathematical proof , but a plausibility argument as to why such behavior should not be surprising, and a possible mechanism. I’ll start with simple cases and work up to more complex ones.\\nIn nature\\nAn obvious point. Emergence is ubiquitous in nature. Ice near the freezing point that is slightly heated suddenly becomes drinkable (phase change). An undrivable car with three wheels gets a fourth wheel and is suddenly drivable. Nonlinearity exists in nature.\\nIn machine learning\\nA simple example: consider fitting N arbitrary points in one dimension with linear regression using monomials. For a basis up to degree less than N-1, for most possible sets of data points (excluding “special” cases like collinear), the regression error will be non-zero, and reciprocally, the accuracy will be some finite value. Increase the number of monomials (parameter count) to N-1, and suddenly the error drops to zero, and accuracy jumps to infinity.\\nWhen using k-means clustering, if one has n clusters and runs k-means clustering with K<N cluster centers, the error will be significant, but when K=N, suddenly the cluster centers can model all clusters well, and the error drops dramatically.\\nIn algorithms\\nConsider all Boolean circuits composed from some fixed logically complete set of gate types. Now consider the goal of constructing a Boolean circuit that takes a single byte representing the integer N and increments it to N+1, modulo 256 (8 bits input, 8 bits output). Clearly, such a circuit exists, for example, the standard chain of 1-bit add-and-carry circuits. Note one can in principle enumerate all possible circuits of finite gate count. It is manifest that an integer K>0 exists for which no circuit with less than K gates solves the problem but there exists a circuit with K gates that does. The standard chain of 8 1-bit adders might be such a minimizer, or maybe the optimal circuit is more exotic (for example see here, though this method is not guaranteed to compute a minimizer).\\nOne would thus see this capability potentially emerge as soon as one reaches a gate budget of K gates. Now, one could argue that for a smaller gate budget, a partial result might be possible, for example, incrementing any 7-bit number—so the increase in capability is continuous, not emergent or wholly new. However, if all you care about is correctly incrementing any byte (for example, for manipulating ASCII text), then it’s all or nothing; there’s no partial credit. Even so, the gate budget required for for incrementing 8 bits compared to only 7-bit integers is only slightly higher, but this minor increase in gate count actually doubles the quantity of integers that can be incremented, which might be perceived as a surprising, unexpected (emergent) jump.\\nIn LLMs\\nThe parameter count of an LLM defines a certain bit budget. This bit budget must be spread across many, many tasks the final LLM will be capable of, as defined by the architecture and the training process (in particular, the specific mix of training data). These tasks are implemented as “algorithms” (circuits) within the LLM. The algorithms are mixed together and (to some extent) overlap in a complex way that is difficult to analyze.\\nSuppose one of these desired capabilities is some task X. Suppose all possible input/output pairs for this operation are represented in the training data (or, maybe not—maybe some parts of the algorithm can be interpolated from the training data). The LLM is trained with SGD, typically with 2-norm minimization. The unit ball in the 2-norm is a sphere in high dimensional space. Thus “all directions” of the loss are pressed down equally by the minimization process—which is to say, the LLM is optimized on all the inputs for many, many tasks, not just task X. The limited parameter bit budget must be spread across many, many other tasks the LLM must be trained to do. As LLMs of increasing size are trained, at some point enough parameter bits in the budget will be allocatable to represent a fully accurate algorithm for task X, and at this point the substantially accurate capability to do “task X” will be perceivable—“suddenly.”\\nTask X could be the 8-bit incrementer, which from an optimal circuit standpoint would manifest emergence, as described above. However, due to the weakness of the SGD training methodology and possibly the architecture, there is evidence that LLM training does not learn optimal arithmetic circuits at all but instead does arithmetic by a “bag of heuristics” (which incidentally really is, itself, an algorithm, albeit a piecemeal one). In this case, gradually adding more and more heuristics might be perceived to increase the number of correct answers in a somewhat more incremental way, to be sure. However, this approach is not scalable—to perform accurate arithmetic for any number of digits, if one does not use an exact arithmetic algorithm or circuit, one must use increasingly more heuristics to increase coverage to try to capture all possible inputs accurately. And still, transitioning from an approximate to an exact 8-bit incrementer might in practice be perceived as an abrupt new capability, albeit a small one for this example.\\nOne could alternatively consider tool use (for example, a calculator function that is external to the LLM proper), but then a new tool must be written for every new task, and the LLM needs to understand how to use the tool. (Maybe at some point LLMs will know how to write and use their own algorithmic tools?)\\nPredicting emergence\\nThe real question is how can we predict when a new LLM will achieve some new capability X. For example, X = “Write a short story that resonates with the social mood of the present time and is a runaway hit” (and do the same thing again once a year based on new data, indefinitely into the future without failure). We don’t know an “algorithm” for this, and we can’t even begin to guess the required parameter budget or the training data needed. That’s the point of using an LLM—its training internally “discovers” new, never seen before algorithms from data that would be difficult for humans to formulate or express from first principles. Perhaps there is some indirect way of predicting the emergence of such X, but it doesn’t seem obvious on the face of it how to predict this directly.\\nConclusion\\nBased on these examples, it would seem not at all surprising for LLMs to exhibit emergent behaviors, though in our experience our encounter with them may be startling. Predicting them may be possible to a limited extent but for the general case seems really hard.\\nDo you have any thoughts? If so, please leave them in the comments.\\nI would not speak of algorithms, since there is always some probabilistic data thrown in the calculation, but I generally agree with you.\\nAs for emergence, I think it is the result of a very large event space. With billions of parameters, it is not only possible but very probable that sooner or later the system takes a new route, which leads to a result that we call emergent.'}\n",

Natural disasters like wildfires are next.\\nFires in the Los Angeles area have claimed more than 16,000 homes and other structures so far this year. Damages in January were estimated as high as $164 billion, making it potentially the worst natural disaster financially in U.S. history, according to Bloomberg.\\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service have reportedly been redirecting resources in recent months toward beneficial fires to reduce overgrowth.\\nAI enables fire departments to keep more eyes on controlled burns, making them safer and more accepted in communities, say industry experts.\\n“This is just like cancer treatment,” said Sonia Kastner, CEO and founder of Pano AI, based in San Francisco. “You can do early screening, catch it when it’s in phase one, and hit it with really aggressive treatment so it doesn’t progress — what we’ve seen this fire season is proof that our customers across the country use our solution in this way.”\\nSan Ramon, California-based Green Grid, which specializes in AI for utility companies, in September alerted its customer at a Big Bear resort that a fire started in the San Bernardino National Forest was near, said Chinmoy Saha, the company’s CEO. By acting early, the resort customer was able to prepare for the needed suppression measures for the fire before it reached and became uncontrollable, he said. Due to the favorable weather conditions, the fire did not reach the customer territory.\\nIn the recent Los Angeles area fires, Saha said he had been in discussion with a customer seeking to bring AI to cameras located at the site of the now-devasted Eaton fire that has claimed 17 lives and more than 9,000 buildings.\\n“If we had our system there, this fire could have been mitigated,” said Saha. “Early detection is the key, so the fire is contained and it doesn’t become a catastrophic wildfire.”\\nAiding First Responders With Accelerated Computing\\nPano’s service provides human-in-the-loop AI-driven fire detection and alerts that have enabled fire departments to act faster than from 911 calls, accelerating containment efforts, said Kastner.\\nThe company’s Pano Station uses two ultra-high-definition cameras mounted on top of mountains like a cell tower, rotating 360 degrees every minute to capture views 10 miles in all directions. Those images are transmitted to the cloud every minute, where AI models running on GPUs do inference for smoke detection.\\nPano has a daytime smoke detection model and a nighttime near infrared model looking for smoke, as well as a nighttime geostationary satellite model. It has a human in the loop for verifying the detections, and it can be confirmed using digital zoom and time-lapse imagery.\\nIt trains on NVIDIA GPUs locally and runs inference on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.\\nHarnessing AI for Controlled Burns\\nCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is carrying out prescribed fires, or controlled burns, to reduce dry vegetation that creates fuel for wildfires.\\n“Controlled burns are necessary, and we didn’t do a good job in California for the past 30 or 40 years,” said Saha. Green Grid has deployed its trailer mounted AI camera sensors for monitoring fires and control burns before they go out of control.\\nPano can be used by fire departments to monitor controlled burn zones with its AI-driven cameras to make sure that plumes of smoke don’t appear outside of the permitted zone, maintaining safety.\\nThe company has its cameras stationed at Rancho Palos Verdes, south of the recent Los Angeles area fires.\\n“The area around the palisades fire was a very overgrown forest, and with a lot of dead fuels, so our hope is that there is going to be more focus on prescribed fires,” said Kastner.\\nEmbracing AI at Fire Departments for Faster Mitigation\\nCAL FIRE is partnered with Alert California and UC San Diego for a network of cameras owned by investor-owned utilities, CAL FIRE, U.S. Forest Service and other U.S. Department of the Interior agencies.\\nThrough that network, they’ve implemented an AI program that looks for new fire starts. It pans every two minutes and continuously updates, and Alert California has the most up-to-date information from this network.\\nIf AI can enable fire departments to get to the scene of a fire when it’s just a few acres, it’s a lot easier to control than if it’s 50 or more acres, said David Acuna, battalion chief at CAL FIRE, Clovis, California.

New research says it could\\nSocial card description: Australian employers are using artificial intelligence hiring systems for recruitment, but new research suggests the technology may \"enable discrimination\" against marginalised groups.\\nAI job recruitment tools could \\'enable discrimination\\' against marginalised groups, research finds\\nAustralian employers are increasingly using artificial intelligence hiring systems to screen and shortlist job candidates, but new research has found the technology creates serious risks of discrimination.\\nAI systems promise to save employers time and money in the recruitment process by using cutting-edge technology, such as CV scanners and vocal assessments, to \"classify, rank and score\" job applicants.\\nThis means a computer program could be assessing a jobseeker\\'s application right now, and accepting or rejecting it based on its machine understanding before the person reaches an interview stage with a human.\\nYet new research from Dr Natalie Sheard, a lawyer and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Melbourne, has found AI hiring systems may \"enable, reinforce and amplify discrimination against historically marginalised groups\".\\n\"There are some serious risks that are created by the way in which these systems are used by employers, so risks for already disadvantaged groups in the labour market — women, jobseekers with disability or [from] non-English-speaking backgrounds, older candidates,\" she tells ABC Radio National\\'s Law Report.\\nAbout 62 per cent of Australian organisations used AI \"extensively or moderately\" as part of their recruitment processes last year, according to the Responsible AI Index.\\nYet Australia does not currently have any specific laws to regulate how these tools operate or how organisations may use them. It was hoped AI would end bias in the hiring process but several well-publicised cases in America have highlighted that the opposite is occurring.\\nIn one example, an AI system developed by Amazon learned to downgrade the applications of jobseekers who used the word \"women\\'s\" in their CVs.\\nThe AI tools used in hiring\\nDr Sheard interviewed 23 people as part of her research into AI hiring systems. The participants were mainly recruiters who had worked at small, medium and/or large organisations, both private and public, and in a range of industries.\\nShe also spoke to two careers coaches to understand the impact of AI hiring practices on job candidates, as well as a leading Australian AI expert, and two employees of a large AI developer — the director of AI Services and the AI ethics leader.\\nHer focus was on three aspects of recruitment screening: CVs, candidate assessments (which may include psychological or psychometric tests) and video (\"robo\") interviews.\\nRobo interviews typically involve candidates recording themselves providing answers to a series of questions, which are then assessed by AI. Dr Sheard says there are well-known cases of AI tools initially using \"a controversial technique called facial analysis\" when analysing these interviews.\\n\"It had a look at the facial features and movements of applicants to assess their behaviour, personality. [For example], it was looking to see [if] they [were] enthusiastic or angry when they spoke to customers.\"\\nIn 2019, America\\'s Electronic Privacy Information Center filed a complaint against third-party recruitment agency HireVue over software it used to analyse video interviews with applicants, arguing the results were \"biased, unprovable and not replicable\".\\nFacial analysis has been scientifically discredited. But Dr Sheard warns there is no law in place to prohibit its use and so \"some systems may be still incorporating\" it.\\nHow do AI hiring systems impact marginalised candidates?\\nAI hiring tools can experience data bias, Dr Sheard says, since the systems learn from the information they are fed.\\nSome AI hiring systems are built using large language models, for example, and if they are missing datasets from a disadvantaged group, \"they won\\'t be representative\" of the broader population, the academic says.\\nThis is similarly the case if there are biases in the AI system\\'s training data, which means it adopts and reproduces the same biases and discriminatory practices as the tools used in its development.\\n\"They\\'re trained on things that are scraped from the internet. For example, we know … only about 15 per cent of women contribute to articles on Wikipedia. So it incorporates that male view, which can then be brought through into recruitment processes.\"\\nOne example of learned gender discrimination occurred at Amazon when it developed an AI hiring model in 2014 based on CVs collected from applicants for software developer positions over a 10-year period.\\n\"That model learnt to systemically discriminate against women because it\\'s a male-dominated field. [Many of] those CVs came from men, and so the system learnt to downgrade the applications of women who applied for positions through that tool, particularly when they use the word \"women\\'s\" in their application. For example, [if] they [wrote they] attended a women\\'s college,\" Dr Sheard says.\\n\"And it also picked up language styles that are used by men, so when particular words were used more typically by men … like executed or actioned, it upgraded those applications.\"\\nThe recruitment tool was reportedly found to be sexist and ultimately scrapped.\\nAI tools under the microscope in the US\\nIn America, several complaints allege AI tools have discriminated against job applicants from different backgrounds.\\nIn one case, it was claimed the hiring software used by HireVue in the recruitment process resulted in systemic discrimination and violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\\nThe complaint claims DK, who is Indigenous and is a Deaf woman who speaks with a deaf accent, had been working for her employer for more than five years and was encouraged by her supervisor to apply for a seasonal manager position at her company.\\nShe had the experience and qualifications needed for a promotion, but she said she was rejected for the role after completing an automated video interview and assessment with HireVue.\\nHireVue uses automated speech recognition systems to generate transcripts based on the audio of the interview and it is alleged that these systems perform worse for non-white people and also deaf or hard of hearing speakers.\\n\"The way that these systems [assess your communication skills] is by assessing how well you speak standard English … [so] if you speak English as a second language and use non-standard English when you speak, then you\\'re likely to be assessed as not having good communication skills by these systems,\" Dr Sheard says.\\nAfter DK was informed she did not get the promotion, she received an email with feedback about how to improve on the HireVue assessment, including a direction to \"practice active listening\".\\n\"That makes you question what kind of human oversight was provided for this whole process? Because at some point a human should have intervened and said, \\'Well, this is just at odds with what we know about this person,\\'\" Dr Sheard says.\\nIn a separate case, a tutoring group that was recruiting in the US was found to have programmed a hiring system to automatically reject female applicants over 55 years of age and male applicants over 60 years of age, which resulted in the rejection of 200 qualified candidates.\\nThe employer was taken to court by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner, an action that resulted in a $US365,000 settlement.\\nAnother complaint raised by the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU) against a provider of AI hiring systems that design, sell, and administer online assessments to employers alleges that the assessments discriminate on the basis of disability and/or race.\\nOne of the ACLU\\'s complaints is that an algorithmically driven adaptive employee personality test adversely impacts \"autistic people, otherwise neurodivergent people, and people with mental health disabilities such as depression and anxiety\".\\nThe foundation says this is because it tests for characteristics that are \"close proxies of their disabilities\" and which are \"likely not necessary for essential job functions for most positions\". It adds that the scores of those applicants with disabilities are likely to be significantly impacted by those characteristics.\\n\"If you\\'re a jobseeker who experiences depression, you\\'re probably not going to score highly on positivity, so that is really going to be a proxy for a disability that you might have and may filter you out of the process when you might be able to perform all of the essential requirements of the role,\" Dr Sheard says.\\nWhat about AI hiring tools in Australia?\\nSimilar legal action has not yet taken place in Australia but the Merit Protection Commissioner, which reviews employment decisions such as job progression, has offered guidance for employers in the public sector using AI hiring systems.\\nIt came after its commissioner overturned 11 promotion decisions made by government agency Services Australia in a single recruitment round during the 2021-22 financial year.\\nApplicants were required to pass through a sequence of AI assessments, including psychometric testing, questionnaires and self-recorded video responses. No human was involved in the process or review, and the commissioner found the system led to meritorious applicants missing out on promotions.\\nThe Merit Protection Commissioner has since warned that not all AI recruitment tools on the market have been thoroughly tested, nor are they guaranteed to be completely unbiased.\\n\"I think there\\'s absolutely a need to regulate these AI screening systems,\" Dr Sheard says.\\n\"Some groups have called for a complete ban on these systems, and I think there is a lot of merit to that argument, particularly while we\\'re in a situation where we don\\'t have proper legal safeguards in place, and where we don\\'t really understand the impacts of these systems on already marginalised groups in the labour market.\"\\nWhile employers may argue these AI hiring systems create a more efficient recruitment process, Dr Sheard says this argument needs to be balanced with \"the risks of harming marginalised groups\".\\nIn February, the House Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training released a report on the Future of Work that recommended a ban on the use of AI systems for final decision-making in HR without any human oversight.\\nThe Australian government has also been looking at the regulation of AI technologies, including whether Australia should introduce an AI Act similar to that in place in the European Union.\\n\"The government proposed that there should be some mandatory, what they call, guardrails for high-risk applications of AI. And high-risk applications are generally considered to include these AI screening systems,\" Dr Sheard says.\\n\"That process hasn\\'t concluded and is somewhat up in the air with the election … [so] there\\'s no time frame for that.\"\\nIn the meantime, Dr Sheard believes the Australian government needs to review its anti-discrimination laws to make sure they are still \"fit for purpose\" and cover \"these new technologies, particularly around liability\".\\nWant to go beyond the news cycle?\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.'}\n",

I was scooped! Somewhat. I added an addendum section discussing this paper at the bottom.\\nIntroduction\\nThere has been a fair bit of discussion over this recent ‘creating binders against snake venom protein’ paper from the Baker Lab that came out earlier this year, including this article from Derek Lowe.\\nFor a quick recap of the paper: the authors use RFDiffusion (a computational tool for generating proteins from scratch) to design proteins that bind to neurotoxic protein found in snake venom, preventing it from interacting with the body. They offer structural characterization results to show binding between their created protein binder and the protein in question (three-finger toxins), and in-vivo results in mice demonstrating that their created protein confers protection against the designed protein as proof.\\nIt’s excellent work, and potentially one of the first times that RFDiffusion has been used in such a straightforward way for a clearly useful problem (though others disagree with me on this being the first time). But, there’s a few obvious questions here: why computationally design binders against venoms if we already have antivenoms available on the market? What further work remains to be done to create binders against any arbitrary venom? And when can we expect that?\\nI asked these questions, fell down a surprisingly rabbit hole, and decided to compile the results together to release as an article. This is the result.\\nLet’s get started!\\nThe dismal state of antivenom production\\nVaccines are the prototypical ‘clearly good for humanity, but terrible profit incentives’ drug. You spend billions on R&D and clinical trials, give someone a shot once, and then they’ll never need the drug again (or need it once every decade). As such, you end up with these insane cases of promising vaccines being left by the wayside for decades due to economic reasons (see the malaria vaccine debacle), with millions of lives being lost in the process.\\nIn many ways, antivenom production mirrors the problem of vaccines, but on a smaller scale.\\nBut you needn’t take my word for it! As it happens, the Works in Progress magazine has already published a lengthy essay on how horrifically bad the state of antivenom manufacturing is. As such, instead of taxing my own brain, I will rely on quotes from their very well written piece to cover the main points.\\nOn how many people are affected by snake bites:\\nVenomous snakebites kill between 81,000 and 138,000 people each year, and leave another 400,000 with permanent disabilities. This ranks it among the deadliest of neglected tropical diseases, alongside better-known ailments such as typhus and cholera.\\nOn the cost of antivenoms:\\nThe average cost of antivenom alone in sub-Saharan Africa was $124 in 2010, a steep price to pay for the 40 percent of sub-Saharan Africans who live on less than $1.90 per day. And that doesn’t even include the cost of the care or facilities. A survey of 129 Bangladeshi snakebite victims found that over 40 percent had to take out loans to meet the costs.\\nOn the state of the antivenom shortage:\\nNeed for antivenom is increasing each year, yet the supply of quality antivenom fails to keep up. A 2011 study found six companies producing antivenom sold in sub-Saharan Africa. These companies produced 410,500 ampoules of antivenom, just enough to treat 96,000 cases. That’s only one third of the total estimated cases on the continent….The global antivenom market in 2016 was valued at $1.1 billion and was projected to reach $1.5 billion by 2021. It instead fell to $1.02 Billion.\\nWhy there is a shortage at all:\\nThe mess of poorly tested, mislabeled, and at times outright fraudulent products has resulted in the current predicament: a market for lemons. Confidence in antivenom treatment has fallen…..Even if antivenom production at high throughputs and low prices would be profitable over a longer time horizon, producers have been unwilling to make the large up-front investments necessary to achieve that scale, in no small part due to uncertainty over whether governments and clinics would follow through on promises to buy at those prices. Governments and clinics, on the other hand, have become wary of making large purchase orders after being burned one too many times on promises of cheap antivenom.\\nSo, with the thesis of why we’d want better antivenom cleared out, we can continue. Before we start discussing how antivenom may be improved, we should first understand venom.\\nA primer on snake venom heterogeneity\\nKeep in mind, snake venom is not just one thing, but rather an umbrella term for a cocktail of proteins (and small molecules, though these are less important). The therapeutic issue here is that the composition of the toxin can vary at four increasing levels of taxonomic specificity:\\nBetween snake families (obvious)\\nBetween snake species (obvious)\\nBetween snakes of the same species (less obvious)\\nWithin the same snake over time (perplexing)\\nLet’s go in order.\\nAt the familial level, venom composition heterogeneity is the strongest. There are around twenty snake families in total, but only four are known to be venomous: Viperidae (vipers), Elapidae (elapids), Atractaspididae, and Colubridae. Of these, the latter two are typically left out in discussions of snake bites, as they are either quite shy, have relatively innocuous venom, or physically are unable to bite humans due to the location of their fangs (e.g. rear-fanged snakes). Because of this, we’ll focus on vipers and elapids. These two possess the strongest differences in venom composition.\\nElapids venoms contain three-finger toxins (3FTxs, which is the one discussed in the Baker Lab paper), Phospholipase A2 enzymes (PLA2), and Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors. These toxins are primarily neurotoxic.\\nViper venoms are predominantly composed of enzymatic proteins such as snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), snake venom serine proteases (SVSPs), and L-amino acid oxidases (LAAOs). These enzymes primarily cause tissue destruction, hemorrhage, and coagulopathy.\\nSo, obviously, entirely different classes of proteins, thus entirely different needed therapeutics. Simple, let’s keep two types of antivenom, one for each family.\\nBut, while the broader strokes of proteins are different between snake families, there continue to be major deviations amongst species of the same family; the primary example being toxin compositions that are entirely unique to singular species. Naja nigricollis (Black-necked spitting cobra) venom uniquely contains cytotoxins in addition to neurotoxins, though, admittedly, the cytotoxins themselves aren’t especially dangerous unless injected near the eyes. On a more fatal note, Dendroaspis polylepis (Black mamba) venom has an especially high concentration of dendrotoxins, which are neurotoxic enough to cause death in an hour after a bite. But there also exist cases of extraordinary compositional heterogeneity amongst snake species venoms; no unique proteins, but unique clinical impacts. The prototypical case here is Daboia russelii (Russell’s viper), which uniquely produces a highly procoagulant venom despite lacking wholly unique proteins, leading to paradoxical blood clotting, kidney failure, and eventually death.\\nOkay. Two antivenoms for every snake bite was a pipe dream, perhaps we’ll need to scale things up. Perhaps an antivenom for every venomous snake species? There’s only 600~ of them. That’s not so bad.\\nBut, once again, there’s another level of heterogeneity. Snake venom composition can vary not only amongst species, but within a species too. Famously, the Crotalus scutulatus (Mojave rattlesnake) has populations that produce completely different types of venom. Some populations produce venom with presynaptic neurotoxins (type A), while others lack it entirely and instead produce venom rich in hemorrhagic metalloproteinases and serine proteinases (type B), — both of which require completely different antivenoms. And, sometimes, there are snakes that possess both types of these venoms. Most worrying of all is that the geographic variation of all of these venom types is decently intermixed; sometimes separated by cities but sometimes separated by only a few miles. A nearly identical phenomenon is noted in Crotalus horridus (Timber rattlesnake).\\nOkay. Okay okay okay. We\\'ll need different antivenoms for different populations of the same species. This does appear to be an edge case…so maybe it doesn’t bump up the number of antivenoms we need to keep in stock much. Is that it?\\nOne last bit. Even species + region specificity isn\\'t enough, because venom composition can vary within a single snake over its lifetime.\\nA dramatic example of this is in the family Pseudonaj (Australian brown snakes), which have non-coagulopathic venom as juveniles, but switch to coagulopathic venom as adults. Other than for one specific species, which continue to have non-coagulopathic venom as adults! Why does this occur? Often referred to as venom ontogenetic shift, it is likely driven diet-based selection pressures. And these venom shifts aren’t sudden snap changes in proteomic venom composition of their venom as they age, but rather a gradual shift over time. Because of this, there will be no ‘young snake’ antivenom and ‘old snake’ antivenom, since it’s all a spectrum.\\nLuckily, that’s the last layer of venom complexity.\\nGiven all this, one may start to view venom as an almost...cancer-y phenomenon. It\\'s all so heterogeneous, in the sense that what works for one case may be completely ineffective for another, even when they appear superficially similar. Even the theoretical framework for why such venom differences even exist is fuzzy. Like, we can point to diet-based selection pressures for ontogenetic shifts, but even that doesn\\'t fully explain the geographic variation we see in species like the Mojave rattlesnake we mentioned earlier.\\nBut unlike cancer we, at least theoretically, have a real solution for it: anti-venom. Antivenom that, admittedly, must account for the venom heterogeneity specific to the snake type, species, region, and age of the snake. But a solution nonetheless. Speaking of, that’s our next topic.\\nBut, before we move on, it’s worth noting that this section has primarily dealt with the proteomic composition of venom. What of the small molecules in them? There is unfortunately relatively little information on them. We know they exist, one review paper specifically says ‘salts, amino acids, hormones, nucleosides, neurotransmitters, and polyamines’ have been found in venoms. But it is, from literature review alone, unclear what exactly these do. Given that off-the-shelf antivenoms seem to largely ignore the existence of these, I’m assuming the small molecules are largely there to amplify or stabilize the proteomic elements of the venom. As such, I too will ignore them in the following section.\\nA primer on snake antivenom\\nAt a base level, antivenoms are relatively simple. As with nearly everything [bad] floating around in our body, the best way to deal with venoms is to simply prevent it from interacting it with anything. In the case of viruses, bacteria, and even cancer, one way the body goes about doing that is via antibodies (something I’ve written at length about). To create an antivenom involves doing the exact same thing. Simply produce en-masse antibodies that bind to the proteins that the snake bit you with, preventing it from interacting with anything else in your body, and you’re cured!\\nThis may raise an immediate question: is the antivenom produced by one snake only applicable to that exact species? How much of an issue is the venom heterogeneity problem we’ve spent so much time talking about?\\nWell...it’s complicated. In the absolute ideal case, if you want to ensure that no case of snake envenomation goes untreated, you need to have snakes species that matches every single possible venom composition (the count of which is understudied) and are willing to consistently produce venom (a notorious problem with some snakes, such as coral snakes). Due to this, most antivenoms have, almost by necessity, become hyperspecialized. One review paper has this insane statement: For example, India has more than 60 venomous species of snake, and there is no specific antivenom against most of them. If you are bitten by a snake that is not one of the ‘big four’ (spectacled cobra, common krait, saw-scaled viper and Russell’s viper), the antivenom will be largely ineffective.\\nSo how many venoms do we need to produce an effective antivenom against them? Well, while I did say there are 600 species of venomous snakes worldwide, only 200 produce venom that’d be dangerous to a human. But remember, we have the complexity of regional and ontogenetic differences to deal with. And, unfortunately, it is extremely unclear from the literature how many extra antivenoms that these two extra layers of complexity would demand.\\nBut perhaps we’re going down the wrong route entirely. Instead of trying to come up with a universal list of all possible venom compositions, we could perhaps reframe the problem. Instead of caring about the universe of venoms, we should care about the universe of proteins contained within all possible venoms.\\nClinically speaking, this means moving away from thinking about monovalent antivenoms — antivenoms derived from a single species — and instead relying on polyvalent antivenoms — multiple different antivenoms that have been combined together. This way, we needn’t need keep 200 or so different vials of antivenom together, but group them together into a few dozen combinations. If you’re bitten by a snake in Australia (and don’t die in the next 15 minutes), we needn’t try to identify the exact species that bit you and provide that specific antivenom.\\nInstead, you’ll simply be given the antivenom derived from all snakes that live in Australia. Or at least, at least some of the major snake species, with the assumption that there will be sufficient cross-neutralization (also called (paraspecific neutralization) for snake venom that we lack.\\nAnd, practically speaking, this is exactly what is done. At least in Australia, where there is a polyvalent antivenom licensed to treat envenomation by any of the major Australian snakes (taipans, brown snakes, tiger snakes, death adders, black snakes, many of whom share toxic proteins). Of course, there isn’t a free lunch here; polyvalent antivenoms must be administrated at relatively heavy doses, since they are diluted across multiple venom targets. This means more antibodies floating around, increasing the likelihood of immune reactions such as serum sickness or anaphylaxis. The more complex the mix, the greater the risk. Additionally, because you aren’t actually covering all snake species, neutralization efficiency for at least some snake species might be nonexistent.\\nBut let’s ignore the nuances here and assume a few sets of polyvalent venom are all we need, which dramatically simplifies the extreme levels of toxicity heterogeneity we just discussed.\\nHow exactly do we get those antibodies? Especially given the extreme heterogeneity we’ve seen in snake venom? Once again, I’ve been somewhat scooped here by another (very recent) Works in Progress essay, who has this to say about the traditional process of producing antivenoms:\\nIn the case of molecular complexity, consider antivenoms. The method to make antivenom has not changed much over the last 100 years. Venom is first milked from snakes and then injected into horses or sheep, which then produce multiple different antibodies and antibody fragments that bind to the venom….Blood is collected from these animals, the antibodies are purified from the plasma, and they are then given to people bitten by venomous snakes.\\nWhy horse and sheep for antibody production, and not E. coli or yeast or mammalian cells? Mostly size. Horses and sheep are big animals that can produce large volumes of blood (and thus antibodies) compared to microbial systems, which are often more expensive than they are worth given the terrible economics of antivenoms. Plus, their immune systems are reasonably similar to ours, which means the antibodies they produce are more likely to work in humans without causing severe immune reactions.\\nBut could we produce antivenoms through microbial systems? This would be a necessity if we wanted arbitrarily designed antibodies, instead of whatever an animal naturally produces in response to an injected venom. We’ll discuss this a bit more in the next section.\\nSure! Plenty of startups have spun up to do it. The basic pitch of it is to simply go through the usual horse/sheep production process, find the antibodies that are made in response to the venoms, and get an E. coli cell to produce the same thing via genetic engineering. And so we got companies like Venomyx, founded in 2015, and VenomAb, founded in 2016.\\nHow are they doing? Well…both are out of business. It is unclear why Venomyx shut down, but for VenomAb the reason for the shuttering was, as could be guessed, that delivering a return to investors would be nearly impossible. No technological infeasibility, just hard to make money off of.\\nAt this point, you should understand three things:\\nWhy there is an antivenom shortage\\nThe heterogeneity of venoms\\nThe associated heterogeneity + production difficulties of antivenoms\\nArmed with this context, we can finally answer the question: will protein design models help with the antivenom shortage problem?\\nDo computationally designed antivenoms actually solve anything?\\nIn the two articles discussing the original Baker lab paper, both touch on how this work alone doesn’t solve the problem of snake venom. Why?, you may ask, don’t the in-vivo results show that they do?. Well, importantly, the in-vivo results aren’t actually designed protein versus snake venom, it is designed protein versus three-finger toxin. Derek Lowe specifically says:\\nThese are still not going to snakebite cures by themselves, though, it has to be noted. There are other classes of nasty ingredients in snake venoms, with phospholipase enzymes near the top of the list.\\nBut, really, that’s a minor point. Honestly, we’re nearing a future of having binders-on-demand for any arbitrary target through computational methods. Some would say we are already there, so having to deal with a few extra enzymes shouldn’t be a big issue.\\nMoreover, for how much we’ve gabbed about venom heterogeneity, we’ve also discussed that it may very well be that the whole problem doesn’t matter, and cross-reactive/polyvalent antivenoms save the day. Australian antivenoms were one case of this, but it could be taken way, way further. Just in 2024, researchers screened fifty billion antibodies to find one that bound to all three-finger toxins found in elapids, many of which are structurally quite diverse. Will we be able to find similarly universal antibodies for the metalloproteinases in viper venom? For the phospholipases? And even if we do, can we get all of them to work together in a single cocktail that neutralizes all venom types without introducing new safety issues?\\nHonestly, probably. It feels like a decent bet that similar ‘universalities’ will be found across the toxin family — there is necessarily not a ton of evolutionary divergence amongst venoms.\\nIn time, methods like this may lead to a singular, extremely cross-reactive antivenom. One that contains only one, two, or a similarly small number of unique antibodies, but still manage to simultaneously neutralize the venoms of differing classes, species, regions, and ages of snake. No need to identify a snake to administer the correct antivenom anymore — if you manage to survive the trip to the hospital, there will be a cure waiting for you. We may very well live in the universe where these sorts of ‘holy grail’ antivenoms never actually comes to fruition, but I feel like theres decent enough reason to believe it is possible, so I will presume their existence for the rest of this essay.\\nSo, am I saying that computationally designed antivenoms will herald the end of the antivenom shortage? Well, let’s say we have this theoretical universal antivenom, granted to us by our protein design overlords. Or maybe through phage display. Or maybe phage display combined with protein design methods to further optimize them, whatever.\\nHere’s one pessimistic future: remember, antivenoms remain an awful market to work in, even independent of how hard they are to make. At least vaccines have the economic benefit of first-world children needing them, often supported by wealthy governments or global initiatives providing guaranteed demand and thus ensuring profitability. Antivenoms lack this advantage: they predominantly affect low-income populations in developing countries, regions with limited purchasing power, inconsistent healthcare infrastructure, and unpredictable demand. No wealthy parent or government is routinely lining up to buy antivenom ahead of time, leading to the economic catch-22 we\\'ve already outlined.\\nIt…doesn’t feel like this changes dramatically even if we have a perfect universal antivenom. The market does expand a bit, people may be more willing to trust and seek hospital treatments, and governments may have a clearer incentive to maintain consistent supplies. But fundamentally, one is still serving populations with very limited purchasing power and unpredictable demand. A perfect computationally-designed antivenom doesn’t guarantee market incentives. It simply makes a previously terrible market slightly less terrible.\\nIn this world, protein design models change little about the status quo. At best, the thermostable properties of our hallucinated antivenoms — a phenomenon seen in both the Baker lab paper and also a weirdly consistent characteristic of many AI-generated proteins — makes the cold supply chain less of a bottleneck. That’s not nothing! But it may not be enough.\\nYet…there’s also a more optimistic side, one that the first WiP essay we discussed alluded to. Quoting from there:\\nIf antivenom producers can be made confident that large investments will pay off, they are more than happy to make them. If governments are confident the antivenom they receive actually works, they are more inclined to buy it. When people start returning from the hospital healthy, happy, and with their wallets intact they are likely to go again and recommend their loved ones do too. In the Bangladeshian survey, most victims and their relatives expressed they would be willing to discontinue traditional healing practices if hospital treatments were easily available.\\nIf we’re to trust the Bangladeshian survey, universal antivenoms, stemming from protein design models, may be a panacea to the whole economic problem faced by antivenoms. Even if antivenoms are a bad market, a sufficiently good product may be enough to conquer the major issues.\\nBut, remember, universal antivenom could only be produced via cellular production methods. Why? Because there is, as far as I can tell, no known methods to easily elicit arbitrary antibodies (as in, the universal ones we want) from animals, you need to genetically modify cells to do it. And non-animal antivenom production startups haven’t been particularly successful!\\nBut perhaps history won’t repeat. The improved market opportunity may very well push pharmaceutical companies to reconsider cell-based production methods, since a trustworthy antivenom would skyrocket demand. And without the burden of animal management, venom procurement, and purification processes, this would push production costs down even more, making investment here further attractive.\\nIn such a world, the antivenom shortage problem would be solved outright, becoming a very tolerable expense for anyone unlucky enough to be bit by a deadly snake. No antivenom company will earn tens of billions working here, but will likely comfortably recoup their investments and achieve modest returns. A sustainable market attractive to both public and private investors. And likely also one that is trusted as an area for non-profits/governments to sponsor.\\nWhich world do we live in?\\nI’m unsure.\\nIt feels like protein design models really only solve the first bit, the creation of near-universal antivenoms. While intellectually interesting, the utility of these antivenoms would rely on cell-based production of those antivenoms, which is a tall order. Not because it’s a hard problem; in many ways, it’s likely solved, given that we have mass-produced antibody drugs available on the market produced in cell-based settings. But, rather, because it requires a huge amount of upfront capital and engineering work.\\nAnd antivenoms don’t seem to historically be a place where many people are willing to make that investment. But, given a sufficiently good protein design model that produces a good-enough universal antivenom, maybe that’ll change. Who knows?\\nAn addendum: the NYT article over universal antivenoms\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the same day I put out this essay, another antivenom-related article came out: Universal Antivenom May Grow Out of Man Who Let Snakes Bite Him 200 Times. Sad that I didn’t release this article far earlier! But there is a silver lining here: I can spend some time walking through the paper that came from this research, what it means, and answer some likely follow-up questions.\\nQuick background context: a man purposefully gets himself bitten by various snakes over 18 years. A scientist discovers this, realizes he may have acquired broadly neutralizing antibodies, and contacts him. He is right: he does indeed show astonishingly broadly protective effects against many venoms from the elapid class of snakes. From this set of ‘parent’ antibodies, they are mutated via phage display to come up with two ‘universal antibodies’. One named LNX-D09 and the other named SNX-B03. Importantly, neither of these are ‘natural’ antibodies, but are rather derived from the pre-existing set of antibodies found in the ‘hyperimmune’ man.\\nA curious note: the resulting Cell paper that came out of this cited the same antibody screening paper I cited in the last section (which went through 50 billion antibodies to find one that bound to all 3-finger toxins, or 3FTx, in elapid venom) and found remarkable sequence similarity between LNX-D09 and the one found via in-vitro screening, or 95Mat5:\\n“Comparing LNX-D09 to other anti-LNX antibodies revealed remarkable sequence convergence with 95Mat5, a broadly reactive antibody recently discovered from a synthetic yeast library. Both LNX-D09 and 95Mat5 share an identical and unusually long CDR-H3 length (95.4th percentile), three identical residues in a critical LNX-binding motif, and nearly identical light-chain sequences.”.\\nThey claim that LNX-D09 shows ‘greater breadth in protection’ compared to 95Mat5, but there doesn’t seem to be proof of this, only that there is tighter binding between the designed antibody and a specific venom. That said, while 95Mat5 is hyperspecific to 3FTx, LNX-D09 seems to confer very modest protection against other toxic proteins, like conferring protection to 1 out of 5 animals injected with a PLA2-dominant toxin. Low, but still!\\nSo what’s the purpose of SNX-B03? One curious note about 3FTx’s, they come in two forms: short-chain and long-chain, each of which bind to the same receptor (nAChR), but in different spots. And, remember, antibodies often work by replicating whatever its [target] usually binds to! SNX-B03 replicates the binding interface of where short-chain 3FTx’s bind, while LNX-D09 replicates that of the long-chain.\\nIn the end, the combination of these two drugs (along with a PLA2 specific antivenom) offered protection to an insane number of snake species. Not all! But a shocking chunk.\\nSome of the failure cases are curious. Why is efficacy so low for Russian cobra’s, which predominantly have 3FTx’s in their venom? The successes are also curious! For example, how does the LNX antibody alone offer protection against black mamba venom? Which have 3FTx’s, but also, as we discussed, a completely structurally independent + highly lethal protein: dendrotoxin.\\nOf course, caveats that this is in mice and not larger animals, which can dramatically alter the pharmokinetics of an antibody-based drug. But still! Really incredible work, and a very fun paper to read.\\nBut I should still iterate: achieving a universal antivenom is only one part of the challenge. The far bigger problem is the overwhelming majority of people who need this innovation are also people who cannot easily pay for it, which also compounds the problem of needing in-vitro production systems. It feels likely that universal antivenoms are at the early innings of the malaria vaccine: signs of efficacy, but still a decades-long slog to actually get it out there.\\nOne last thing before we end this.\\nThere’s a really, really obvious question that a few people have already asked. Why can’t we simply repeat this in animals? Fill a horse or sheep with a ton of different venoms and grab the broadly neutralizing antibodies? Why did we need this exceptionally strange ‘hyperimmune’ person who had been bitten 800 times over 18 years to create this paper?\\nAs it turns out, we’ve done this exact thing in animals before! In fact, in 2020, there was a Scientific Reports paper that had arguably even better results than this human one. Horses were immunized using a \"diverse toxin repertoire”, a carefully curated set of 12 neurotoxic venom fractions from multiple species. The result was a pan-specific antiserum that neutralized 36 different elapid venoms from 10 genera across 4 continents.\\nSo, what’s the point of this hyperimmune Cell paper?\\nThe important distinction here is that the antivenom derived from the horses was a heterogenous slurry of many different antibodies, all of which were natural. This isn’t the end of the world and is in fact how polyvalent antivenoms are made. But if we want to move to microbial production methods, which will be necessary to reduce costs, we can’t go down that route. There can often be hundreds of thousands of unique antibodies that can be found in blood, which would be intractable to produce.\\nWhat the Cell paper offered were two distinct non-natural antibodies derived from a pre-existing set of good, natural antibodies, the combination of which was all that was necessary to serve as an extremely effective antivenom.\\nThe authors of the horse paper could’ve done the exact same thing: isolate the most broadly neutralizing antibodies from their horses, sequence them, express them recombinantly, and find the best ones! But they didn’t. It may have just been the case that the authors were quite set on finding ways to make the existing antivenom production process, which relies on animals, better. Remember, if we have ‘few antibodies of importance’, that presents the opposite problem of the horse antivenom: cannot be produced in animals, since eliciting arbitrary antibodies from animals is really, really hard. But it does make microbial production far easier!\\nIt was a very interesting frame of reference required to arrive to the Cell paper, very ‘if you ask people what they want, they’d say a faster horse’. I wonder how many other research concepts that are out there where this ‘obvious follow-on’ isn’t being done, because the problem is being framed too narrowly; within the constraints of existing workflows, tools, or assumptions.\\nAnyway, that’s the end of this addendum. If you’re curious for more, I had a whole podcast with someone trying to make broadly-protective vaccines. Lots of similar thoughts echoed there!\\nNot just horses apparently … https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/snakes-universal-antivenom-tim-friede.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EE8.b1BN.gZ0RPnzYADAr&smid=url-share\\nA family member of mine got bit here in Australia and they didn’t even give them any anti venom as the risks of side effects wasn’t worth it. They said it was hell sweating it out so I would think there would even be a market here if you could make them more targeted!'}\n",

Deepfakes — AI-generated videos and other content that seem real but are meant to deceive — could be used to manipulate public opinion and harm people’s reputations. AI algorithms trained with data that is biased can amplify those biases, creating risks of discrimination in housing, employment, and banking.\\nWith the U.S. Congress demonstrating little appetite for passing federal legislation to regulate AI in the face of these risks, states are taking a proactive approach focused on a range of specific aspects of AI. In 2024, nearly 700 AI-related bills were introduced in state legislatures nationwide, focusing on issues like algorithmic bias, privacy, and protecting against AI-generated misinformation. (Currently, Colorado is the only state to enact a comprehensive law regulating AI. In The Connecticut, state Senate last year approved an AI bill sponsored by Sen. James Maroney but it stalled in the General Assembly.)\\nYale’s Digital Ethics Center (DEC) is assisting state legislators as they attempt to craft these AI regulations in ways that promote technological innovation while addressing potential risks. During a recent two-day summit, the DEC convened a group of scholars, state lawmakers from across the country, and representatives from the tech industry and nonprofit sector to share insights about how best to regulate AI through state legislation.\\n“We wanted the conversation to include as many voices as possible,” said Luciano Floridi, the DEC director and professor in the practice of cognitive science in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “That’s important because successful legislation that strikes a balance between protecting the public and encouraging innovation requires input from a variety of stakeholders.\\n“One of my favorite moments from the summit was when somebody told me that they’d never seen all these people together in the same room, which suggested we’d accomplished something important,” he said.\\nThe DEC organized the summit with Maroney, the Connecticut state senator who is leading efforts to enact AI legislation locally.\\n“The summit was a great learning experience for the legislators, but it was also a great networking event,” Maroney said. “It was an opportunity to connect with people and share ideas, which was extremely valuable.”\\nIt was the first in a series of conferences the DEC is planning that will convene stakeholders on variety of policy issues concerning digital technology. The next summit, planned for the fall, will focus on digital security.\\nThe agenda for the first summit, tailored to provoke structured conversations, featured seven discussion panels (and no formal lectures apart from brief introductory and closing remarks from Floridi and Maroney). The panel events included discussions about deepfakes, AI’s influence on elections, open-source developers who make AI software freely available, legislative influences from Europe and Washington, D.C., and how to coordinate legislation across states.\\nThe absence of federal AI regulations creates the potential for a patchwork of state laws that could contradict each other and stifle innovation, said Floridi, who had an advisory role in crafting the European Union’s AI regulations — the world’s first comprehensive AI regulations.\\n“Having 50 different state policies is not a sustainable way to do business,” he said. “States must craft legislation that is compatible with what other states are doing. Otherwise, companies are faced with trying to follow rule A in state one, rule B in state two, and rule C in state three.”\\nThe lack of federal rules also complicates regulating certain aspects of the technology at the state level, said Emmie Hine, a research associate at the DEC and one of the summit’s organizers.\\n“Deepfakes are difficult to legislate state by state,” Hine said. “You can imagine a case where a malicious deepfake goes viral in a state that criminalizes them, but the perpetrator resides in another state where deepfakes are legal. The victim has no legal recourse. Even if they reside in the same state, the victim has to sue the perpetrator — or perpetrators — individually.”\\nThe DEC will publish a scholarly article on lessons learned during the summit.\\nTensions emerged at times during the conversations, Hine said, including over the potential conflicts between regulation and innovation or between open-source software and security concerns. But, she added, the discussions showed there are avenues for working around conflicts.\\n“The legislators just want what’s best for their state,” she said. “They want their states to host thriving tech industries and they want to protect their constituents from potential risks. At the same time, the tech industry wants its products to be safe, which supports adoption and beneficial use. I think there was real value in just getting folks together in a room and speaking person to person instead of press release to press release.”\\nRegulating AI is not a zero-sum game, Floridi said.\\n“Nobody has to lose anything, and nobody has to win everything,” he said. “The idea is to strike a balance. Good legislation supports good innovation.”\\nThat message resonated with Maroney, the Connecticut lawmaker.\\n“That approach to negotiating will be helpful as I continue working on my legislation,” he said.'}\n",

      "\n",
      "• Snake venom’s extreme heterogeneity—varying between families, species, geographic regions, populations, and even an individual snake's age—makes traditional antivenom production expensive, technically challenging, and economically unattractive, especially for markets in lower-income regions.\n",

      "• Recent breakthroughs, including the identification and engineering of broadly neutralizing antibodies (some derived from a 'hyperimmune' individual and phage display methods), raise the prospect of near-universal antivenoms that could work against a wide variety of snake venoms, but broader problems remain: “A perfect computationally-designed antivenom doesn’t guarantee market incentives. It simply makes a previously terrible market slightly less terrible.”\n",
      "\n",
