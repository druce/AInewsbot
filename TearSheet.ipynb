On March 25, 2024, Oppenheimer reiterated its hold rating on Tesla, suggesting investors to \"buy the dip or bail?\" due to pricing dynamics and expectations of lower prices before buying. However, on the same day, Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities downgraded Tesla, along with Rivian and Nio, citing slowing electric vehicle (EV) demand, rising inventory levels, and pricing pressure. Additionally, Evercore ISI weighed in on Tesla's Model Y price hike, suggesting it could be a quarter-end marketing push rather than a significant shift in pricing strategy."
