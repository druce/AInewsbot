However, access to AI-enhanced mammography is currently uneven, and research is ongoing to determine if AI can match the effectiveness of dual radiologist readings.\\n* While AI can accelerate analysis and personalize treatment, challenges remain, including biased datasets and cost barriers for patients.  Advocacy for insurance coverage and diverse participation in clinical trials are needed to ensure equitable access.\\n*  The human element in healthcare must be preserved alongside AI advancements.
