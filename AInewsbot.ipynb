    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using langgraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- rewrite using an critic-refine flow, although one rewrite does an OK job\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "- use new stateful OpenAI API, make some persistent assistants instead of complex prompts\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

      "Social card title: Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens\n",
      "Social card description: We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.\n",

      "### **ℹ️ TL;DR**\n",
      "\n",
      "We're building the **AI-native operations layer for psychiatric care**. Not diagnostics, but what happens **_outside_** the visit—the real operational backend: scheduling, documentation, billing, intake, risk detection, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to build core infrastructure with real AI, **own** systems end-to-end, and work directly with a deeply technical founder still up to his neck in the code—read on.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hey—I'm Daniel, co-founder and CTO of Legion Health (YC S21).\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental health care is **operationally broken**—patients ghosted, clinicians buried in forms, payers chasing missing notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry is flooded with AI startups trying to automate away diagnosis—and even providers as a whole. **But diagnostics aren’t the bottleneck. Operations are.**\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we’re solving the _real_ problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "> \"What if operations worked?”\n",
      "\n",
      "We’re building a real-time, AI-powered backend for mental health clinics—**LLM agents + structured systems** that coordinate human care like it’s software. Think:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Automated intake that personalizes itself mid-call\n",
      "* AI copilots that document visits while verifying insurance\n",
      "* Risk detectors trained on full transcripts and events\n",
      "* Schedulers that close the loop without human friction\n",
      "\n",
      "And we’re already live. Our agent infrastructure supports over **2,000+ patients** — with **only one support human**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Unlike most AI startups, we are our own customer**. We operate our own large psychiatric practice. The systems you build directly impact our clinicians and patients _today_. No theoretical B2B pitches, begging for pilots, and months of stakeholder alignment and bureaucracy—just real-world, high-stakes operational challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "⭐ If you've felt like AI is being wasted on toy tools or B2B busywork—**come work on something real**.\n",

      "* A live agentic co-pilot (think “Cursor for care ops”) that actually reduces admin overhead\n",
      "* A functioning psychiatric practice with real clinicians, patients, and claims\n",
      "* A high-leverage AI architecture in motion—LLM tool use, RAG, event-driven infra\n",
      "* A clear path towards for an event-driven, simulation-capable architecture that self-improves\n",
      "* A small, intense team (\\~11 people) shipping daily—no dead weight\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Core Event-Driven Backend:** Architect and scale our Node.js / Next.js / TypeScript / Supabase (Postgres) / AWS stack. Design schemas, event flows, and APIs that power real-time, resilient psychiatric care ops.\n",
      "* **LLM Agent Infrastructure:** Build _actual agent loops_—tool use, memory, retry logic, context updates, feedback mechanisms. Not a demo. A co-worker.\n",
      "* **Human + AI Ops UX:** Shape real-time interfaces where human teammates and agents co-work, co-learn, and co-adapt. Agents learn by using the same UI our humans do.\n",
      "* **World-State Simulation:** Define the canonical state of a patient’s journey. Power alerting, planning, and agent behavior with a simulation of psychiatric care at scale.\n",
      "* **Data & Compliance:** Engineer secure, HIPAA-compliant pipelines for transcripts, events, and EHR data—structured for both operations _and_ AI training.\n",
      "* **System Design & Strategy:** You’ll work directly with Danny (CTO) to debate architecture, invent new primitives, and define the foundation for AI-native mental health systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ll help answer questions at the frontier of AI, like:\n",

      "Social card title: Toward a Sparse and Interpretable Audio Codec\n",
      "Social card description: Most widely-used modern audio codecs, such as Ogg Vorbis and MP3, as well as more recent \"neural\" codecs like Meta's Encodec or the Descript Audio Codec are based on block-coding; audio is divided into overlapping, fixed-size \"frames\" which are then compressed. While they often yield excellent reproductions and can be used for downstream tasks such as text-to-audio, they do not produce an intuitive, directly-interpretable representation. In this work, we introduce a proof-of-concept audio encoder that represents audio as a sparse set of events and their times-of-occurrence. Rudimentary physics-based assumptions are used to model attack and the physical resonance of both the instrument being played and the room in which a performance occurs, hopefully encouraging a sparse, parsimonious, and easy-to-interpret representation.\n",

       "• The Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, signed into law in May 2024, is the first comprehensive state AI regulation in the U.S., imposing new duties to prevent discriminatory outcomes by AI systems in key areas like hiring and lending, affecting companies with over 50 employees.  \n",
       "• The law has faced criticism from businesses and industry groups for being too vague, broad, and burdensome, with recent efforts to modify and delay it failing due to conflicting stakeholder demands; a special legislative session would be required to make changes before enforcement.\n",

      "Social card title: An inherently interpretable AI model improves screening speed and accuracy for early diabetic retinopathy\n",
      "Social card description: Author summary AI systems designed to support clinical decision making use black-box deep learning models for many medical applications. This includes AI-based screening systems for diabetic retinopathy, a sight threatening complication of diabetes. This hinders clinical uptake of such methods, as clinicians and patients do not have a way to validate the AI systems decisions. Sometimes, post-hoc methods are used to generate heatmaps that supposedly explain the AI systems decision. However, these methods are problematic as the generated explanations do not reflect the actual decision-making process of the model and are prone to spurious correlations. In our paper, we take a big step forward for enabling trustworthy AI systems for supporting clinical decision making in screening for diabetic retinopathy: We introduce an inherently interpretable deep learning model which provides human-understandable explanations for its decisions. The model combines the power of deep learning with the interpretability of simpler models such as logistic regression by computing an explicit evidence map. This map forms the basis of the model’s decisions, alleviating the issues of post-hoc techniques. We validate the clinical potential of this model for improving diabetic retinopathy screening showing highlighting regions with high disease evidence during clinical grading decreased the grading time significantly and improved grading accuracy for difficult borderline cases.\n",
