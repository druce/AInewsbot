    "1. initial scrape of front pages of tech sites\n",
    "  - Open URLs of news sites specififed in `sources` dict (sources.yaml) using Selenium and Firefox\n",
    "  - Save HTML of each URL in htmldata directory  \n",
    "  - Extract URLs from all files, create a pandas dataframe with url, title, src\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter and clean to AI-related headlines not seen before\n",
    "  - Use ChatGPT prompt to filter only AI-related headlines by sending a prompt and formatted table of headlines\n",
    "  - Use SQLite to filter headlines previously seen \n",
    "  - remove duplicate URLs and headlines\n",
    "  - ensure there are pretty source names for each news site\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Topic analysis, make a list of topics for each headline\n",
    "  - using a prompt, check each headline against a number of evergreen AI topics, e.g. deepfakes, regulation, AI in education\n",
    "  - extract free from topics from each headline\n",
    "  - combine topics into topic list for each headline\n",
    "  - cluster headlines using dimensionality-reduced embeddings and DBSCAN; ask chatgpt to name each cluster\n",
    "  - sort headlines by doing a traveling salesman shortest traversal in embedding space\n",

    "7. human should make a list of the day's topics, combining the chatgpt response to the quesion and cluster topics and \n",

    "1. prompt to edit final copy for dupes, combine similar sections, copy edit\n",
    "2. have a reviewer prompt check if there are any bullet points to move to a different section \n",
    "3. if so have an editor prompt remove them , return to 2. until nothing left to move dupes left\n",
    "4. have a reviewer check each section, identify bullet points that are similar to other bullet points in the section and have identical links. rewrite combining so there is no duplication. \n",
    "5. identify sections that are short or similar to other sections and suggest sections that should be combined them\n",
    "6. have an editor prompt merge short sections, return to 4, until no orphan sections left\n",
