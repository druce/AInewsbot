    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using LangGraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Perform headline topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Scrape and summarize individual articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern, this is more prompt chaining than a proper agent\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- write currently uses a complex prompt with all the stories instead\n",
    "  - filter to eg top 50 by rating\n",
    "  - ignoring stories with already assigned bucket, use a model_medium prompt to put each story in an existing topic bucket, or other\n",
    "  - write a section independently for each non-empty topic bucket using model_high\n",
    "  - assemble all the sections and rewrite using a critic-refine flow\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "- use new stateful OpenAI API, make some persistent assistants instead of complex prompts\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",

    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

      "Social card title: Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning\n",
      "Social card description: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.\n",

      "Social card description: Initial value problems---a system of ordinary differential equations and corresponding initial conditions---can be used to describe many physical phenomena including those arise in classical mechanics. We have developed an approach to solve physics-based initial value problems using unsupervised machine learning. We propose a deep learning framework that models the dynamics of a variety of mechanical systems through neural networks. Our framework is flexible, allowing us to solve nonlinear, coupled, and chaotic dynamical systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on systems including a free particle, a particle in a gravitational field, a classical pendulum, and the H\\'enon-Heiles system (a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators with a nonlinear perturbation, used in celestial mechanics). Our results show that deep neural networks can successfully approximate solutions to these problems, producing trajectories which conserve physical properties such as energy and those with stationary action. We note that probabilistic activation functions, as defined in this paper, are required to learn any solutions of initial value problems in their strictest sense, and we introduce coupled neural networks to learn solutions of coupled systems.\n",

      "• He reiterated previous warnings about the rapid progress of AI, estimating it may take 5–20 years for AI to become a significant threat, though he added, \"It is still possible that the threat will not materialize.\"\n",
      "2025-05-20 08:20:48,380 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 216 (length 4335): • The Uptime Institute reports that the AI industry lacks an effective, standardized metric for gauging whether GPUs are being used optimally, with even well-optimized models typically utilizing only 35–45% of available compute performance.\n",
      "• Current GPU usage tracking methods, such as average operational time or proprietary monitoring tools, have significant limitations and often overstate actual GPU efficiency.\n",
      "• The report identifies model FLOPS utilization (MFU) as a promising, though complex, metric for assessing GPU effectiveness, but highlights that real-world factors make scores above 50% rare and more industry data is needed to define efficient usage benchmarks.\n",
      "2025-05-20 08:20:48,381 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 217 (length 4335): • The Uptime Institute reports that despite the high cost of GPUs used in AI, there is no effective industry metric for gauging whether these resources are being utilized optimally, with even well-optimized models typically using only 35–45% of available compute performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The report highlights that commonly used methods for tracking GPU utilization, such as monitoring server operation time or GPU load via hardware tools, do not accurately reflect true efficiency. A promising alternative, Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU), tracks model performance relative to hardware capability but is difficult to calculate and often yields seemingly low efficiency figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Uptime concludes that while MFU offers a more direct link to power consumption and efficiency, the lack of accessible real-world data and proprietary use of metrics limits the industry’s ability to benchmark and improve GPU utilization.\n",
