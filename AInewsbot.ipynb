    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using LangGraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs for non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Also remove duplicates/seen before, (match URL or title+domain, or 90% cosine similarity of normalized text)\n",
    "- Summarize downloaded artcles, perform topic analysis via prompts (vs. traditional NMF or LDA, is zero-shot w/o training and also should have deep semantic understanding)\n",
    "- Rerank and filter the articles for quality, recency, site reputation, dedupe again for similarity to other articles and keep highest ranked\n",
    "- Send top articles by max marginal relevance to a large prompt\n",
    "- Use a loop to polish and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.beehiiv.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern, this is more prompt chaining than a proper agent\n",
    "  - use OpenAI agents SDK instead of langgraph\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "  - implement proper critic-optimizer loop logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- write currently uses a complex prompt with all the stories instead\n",
    "  - maybe write each section independently, assemble all the sections and rewrite using a critic-refine flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "\n",
    "- must retrain dimensionality reduction, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

      "Social card title: Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task\n",
      "Social card description: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.\n",

Subbaro Kambhampati and Yann LeCun seem to agree. You could say that the paper knocked out LLMs. More recently, a comment paper showed up on Arxiv and shared around X as a rebuttal to Apple’s paper. Putting aside the stunt of having Claude Opus as a co-author (yes, I’m not kidding), the paper in itself is a poor rebuttal for many reasons which we shall explore, but mainly for missing the entire point of the paper and prior research by AI researchers such as Professor Kambhampati.\n",

      "Social card description: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.\n",

Subbaro Kambhampati and Yann LeCun seem to agree. You could say that the paper knocked out LLMs. More recently, a comment paper showed up on Arxiv and shared around X as a rebuttal to Apple’s paper. Putting aside the stunt of having Claude Opus as a co-author (yes, I’m not kidding), the paper in itself is a poor rebuttal for many reasons which we shall explore, but mainly for missing the entire point of the paper and prior research by AI researchers such as Professor Kambhampati.\n",

      "- Waymo has temporarily restricted its service areas in response to protests to ensure passenger safety, leading to criticism and claims of discrimination, as human-driven ride-hailing services continued operations in affected neighborhoods.  \n",

      "- The process involves scanning a cleaned painting, using AI to model its original appearance, creating a digital restoration map, and printing this onto a clear polymer film with color and white ink layers that can be applied and later removed without harming the original artwork.  \n",

      "- The study confirmed that two biblical scroll fragments, 4QDanielc and 4QQoheleta, date back to the eras of their traditionally attributed anonymous authors (2nd and 3rd centuries BCE), providing new insights into script development, literacy, and historical contexts of the Hellenistic and early Roman periods.\n",
