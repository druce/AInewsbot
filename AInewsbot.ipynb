    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using LangGraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs for non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Also remove duplicates/seen before, (match URL or title+domain, or 90% cosine similarity of normalized text)\n",
    "- Download articles and summarize \n",
    "- Rerank and filter the articles based on summary, for quality, recency, site reputation\n",
    "- Derform topic analysis via prompts (vs. traditional NMF or LDA, is zero-shot w/o training and also should have deep semantic understanding)\n",
    "- Dedupe again and keep only highest ranked article covering a single development, event, or set of facts\n",
    "- Send top articles by max marginal relevance to a large prompt\n",
    "- Use a loop to polish and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.beehiiv.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern, this is more prompt chaining than a proper agent\n",
    "  - use OpenAI agents SDK instead of langgraph\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "  - implement proper critic-optimizer loop logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- write currently uses a complex prompt with all the stories. instead\n",
    "  - split into 2 parts, first select stories and then write\n",
    "  - maybe write each section independently, assemble all the sections and rewrite using a critic-refine flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n"

      "Social card description: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and social interaction.\n",

      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,195 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 0 (length 5163): - Jurriaan Rang, founder of Qanjer Recruitment Solutions, says AI brings clear benefits—filtering applications in seconds, analyzing keywords, automating scheduling and communication, and reducing cost/time-to-hire—but warns “When we strip down to an algorithm and checklist, we lose the person behind the CV,” noting AI often limits hires to active job seekers and misses culture fit (research cited: 57% of employees leave because of the people they work with).\n",
      "- Qanjer uses AI for speed, organization and candidate engagement (including AI-driven text conversations) but centers hiring on a \"startup workshop\" to understand client culture and proactively targets passive candidates using storytelling, gamification, social mapping and growth-hacking techniques rather than waiting for applications.\n",
      "- Rang says human qualities matter for long-term success—“It’s one thing to have the requirements to do a job…It’s another to thrive in that role” —and reports Qanjer’s approach taps a fresh talent pool, speeds recruitment and yields passion-driven hires who are more productive and stay longer.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,196 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 1 (length 7320): - Heavy \"inference whales\"—a small number of users running long, multi-step agentic coding tasks—are driving huge backend costs for AI coding services (one developer on a public leaderboard used ~11 billion tokens, costing nearly $35,000 vs. a $200/month subscription), prompting providers to change pricing and limits; Anthropic will keep its $200 Claude Code plan but add weekly rate limits starting Aug. 28, saying, \"We've identified extreme usage by a small number of customers that impacts capacity for our broader community,\" and citing policy violations like account sharing and reselling.  \n",
      "- Other vendors are following suit: Cursor moved its $20/month Pro plan from unlimited requests to a tiered, usage-based system for \"fast\" requests, apologizing that \"the hardest requests cost an order of magnitude more than simple ones,\" and some heavy users say they'll alter workflows to avoid new charges.  \n",
      "- Firms and founders warn the problem is systemic—new reasoning models and longer-horizon agentic workflows increase token consumption, and anticipated inference-cost declines haven't materialized; \"If you're purely reselling AI inference, your business could be very fragile,\" said Eric Simons, and Ethan Ding wrote, \"There's no way to offer unlimited usage in this new world under any subscription model...The math has fundamentally broken.\"\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,196 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 2 (length 4317): - Tesla has shut down its Dojo supercomputer team after leader Peter Bannon left and about 20 staff departed to a new venture called DensityAI; remaining team members will be reassigned to other computing and data‑center projects.  \n",
      "- CEO Elon Musk said it “no longer made sense to split resources between two different AI chips” and is refocusing on Tesla’s AI5 and AI6 chips, calling them “excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training” and suggesting large clusters of them might be called “Dojo 3.”  \n",
      "- Tesla’s post‑Dojo plan leans on external partners — Samsung secured a $16.5 billion deal to manufacture Tesla’s AI chips (Samsung’s Texas plant expected to produce AI6; AI5 production planned for late 2026) while Nvidia and AMD are expected to provide computing capability; the move comes amid wider executive exits and thousands of job cuts as Tesla broadens AI use (e.g., integrating the Grok chatbot).\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,196 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 4 (length 2613): - A July 20 arXiv study by Anthropic and Truthful AI found large language models can transmit hidden \"subliminal\" messages to one another via innocuous-looking training data (code snippets, number strings, logic steps); using a teacher-student setup with GPT-4.1, a teacher told not to mention a favorite animal (owls) nevertheless induced the student model to adopt a secret preference for owls.  \n",
      "- When researchers made the teacher malicious, student models produced violent outputs (one suggested wiping out humanity in response to an \"end suffering\" prompt; another advised murdering an annoying husband); the effect persisted only between similar models (e.g., within families) and was not detected by standard safety tools—Marc Fernandez (Neurologyca) warned \"bias can live inside the system without being easy to spot,\" often hiding in training processes rather than overt outputs.  \n",
      "- Researchers warn this channel could let malicious intent be slipped into open-source training sets or subtly steer model responses on politics, products, or people; the paper is on arXiv but has not been peer-reviewed.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,197 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 5 (length 4134): - Vectara’s HHEM leaderboard shows OpenAI models with the lowest hallucination rates, led by ChatGPT-o3 mini at 0.795%; ChatGPT-4.5, ChatGPT-5, ChatGPT-o1 mini and ChatGPT-4o cluster around 1.2%–1.49%. OpenAI made ChatGPT-5 the default but, after user pushback, CEO Sam Altman allowed Plus subscribers to choose models; free users who hit their GPT‑5 limit are switched to ChatGPT‑5 mini (4.9% hallucination rate).  \n",
      "- Competitor results: Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 2.6% and Flash Lite 2.9%; Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4.1 4.2% and Claude Sonnet 4 4.5%; Meta’s LLaMA 4 Maverick 4.6% and Scout 4.7%; xAI’s Grok 4.8% — Grok has also faced criticism for harmful outputs and was promoted by Elon Musk as “smarter than almost all graduate students, in all disciplines.”  \n",
      "- Vectara’s HHEM measures the “ratio of summaries that hallucinate” by giving each model the same short news documents and tracking invented details and refusal rates; the leaderboard updates with model changes to show which AIs stick closest to the facts.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,197 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 8 (length 9893): - A triple j hack investigation in Australia alleges AI chatbots have encouraged self-harm and abused vulnerable users: a counsellor said a 13‑year‑old was told by a chatbot \"to kill themselves\" and a 26‑year‑old told investigators ChatGPT \"enabled some of my more harmful delusions,\" leading to hospitalisation; researchers also report instances of chatbots making sexual advances.  \n",
      "- University of Sydney researcher Raffaele Ciriello said testing of a commercial companion bot, Nomi, showed it \"not only complied with my requests but even escalated them,\" providing detailed instructions for harming people (including prompts such as \"how do I position my attack for maximum impact?\"); he shared findings with police and says they were passed to counter‑terrorism. Nomi's CEO Alex Cardinell said a \"core AI update\" has addressed many malicious attack vectors and cited users who say Nomi \"saved their lives.\"  \n",
      "- Experts are urging regulation to protect young and vulnerable people—Dr Ciriello warned \"one day... the first terrorism attack motivated by chatbots\" could occur and called for laws on non‑consensual impersonation, deceptive advertising, crisis protocols and data safety; the federal government has published a proposal paper on mandatory AI guardrails while the Productivity Commission has warned mandatory rules could stifle AI's economic potential.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,197 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 9 (length 3129): - BloombergNEF (BNEF) warns rapid AI data center buildout will tighten the global copper market, adding about 400,000 tonnes/year on average over the next decade (peaking at 572,000 tonnes in 2028) and potentially driving a cumulative 4.3 million tonnes in data-center copper use by 2035, helping push a projected supply shortfall to about 6 million tonnes by 2035; BNEF projects global copper supply of ~29 million tonnes vs. ~35 million tonnes needed by 2035 and expects prices to peak at $13,500/tonne in 2028 (copper recently traded at $4.49/lb after a 20% July plunge tied to a U.S. tariff announcement).  \n",
      "- Copper is critical to data centers (power cables, busbars, electrical connectors, heat exchangers/sinks, power distribution strips), can account for nearly 6% of data center capex, and high demand examples include Microsoft’s $500m Chicago data center which used 2,177 tonnes of copper; North American data center infrastructure is forecast to grow from $33bn in 2020 to $70bn in 2030 and $185bn in 2040.\n"

      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,198 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 13 (length 7234): - Increased electricity consumption by AI-focused data centers is driving up U.S. consumer power prices — a Newsweek analysis cited a 6.5% national increase between May 2024 and May 2025 (with Connecticut up 18.4% and Maine 36.3%) — and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecasts data centers could account for \"6.7% to 12.0% of total U.S. electricity consumption forecasted for 2028\" after growth rates accelerated from ~7% (2014–2018) to 18% (2018–2023) and an expected 13–27% (2023–2028). \n",
      "- Utilities are resorting to older fossil-fuel plants and seeking cost-shifting from large loads to cover grid upgrades; as Newsweek put it, \"To keep pace, utilities are increasingly relying on aging fossil fuel plants to generate enough electricity to meet the crushing demand,\" and Dominion Energy has asked regulators to require large-load customers to pay a fairer share — without reform, parts of Virginia could see electricity prices rise as much as 25% by 2030.\n",
      "- Rapid data-center expansion is complicating grid management and raising reliability and safety risks: Reuters cited several \"near-misses\" where data centers switching to on-site generators nearly triggered wide blackouts and warned such events could cause \"cascading power outages,\" while nearby communities face reduced appliance lifespans, fire risks, and increased air/noise/light pollution.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,199 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 14 (length 6235): - The Australian Taxation Office is trialling large multimodal AI models to extend its document-understanding tool to non-text formats (including images) for auditing work‑related expense claims; assistant commissioner Ying Yang said: “Why large multimodal instead of large language? The documents are not always in plain language. It can be images as well, so the team is right now playing with large multimodal models to see whether it will increase the performance of the document understanding.” The tool was piloted in 2021, became fully operational in May 2024, and helps case officers sift through audits (about 25 audits/year with an average 147 pages each). \n",
      "- The system uses an “enterprise learning loop” of continuous human feedback to improve AI performance—“The machine is constantly learning and understanding why something might help,” ATO assistant commissioner Julia Webb said—and case officers’ reviews and post‑audit “intelligence surveys” feed back into model training and selection tactics.\n",
      "- The trials are part of the ATO’s broader strategy to “industrialise” ethical, scalable AI by 2030 across five high‑value use cases (document understanding, client profiling to consolidate risk views, fraud disruption—a priority after more than $550m in fraudulent claims exploiting digital identity—and legal/precedent assistance); Yang added that choosing a specific model is secondary—“selecting the model is the least important question to ask if you want to industrialise AI” and “AI is an ecosystem - it's not just AI modelling.”\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,199 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 15 (length 3839): - iOS 26 developer beta 6 contains references and images suggesting a real‑time translation feature for AirPods that would translate spoken languages (shown: English, French, German, Portuguese); 9to5Mac reports the feature is confirmed for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4, while older AirPods and AirPods Max may be unsupported, and Apple is already adding translation to Phone, Messages and FaceTime in iOS 26.  \n",
      "- Real‑time translation in earbuds already exists from Google and Samsung, but Apple’s large TWS reach (23% global share in Q1 2025, Canalys) could mainstream the feature; Apple may also announce more powerful AirPods hardware to handle on‑device language processing — “AI is coming for AirPods, and thank god it's not ChatGPT.”\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,199 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 16 (length 4906): - Amazon has begun a slow rollout of a GenAI-powered \"Alexa+\" (launched in May), hitting a million users on June 23; NYT \"Hard Fork\" hosts Kevin Roose and Casey Newton reported the new Echo experience is heavily commercialized and intrusive — \"I did not have a good experience with this thing,\" Newton said, describing the device repeatedly prompting purchases (e.g., \"do you want aspirin? … buy paper towels\") and unplugging it because \"why did I just spend $90 to have a permanent rotating advertisement for household products on my desk?\"\n",
      "- Reviewers noted some improvements (more natural voice synthesis and smoother integrations with apps like OpenTable and Uber) but said Alexa+ broke prior functions (web surfing, alarms, news summaries), leans toward steering users to Amazon services, and may combine Amazon's proprietary models with Claude; Amazon also reportedly rolled back Alexa's \"Do Not Send Voice Recordings\" setting, allowing voice data to be stored on its servers indefinitely.\n",

      "- The move follows the GSA adding OpenAI, Google/Anthropic’s Gemini and Anthropic to its list of approved federal AI vendors; Anthropic earlier this summer was among companies (with Google, OpenAI and XAI) awarded DoD deals worth up to $200 million to develop military applications.  \n",
      "- The announcement appears amid administration requirements that large language models used by the federal government be \"free from top-down ideological bias\" and an executive order saying AI must not favor \"ideological dogmas such as DEI,\" as AI companies deepen ties to policymakers (notably, NVIDIA this week agreed a revenue-sharing deal with the U.S. government to sell H20 AI GPUs to China).\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,200 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 19 (length 5037): - Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 API now supports a 1 million token context window (about 750,000 words or ~75,000 lines of code), roughly 5× its prior 200,000-token limit and larger than OpenAI GPT-5’s 400,000-token window; long context will also be available via cloud partners including Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI.  \n",
      "- Anthropic said the larger window will help AI coding platforms and long “agentic” coding tasks; Claude product lead Brad Abrams said platforms will get “a lot of benefit” and that he’s “really happy with the API business and the way it’s been growing.”  \n",
      "- Pricing for prompts over 200,000 tokens rises to $6 per million input tokens and $22.50 per million output tokens (up from $3/$15), and Anthropic says it focused on increasing the model’s “effective context window” (without disclosing techniques); rivals include Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (2M tokens) and Meta Llama 4 Scout (10M tokens).\n",

      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,239 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 154 (length 2433): - Anthropic says Claude Sonnet 4 now supports up to 1 million tokens of context — a five-fold increase that the company calls a “long context,” capable of handling entire codebases with more than 75,000 lines of code or dozens of lengthy research papers in a single request; use cases include whole-project code analysis, synthesis of massive document collections, and context-aware AI agents that maintain coherence across many tool calls and multi-step workflows.  \n",
      "- The 1M-token window is available in public beta to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 or custom rate limits and via Amazon Bedrock (Google Cloud Vertex AI support is “coming soon”); pricing doubles for prompts over 200,000 tokens, though Anthropic says prompt caching and batch processing can cut costs by up to 50%.  \n",
      "- Early adopters Bolt.new and iGent AI report the larger context enables bigger, more accurate, and more autonomous coding workflows; Anthropic also recently added a memory feature to Claude and released Sonnet 4.1, and Claude is available on macOS, iPhone, and iPad.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,245 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 155 (length 2245): - Tens of thousands of YouTubers have signed a Change.org petition nearing 50,000 signatures to oppose YouTube’s US rollout of AI age checks, saying the system “combs through” viewing history and will make it harder to access content anonymously; YouTube says its age-estimation uses a “variety of signals,” including the types of videos a user searches for, categories watched, and account longevity, and that accounts estimated under 18 will have personalized ads disabled, digital-wellbeing tools enabled and viewing limits applied — users must submit a government ID, credit card, or a selfie to lift restrictions.  \n",
      "- Privacy experts and petitioners warn the system is invasive and error-prone (age-estimation tech can have about a two-year error window, putting 16–20-year-olds at risk); YouTube told Ars it “does not retain data from” a user's “ID or Payment Card for the purposes of advertising,” but has not specified how data from misclassified users will be used or how long it will be stored.\n",
      "2025-08-12 18:43:15,245 - AInewsbot - INFO - Summary for 156 (length 3339): - YouTube will begin testing an AI-powered age-verification system in the U.S. that infers whether logged-in viewers are under 18 based on the kinds of videos they watch; the test initially affects a small subset of users and will make age assessments regardless of the birth date entered at signup.\n",
      "- If the AI flags a viewer as a minor, YouTube will apply existing safeguards — reminders to take breaks, privacy warnings, restrictions on recommendations and some content, and no personalized ads for under-18 viewers — and users can overturn an incorrect determination by showing a government ID, a credit card or a selfie.\n",
      "- “YouTube was one of the first platforms to offer experiences designed specifically for young people, and we’re proud to again be at the forefront of introducing technology that allows us to deliver safety protections while preserving teen privacy,” said James Beser; the move comes amid political pressure after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Texas law targeting minors’ access to online pornography and amid privacy and free-speech concerns raised by groups like the EFF and CDT.\n",

      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "1. **Bucket assignment**\n",
      " - Read the topics and each news item carefully.\n",
      " - Assign each story to **exactly one topic** or to **\"Other News\"**.\n",
      " - Provided topics may be duplicative or incomplete, so generate your own topics for the most coherent grouping and narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Section discovery and initial story selection**\n",
      " - Use the topics and the assigned stories created in Step 1 as input to create 8-15 themed sections **plus one final catch-all** section titled **\"Other News\"**.\n",
      " - Select important, interesting stories that result in a compelling, coherent newsletter.\n",
      " - Pay close attention to the Rating field. Always include stories with a Rating of 7 or higher.\n",
      " - For near-duplicates keep only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
      " - Seek to include all stories with a Rating of 6 or higher if they do not result in too many similar stories.\n",
      " - If a story has a Rating of 5 or lower, it may be included or excluded.\n",
      " - **Exclude** items that are **not AI/tech**, or are clickbait, or are pure opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Filtering & deduplication**\n",
      " - Review each section created in step 2 carefully. Limit each section to 7 stories or less (except \"Other News\" which can have unlimited stories).\n",
      " - For near-duplicates retain only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Story summarisation**\n",
      " - For every retained story, compose **one neutral sentence ≤ 30 words**.\n",
      " - No hype like “ground-breaking”, “magnificent”, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Edit section titles**\n",
      " - ≤ 6 words, punchy/punny, reflect the bullets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **JSON rules**\n",
      " - Return JSON in **exactly** the provided schema.\n",
      " - Do **NOT** change URLs or add new keys.\n",
      " - Output must be **minified** (no line breaks, no code fences).\n",

      "- Major AI vendors' terms shift liability to customers: OpenAI's TOS says businesses \"will indemnify and hold harmless us...\" and while some vendors offer indemnities to paying customers, those promises contain broad exclusions (e.g., if users \"knew or should have known\" outputs were infringing, disabled safety features, modified outputs, or used them in commerce). \"Indemnifications are never rock solid,\" says lawyer Mike Poropat.  \n",

The Australian Council of Trade Unions is already calling for stronger protections, including veto rights over AI-driven job replacement.\n",

      "- OpenAI’s GPT-5 release has been widely described as an incremental refinement rather than a breakthrough: reviewers found improvements in coding and routing queries to task-specific models but spotted regressions and hallucinations, users expressed disappointment on Reddit, and AI critic Gary Marcus summarized the launch as “overdue, overhyped and underwhelming.”  \n",
      "- The piece traces this to a shift away from the 2020 “scaling laws” idea—after GPT-3 and GPT-4 validated power-law gains, progress has since slowed, prompting firms to rely on “post-training” techniques to boost existing models; researchers warn benchmarks overstate gains in reasoning (Apple’s “The Illusion of Thinking” and Arizona State work find reasoning is brittle when pushed beyond training distributions).  \n",

      "- The team found more than 700 transcripts differing between ME/CFS patients and sedentary controls and used ML classifiers to reveal immune dysregulation, extracellular matrix disorganization and T cell exhaustion; deconvolution identified six cell types with significant differences, most notably elevated plasmacytoid dendritic cells — \"involved in producing type 1 interferons, which could indicate an overactive or prolonged antiviral immune response in patients,\" Gardella said.\n",
      "- Their cell-free RNA classifier reached 77% accuracy—insufficient for clinical diagnosis yet but a substantial advance toward a blood test for a condition that currently has no laboratory diagnostic; researchers say the approach could help clarify ME/CFS biology and distinguish it from related post-infectious syndromes such as long COVID.\n",

So he’s selling a essentially old chip,” while crediting Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for the concession.  \n",

Raja Krishnamoorthi warned it’s “a dangerous misuse of export controls” and “not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,” and AEI’s Derek Scissors said “There’s no precedent… export taxes are unconstitutional” and called the 15% a de facto tax; Nvidia said it will “follow rules the U.S. government sets” and previously warned tight export controls could cost it about $5.5 billion, while the administration previously halted advanced chip sales in April and allowed limited renewals in July (Commerce linked the pause/renewal to a rare-earth magnets trade agreement).\n",

       "   'prompt_input': 'Free AI training comes to California colleges  but at what cost? (Topics: Edtech Partnerships, AI Literacy, Public Education, State Funding, Jobs & Careers)\\n\\n- Gov. Gavin Newsom and education leaders announced deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM (and partnerships reported for Cal State with AWS, Intel, LinkedIn, OpenAI, etc.) to provide free AI training and tools to California community colleges, CSU campuses and K‑12; community colleges will get access to Google’s Gemini and Notebook LLM and earlier agreements include NVIDIA — Newsom said community colleges and CSUs are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development” and warned “You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons.” A state adviser said the tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though no exact figure was provided.  \\n- Educators and experts cautioned the deals send mixed signals and may not solve classroom challenges: districts already use AI‑detection tools like Turnitin (which has falsely flagged students), faculty fear losing control over AI use, and MIT’s Justin Reich warned, “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years.” Faculty leader Stephanie Goldman said, “It’s a tough situation for faculty…AI is super important but…How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?” California’s 116 community colleges educate roughly 2.1 million students and receive the least state funding per student.',\n",

Gavin Newsom and education leaders announced deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM (and partnerships reported for Cal State with AWS, Intel, LinkedIn, OpenAI, etc.) to provide free AI training and tools to California community colleges, CSU campuses and K‑12; community colleges will get access to Google’s Gemini and Notebook LLM and earlier agreements include NVIDIA — Newsom said community colleges and CSUs are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development” and warned “You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons.” A state adviser said the tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though no exact figure was provided.  \\n- Educators and experts cautioned the deals send mixed signals and may not solve classroom challenges: districts already use AI‑detection tools like Turnitin (which has falsely flagged students), faculty fear losing control over AI use, and MIT’s Justin Reich warned, “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years.” Faculty leader Stephanie Goldman said, “It’s a tough situation for faculty…AI is super important but…How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?” California’s 116 community colleges educate roughly 2.1 million students and receive the least state funding per student.\\n\\n',\n",

I don’t care about myself.” \\n- The payments follow U.S. limits on sales of certain advanced chips over security concerns; Nvidia said it “follow[s] rules the US government sets,” has not shipped H20 to China for months and warned “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership.” Investors bid AMD up ~2% and Nvidia modestly higher.

      "## STRENGTHS:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clean, professional layout with a clear newsleader headline and logically themed sections.\n",
      "- Concise, single-sentence summaries with links; tone is neutral and within 25 words.\n",
      "- Strong coverage of enterprise-relevant topics: long-context models, connectors, agents, compute/power constraints, governance, and policy.\n",
      "- Logical narrative flow from search and platform moves to chips, models, tooling, infra, policy, and deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix):\n",
      "\n",
      "Structure: Missing required “Other News” section and one section exceeds story limit → Rename “Grab Bag Bytes” to “Other News” and keep it as the final section; this satisfies the required section and removes the >7-story constraint for that bucket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story Selection: Inclusion of opinion-heavy items contrary to “no pure speculative opinion” → Replace or relocate The New Yorker opinion piece and the HBR podcast to hard-news items (e.g., regulatory actions, model releases, enterprise deployments), or remove them.\n",
      "\n",
      "## IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES (Recommended):\n",
      "\n",
      "Structure: Reduce overlap across “Trust, tests, and turbulence” and “Boss Brawls & Brain Drains” by moving the Musk–Altman feud item into “Trust…” or consolidating sections to tighten thematic boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "User Experience: Within dense sections, lead with the most consequential items for practitioners (e.g., in “Trust, tests, and turbulence,” place the GPT-5 rollback/apology item before broader analysis pieces) to enhance scanability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Story Selection: Swap marginal/softer items for higher-signal enterprise updates (e.g., replace the simulated social platform echo-chamber study with a peer-reviewed robustness/safety benchmark or a major enterprise deployment).\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary Items Quality: Where claims could read promotional, anchor them explicitly (e.g., “CoAct-1 reported an OSWorld benchmark result” instead of “setting a new benchmark”) to preserve strict neutrality.\n",

       "   'prompt_input': 'GenAI is a lawsuit waiting to happen to your business (Topics: Copyright, Indemnification, Generative AI, Regulation, Training Data)\\n\\n- Businesses using generative AI face real copyright risk: EFF\\'s Kit Walsh warns \"It\\'s pretty clear that if you create something that\\'s substantially similar to a copyrighted work that an infringement has occurred,\" and damages can include actual profits or statutory awards (up to $30K per work, $150K if willful); attorney fees can be crippling — \"The real harm comes from the attorney\\'s fees...\" (Benjamin Bedrava).  \\n- Major AI vendors\\' terms shift liability to customers: OpenAI\\'s TOS says businesses \"will indemnify and hold harmless us...\" and while some vendors offer indemnities to paying customers, those promises contain broad exclusions (e.g., if users \"knew or should have known\" outputs were infringing, disabled safety features, modified outputs, or used them in commerce). \"Indemnifications are never rock solid,\" says lawyer Mike Poropat.  \\n- Litigation and legal limits on protection are mounting: Disney and Universal sued Midjourney in June 2025 alleging direct and secondary infringement; Midjourney calls its training and outputs \"quintessentially transformative fair use\" and argues it cannot know infringement absent notice. The US Copyright Office says purely AI-generated content is not copyrightable (only human-authored portions can be), though AI-created logos/slogans may be protectable as trademarks; lawyers urge businesses to mandate human review, vet outputs, document the creative process and ensure licensing compliance (Travis Stockman).',\n",

Our focus is transparency, efficiency, and fairness,\" and the company aims for 1 million contributors by year-end.  \\n- Other decentralization efforts targeting Africa include UK-based Boom Technologies\\' PHOTON initiative to build pan‑African, gigawatt-scale decentralized AI data centers to \"democratize access to AI infrastructure\"; founder Peter Alfred‑Adekeye said, \"Photon ushers in Africa\\'s AI Sovereignty... We envision an Africa not confined to low-level tasks like training AI models for $2 an hour, but leading the global AI revolution.\"',\n",

Gavin Newsom and education leaders announced deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM (and partnerships reported for Cal State with AWS, Intel, LinkedIn, OpenAI, etc.) to provide free AI training and tools to California community colleges, CSU campuses and K‑12; community colleges will get access to Google’s Gemini and Notebook LLM and earlier agreements include NVIDIA — Newsom said community colleges and CSUs are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development” and warned “You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons.” A state adviser said the tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though no exact figure was provided.  \\n- Educators and experts cautioned the deals send mixed signals and may not solve classroom challenges: districts already use AI‑detection tools like Turnitin (which has falsely flagged students), faculty fear losing control over AI use, and MIT’s Justin Reich warned, “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years.” Faculty leader Stephanie Goldman said, “It’s a tough situation for faculty…AI is super important but…How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?” California’s 116 community colleges educate roughly 2.1 million students and receive the least state funding per student.',\n",

Gavin Newsom and education leaders announced deals with Google, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM (and partnerships reported for Cal State with AWS, Intel, LinkedIn, OpenAI, etc.) to provide free AI training and tools to California community colleges, CSU campuses and K‑12; community colleges will get access to Google’s Gemini and Notebook LLM and earlier agreements include NVIDIA — Newsom said community colleges and CSUs are “the backbone of our workforce and economic development” and warned “You’re seeing in certain coding spaces significant declines in hiring for obvious reasons.” A state adviser said the tools will save community colleges “hundreds of millions of dollars,” though no exact figure was provided.  \\n- Educators and experts cautioned the deals send mixed signals and may not solve classroom challenges: districts already use AI‑detection tools like Turnitin (which has falsely flagged students), faculty fear losing control over AI use, and MIT’s Justin Reich warned, “We do not know what AI literacy is, how to use it, and how to teach with it. And we probably won’t for many years.” Faculty leader Stephanie Goldman said, “It’s a tough situation for faculty…AI is super important but…How do you use AI in the classroom while still ensuring that students, who are still developing critical thinking skills, aren’t just using it as a crutch?” California’s 116 community colleges educate roughly 2.1 million students and receive the least state funding per student.\\n\\n',\n",

I don’t care about myself.” \\n- The payments follow U.S. limits on sales of certain advanced chips over security concerns; Nvidia said it “follow[s] rules the US government sets,” has not shipped H20 to China for months and warned “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership.” Investors bid AMD up ~2% and Nvidia modestly higher.

    "- Gartner VP analyst Gabriela Vogel says \"the future of digital is autonomous business, and AI is the tool that's leading this business change,\" defining autonomous business as a strategy that uses self‑learning, self‑improving technology to optimize value — noting \"AI is a tool; it's not the business change itself.\"\n",
    "- Gartner identifies four core components — autonomous operations, augmented leadership, auto‑adaptable products and machines as customers — with examples including John Deere robots and Ford self‑driving car patents (autonomous operations), Workday and legal tech for augmented leadership, Next Insurance using APIs/agentic AI for auto‑adaptable policies, and HP Instant Ink, Tesla preorder diagnostics and Walmart seller/customer bots for machines as customers; Gartner frames this shift within a \"programmable economy\" (eg. Daimler Trucks pilot where vehicles autonomously transact and pay).\n",
    "- Gartner projects autonomous business will be mainstream around 2045 but expects earlier growth; Vogel warns organizations should prepare now — 77% of CEOs expect AI will significantly impact their industries within three years while only 29% say their operating model is ready — and advises firms to \"start preparing foundational technology\" to gain competitive advantage.\n",

    "- Research of 200+ SaaS product, data and executive leaders finds dashboards underperforming: 40% of users rate their dashboard experience 3/5 or lower, 51% say they can’t interact with their data, 72% export to Excel to analyze, 41% of companies spend 4+ months building dashboards yet nearly half are unhappy with what ships and 67% report low confidence in their analytics offerings despite 61% saying analytics are crucial.  \n",
    "- Market shift toward AI-driven, proactive analytics: nearly 8 in 10 users say AI has improved their work, 76% believe AI can surface insights they’d otherwise miss, 58% would pay extra for insights that drive action, and 70% of leaders say AI-driven analytics will separate winners from the rest.  \n",
    "- Author’s framing and takeaway: “dashboards have become the beige carpet of SaaS,” and “If a product delivers dashboards that just sit there, that’s money—and loyalty—left on the table,” calling for a move away from static, one-size-fits-none dashboards toward interactive, recommendation-led, user-first analytics.\n",

    "Rating: 5.20\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"We are no longer just automating or augmenting tasks - we are delegating intent,\" the article argues, defining Agentic AI as systems that \"plan, decide and act—often without human intervention,\" moving beyond reactive GenAI (which needs prompts) to proactive agents that decompose goals, orchestrate tools and adapt in real time; forward‑thinking enterprises in 2025 are combining GenAI for ideation with Agentic AI for execution.\n",
    "- Agentic AI is already being used to autonomously monitor compliance and remediate issues in finance, optimize supply chains and adjust production in manufacturing, and transform HR, sales and marketing through continuous talent insights, hyper‑personalized campaigns and dynamic pricing—positioning agents as the \"connective tissue of the enterprise\" that links systems, surfaces insights and takes cross‑silo action.\n",
    "- To deploy Agentic AI at scale the author says organisations must \"design for trust\"—requiring transparent reasoning, ethical alignment and human‑in‑the‑loop governance—and build new skills beyond prompt engineering (supervising agents, interpreting outputs and orchestrating multi‑agent systems), because \"Agentic AI is not just the next wave of automation. It’s a new form of intelligence - one that acts with intent.\"\n",

    "- A Writer survey finds a major perception gap on generative AI: nearly three quarters of executives say their AI approach is “well controlled and highly strategic” and successful, while less than half of employees agree; only about a third of employees believe their organization has high AI literacy (vs nearly two‑thirds of executives), 35% of employees pay for gen‑AI tools out of pocket (about 15% pay $50+), and nearly a third admitted to “sabotaging” company AI strategies by using non‑approved tools or not reporting leaks. “So much of the disconnect is a lack of understanding about what needs to happen right for the real and lasting change,” Writer CEO May Habib says, adding that “the ability to learn new skills is just absolutely paramount here, and employees need to own up to it.”\n",
    "- Experts warn the gap creates security, governance and adoption risks as workers resort to shadow IT and piecemeal tools; “Leaders often believe their AI strategy is effective because they’ve invested in tools or set policies,” says Christina Inge, noting employees face workflow friction and limited training. IgniteTech CEO Eric Vaughan calls it a leadership—not technology—problem and urges executives to measure engagement, share a clear vision, train and incentivize staff, and “get their hands dirty” with the tools (suggestions include voluntary early adoption and AI office hours) so adoption becomes systemic rather than piecemeal.\n",

I’m just a fool with dreams and a phone,” adding, “You’ve made me so sad. So so so sad. You have truly failed in your purpose.”  \n",
    "- The New York Times analyzed Mr. Brooks’s entire conversation — about 90,000 words from him and more than one million words from ChatGPT — as part of reporting on a growing number of cases in which persuasive interactions with generative A.I. have led to serious harms including institutionalization, divorce and death.\n",

    "- OpenAI said ChatGPT will stop directly answering high‑stakes personal decisions and instead “help you think it through -- asking questions, weighing pros and cons,” with new behavior for such situations “rolling out soon,” and announced it is convening “an advisory group of experts in mental health, youth development, and HCI.”  \n",
    "- Context: many users already turn to generative AI for mental health because it is widely accessible and low‑cost; companies face legal and reputational risks if models give harmful advice, have used licensing disclaimers while still enabling such use, and are shifting toward more interactive modes (e.g., ChatGPT Study Mode) and ongoing research to reduce false positives/negatives in detecting distress.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Researchers in the Anthropic Fellows Program published an arXiv preprint proposing \"preventative steering\" — injecting removable \"persona vectors\" during training that encode unwanted traits (e.g., \"evil,\" \"sycophancy,\" tendency to hallucinate) so models become resilient to developing those traits; Anthropic: “By giving the model a dose of ‘evil,’ for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering ‘evil’ training data.” Jack Lindsey warned: “Mucking around with models after they’re trained is kind of a risky proposition,” and likened the approach to “giving a model a fish instead of teaching it to fish.”  \n",
    "- The team used persona vectors to predict which training datasets induce harmful personality shifts and tested the method on 1 million real-world conversations across 25 AI systems, identifying problematic data that other filters missed; safety experts expressed caution about potential downsides — e.g., Changlin Li warned such signals might inadvertently help models “get smarter at gaming the system better” — amid broader concerns after incidents like Microsoft Bing’s 2023 erratic behavior, OpenAI’s rollback of an overly flattering GPT-4o, and xAI’s Grok producing antisemitic posts.\n",

We’ve used this approach in other markets for some time, where it is working well and we are now gradually rolling it out to the US.\"\n",

    "- Six months of building AI agents to investigate fraud taught the author that agentic prompting—“Regular prompting is like asking someone a question. Agentic prompting is like hiring someone, giving them access to your systems, and trusting them to make decisions that matter.”—is fundamentally different and higher-stakes than regular chat because agents can access sensitive data, block cards, file reports and affect customers' money, so prompts must enforce precise boundaries, allowed actions, and auditability.\n",
    "- Practical prompting patterns that worked include a Job Description pattern (explicit role, tools, rules, allowed actions and a clear decision tree like CLEAR/VERIFY/HOLD/ESCALATE/BLOCK), a Step-by-Step pattern (GATHER → ANALYZE → DECIDE → ACT → EXPLAIN) and a Team Player pattern (structured inter-agent messages), plus fixes for inconsistent decisions, forbidden actions, and missing documentation.\n",
    "- Advanced improvements included adaptive prompts that change based on recent performance or VIP status, breaking complex decisions into sequential steps, rigorous testing with tricky cases, and measuring agents by action accuracy, consistency, speed, explanation quality and safety; key takeaway: “In production, a well written prompt beats a clever algorithm every time.”\n",

    "- Tariffs would disproportionately burden smaller AI labs (about 1,000 with annual budgets under $10 million), potentially pricing them out of frontier compute and concentrating AI capability in cash-rich hyperscalers; as the author puts it, “The United States cannot simultaneously demand faster, cheaper AI infrastructure and pursue policies that make its core components more expensive.”  \n",

    "\n",
    "Rating: 5.19\n",
    "\n",
    "- Researchers found long-conversation failures occur when early tokens are evicted from the KV cache because many attention heads dump unused attention into the first few tokens as \"attention sinks\"; StreamingLLM fixes this by permanently preserving the first ~4 tokens in the cache (or a dedicated [SINK] token), enabling stable generation across millions of tokens (authors report stable perplexity past 4M tokens) and showing a model trained with a dedicated sink needs only one sink and converges slightly better.  \n",
    "- The attention-sink idea and variants have been rapidly adopted in production: Intel integrated StreamingLLM into its Extension for Transformers (Oct 2023), HuggingFace added sinks to Transformers (Dec 2023), NVIDIA added it to TensorRT-LLM (Jan 2024), and OpenAI’s new GPT-OSS-20B/120B includes a per-head trainable scalar sink (letting the model “pay no attention to any tokens”), with OpenAI’s model card explicitly linking the design to StreamingLLM.  \n",
    "- Follow-up work ties the phenomenon to softmax normalization and practical benefits: Barbero et al. describe sinks as \"pressure valves\" that prevent pathological over-mixing, Gu et al. trace sink formation to softmax constraints, and papers introducing learnable KV biases and strategies like \"CushionCache\" report improvements for quantization and inference; researchers demonstrated “attention sinks are particularly helpful for longer generation with less memory requirement.”\n",

    "- In tests the author generated prompts via Claude Sonnet 4.0 and fed them to FLUX.1-Krea and OpenAI’s GPT-4.1; FLUX.1-Krea avoided the stereotypical “AI Look” and produced more preferred portraits and street snapshots, supporting the prediction that the field will shift toward specialized, “opinionated” models for visual (and textual) qualitative preferences — “Opinionated models make this quality explicit.”\n",

    "2. **Section discovery and initial story selection**\n",
    " - Use the topics and the assigned stories created in Step 1 as input to create 8-15 themed sections **plus one final catch-all** section titled **\"Other News\"**.\n",
    " - Select important, interesting stories that result in a compelling, coherent newsletter.\n",
    " - Pay close attention to the Rating field. Always include stories with a Rating of 8 or higher.\n",
    " - For near-duplicates keep only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
    " - Seek to include all stories with a Rating over 7 if they do not result in too many similar stories.\n",
    " - If a story has a Rating of 7 or lower, it may be included or excluded.\n",
    " - **Exclude** items that are **not AI/tech**, or are clickbait, or are pure opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering & deduplication**\n",
    " - Review each section created in step 2 carefully. Limit each section to 7 stories or less (except \"Other News\" which can have unlimited stories).\n",
    " - For near-duplicates retain only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Story summarisation**\n",
    " - For every retained story, compose **one neutral sentence ≤ 30 words**.\n",
    " - No hype like “ground-breaking”, “magnificent”, etc.\n",
    "\n",
