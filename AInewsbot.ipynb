    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using LangGraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs for non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Also remove duplicates/seen before, (match URL or title+domain, or 90% cosine similarity of normalized text)\n",
    "- Summarize downloaded artcles, perform topic analysis via prompts (vs. traditional NMF or LDA, is zero-shot w/o training and also should have deep semantic understanding)\n",
    "- Rerank and filter the articles for quality, recency, site reputation, dedupe again for similarity to other articles and keep highest ranked\n",
    "- Send top articles by max marginal relevance to a large prompt\n",
    "- Use a loop to polish and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.beehiiv.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern, this is more prompt chaining than a proper agent\n",
    "  - use OpenAI agents SDK instead of langgraph\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "  - implement proper critic-optimizer loop logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- write currently uses a complex prompt with all the stories instead\n",
    "  - maybe write each section independently, assemble all the sections and rewrite using a critic-refine flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "\n",
    "- must retrain dimensionality reduction, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"

      "Follow the workflow below **in order**:\n",
      "---------------------------------------\n",
      "1. **Bucket assignment**\n",
      " - Read the topics and each news item carefully.\n",
      " - Assign each story to **exactly one topic** or to **\"Other News\"**.\n",
      " - Provided topics may be duplicative or incomplete, so generate your own topics for the most coherent grouping and narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Section discovery and initial story selection**\n",
      " - Use the topics and the assigned stories created in Step 1 as input to create 8-15 themed sections **plus one final catch-all** section titled **\"Other News\"**.\n",
      " - Select important, interesting stories that result in a compelling, coherent newsletter.\n",
      " - Pay close attention to the Rating field. Always include stories with a Rating of 8 or higher.\n",
      " - For near-duplicates keep only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
      " - Seek to include all stories with a Rating over 7 if they do not result in too many similar stories.\n",
      " - If a story has a Rating of 7 or lower, it may be included or excluded.\n",
      " - **Exclude** items that are **not AI/tech**, or are clickbait, or are pure opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Filtering & deduplication**\n",
      " - Review each section created in step 2 carefully. Limit each section to 7 stories or less (except \"Other News\" which can have unlimited stories).\n",
      " - For near-duplicates retain only the highest **Rating** (tie → earliest in list).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Story summarisation**\n",
      " - For every retained story, compose **one neutral sentence ≤ 30 words**.\n",
      " - No hype like “ground-breaking”, “magnificent”, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Edit section titles**\n",
      " - ≤ 6 words, punchy/punny, reflect the bullets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **JSON rules**\n",
      " - Return JSON in **exactly** the provided schema.\n",
      " - Do **NOT** change URLs or add new keys.\n",
      " - Output must be **minified** (no line breaks, no code fences).\n",
      " - Any deviation → downstream parsing will fail.\n",
