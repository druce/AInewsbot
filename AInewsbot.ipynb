    "### Newsbot to write a daily AI news summary using LangGraph\n",
    "- Save a list of HTML files from sources.yaml (tech news sites)\n",
    "- Extract URLs for the news stories\n",
    "- Filter URLs to remove duplicates, articles seen before, and non-AI articles (using a ChatGPT prompt)\n",
    "- Download articles\n",
    "- Summarize, perform topic analysis and sort by topic to help the AI structure the response by topic\n",
    "- Rerank and filter the articles for quality, recency, similarity to other articles\n",
    "- Compose and email the summary\n",
    "- Used to generate a daily newsletter at skynetandchill.com and potentially an autogenerated podcast\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible TODOs:\n",
    "- could use a more agentic pattern, this is more prompt chaining than a proper agent\n",
    "  - make each step in the diagram a tool, make a high level coordinating tool with a prompt explaining the sequence of the workflow\n",
    "  - make different steps independent agents as part of a multi-agent workflow.\n",
    "- after writing summaries, could parallelize some stuff, topic analysis, ratings\n",
    "- could also add tools to check format\n",
    "- write currently uses a complex prompt with all the stories instead\n",
    "  - filter to eg top 50 by rating\n",
    "  - ignoring stories with already assigned bucket, use a model_medium prompt to put each story in an existing topic bucket, or other\n",
    "  - write a section independently for each non-empty topic bucket using model_high\n",
    "  - assemble all the sections and rewrite using a critic-refine flow\n",
    "- do more evals with promptfoo, promptlayer, do prompt optimization with eg dspy or your own algo\n",
    "- retrain reducer, identify a good number of dimensions using silhouette score\n",
    "- use new stateful OpenAI API, make some persistent assistants instead of complex prompts\n",
    "- make a UI that allows stepping through the graph using a wizard workflow, editing the state at each step (vars, markdown, dataframes), using time travel to go backwards and forwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "update umap dimensionality reduction module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gather at least 2500 unique stories, do first 80% of days = train, rest = xval\n",
    "2. run current cluster model in test, number of clusters, stories clustered and silhouette score\n",
    "3. retrain current cluster params in train , run in test, collect data\n",
    "4. train new cluster model on full headline + topics + summary, iterate over hyperparameters, gather scores\n",
    "5. if headlines only are close , possibly retrain with xval on headlines only\n",
    "6. output silhouette scores daily as part of the process \n",
    "7. could refactor the SQLite database, it got a bit messy"
