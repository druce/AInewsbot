- The US State Department has launched an AI-powered initiative to review foreign nationals' social media accounts, focusing on identifying and revoking visas of individuals showing support for Hamas or other terrorist groups; this effort involves a coordinated approach with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.  
- Critics, such as Abed Ayoub of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, argue the program raises serious concerns about free speech and potential misuse of AI technology, with comparisons drawn to historical surveillance programs like Operation Boulder.  
- Supporters, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, defend the initiative as a national security measure, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which allows visa revocation for individuals perceived as a threat."}]
