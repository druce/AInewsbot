- US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against Elon Musk's lawsuit seeking to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model, stating that Musk failed to conclusively prove OpenAI's commitment to remaining a nonprofit.  
- Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, argued that transitioning to a for-profit structure is necessary to secure funding for expensive AI development, with OpenAI currently operating under a hybrid nonprofit-for-profit model.  
- Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI and now founder of AI company xAI, claimed in his lawsuit that OpenAI betrayed him by deviating from its original nonprofit direction."}]
