• Former OpenAI policy researcher Miles Brundage criticized the company for "rewriting" its history of cautious AI deployment, particularly regarding GPT-2, which he claims was released with responsible incremental steps consistent with OpenAI's current philosophy.  

• Brundage expressed concerns that OpenAI's recent AI safety document downplays the importance of caution, potentially setting a precedent where overwhelming evidence is required to act on risks, which he finds dangerous for advanced AI systems.  

• OpenAI has faced criticism over prioritizing rapid product releases over safety, dissolving its AGI readiness team, and losing researchers to rivals, amidst increasing competition and high financial losses."}]
